TI  - Systematic Literature Review of Digital Three-Dimensional Superimposition Techniques to Create Virtual Dental Patients
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose: Digital developments have led to the opportunity to compose simulated patient models based on three-dimensional (3D) skeletal, facial, and dental imaging. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an update on the current knowledge, to report on the technical progress in the field of 3D virtual patient science, and to identify further research needs to accomplish clinical translation. Materials and Methods: Searches were performed electronically (MEDLINE and OVID) and manually up to March 2014 for studies of 3D fusion imaging to create a virtual dental patient. Inclusion criteria were limited to human studies reporting on the technical protocol for superimposition of at least two different 3D data sets and medical field of interest. Results: Of the 403 titles originally retrieved, 51 abstracts and, subsequently, 21 full texts were selected for review. Of the 21 full texts, 18 studies were included in the systematic review. Most of the investigations were designed as feasibility studies. Three different types of 3D data were identified for simulation: facial skeleton, extraoral soft tissue, and dentition. A total of 112 patients were investigated in the development of 3D virtual models. Conclusion: Superimposition of data on the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and/or dentition is a feasible technique to create a virtual patient under static conditions. Three-dimensional image fusion is of interest and importance in all fields of dental medicine. Future research should focus on the real-time replication of a human head, including dynamic movements, capturing data in a single step.

TI  - Systematic Review of Flexor Tendon Rehabilitation Protocols in Zone II of the Hand
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Restoration of function following flexor tendon repair in zone II represents a difficult clinical problem. Despite many publications on rehabilitation methods, there exists no consensus as to which method is superior. This study was undertaken to determine which flexor tendon rehabilitation protocol provides the best outcome after surgical repair in zone II.Methods: Electronic databases were searched for articles published between 1970 and 2009. The population included patients aged 5 years and older who sustained a flexor tendon laceration in zone II. The primary outcome was rupture rate. Secondary outcomes were range of motion and quality of life. The following protocols and their variations were considered: passive flexion and active extension protocols (Kleinert type protocols), controlled passive motion protocols (Duran type protocols), combination of the Kleinert and Duran protocols, and early active motion protocols.Results: Seventy-nine articles were identified. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The mean rate of rupture was lowest in the combined Kleinert and Duran protocols (2.3 percent) and highest in the Kleinert protocols (7.1 percent). No statistically significant differences were found. The combined Kleinert and Duran protocols and the early active motion protocols exhibited the highest proportion of digits with excellent or good results using the Strickland and Buck-Gramcko systems. One study included a quality-of-life assessment-meaningful comparison was not possible.Conclusions: Both early active motion protocols and combined Kleinert and Duran protocols result in low rates of tendon rupture and acceptable range of motion following flexor tendon repair in zone II. Future studies should include quality-of-life measurements using validated scales. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 127: 1583, 2011.)

TI  - Systematic distortions of perceived planar surface motion in active vision
PY  - 2010
AB  - Recent studies suggest that the active observer combines optic flow information with extra-retinal signals resulting from head motion. Such a combination allows, in principle, a correct discrimination of the presence or absence of surface rotation. In Experiments 1 and 2, observers were asked to perform such discrimination task while performing a lateral head shift. In Experiment 3, observers were shown the optic flow generated by their own movement with respect to a stationary planar slanted surface and were asked to classify perceived surface rotation as being small or large. We found that the perception of surface motion was systematically biased. We found that, in active, as well as in passive vision, perceived surface rotation was affected by the deformation component of the first-order optic flow, regardless of the actual surface rotation. We also found that the addition of a null disparity field increased the likelihood of perceiving surface rotation in active, but not in passive vision. Both these results suggest that vestibular information, provided by active vision, is not sufficient for veridical 3D shape and motion recovery from the optic flow.

TI  - TACTILE ACTIVITY IN PRIMATE PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX DURING ACTIVE ARM MOVEMENTS - CORRELATION WITH RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES
PY  - 1994
AB  - 1. Five hundred ninety-five single neurons with tactile receptive fields (RFs) on the contralateral arm were isolated in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of awake, behaving monkeys. 2. Fifty-eight percent of the tactile cells showed significantly different levels of activity during active movements of the arm in eight directions or during active maintenance of the arm over the target endpoints. 3. The discharge of many of the active tactile cells was unimodally tuned with movement direction and the pattern of the tactile population activity varied in a meaningful fashion with arm movement direction and posture. 4. The intensity of the arm-movement-induced activity was typically less than that evoked by direct tactile stimulation of the cell's RF. 5. The probability of task-related activity was correlated with certain RF properties, in particular the sensitivity of the cell to lateral stretch of the skin and to passive arm movements that avoided direct contact of the RF on any surface. 6. This suggests that task-related activity results mainly from the activation of tactile receptors by mechanical deformation of the skin as the arm changes geometry during movement. 7. These results demonstrate that tactile activity containing potential proprioceptive information is generated in SI during active arm movements that avoid direct contact of the skin with external surfaces. Whether or not this input contributes to the kinesthetic sensations evoked by the movements cannot be resolved by this study.

TI  - TACTILE SPATIAL ANISOTROPY WITH STATIC STIMULATION
PY  - 1992
AB  - Tactile discrimination of stimulus-orientation discrepancy from standard or referent vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations was investigated. A two-alternative forced-choice paradigm was used in which stimuli were presented statically to the distal pads of subjects' right and left index fingers. The results from the present experiment were consistent with previous work employing dynamic tactile stimulation in which a similar and substantial oblique effect was obtained. Specifically, comparison orientations were discriminated more accurately with less deviation from standard vertical and horizontal stimulus orientations than from standard right- and left-diagonal stimulus orientations. The results are discussed in terms of likely underlying sensory mechanisms.

TI  - TACTUAL DISCRIMINATION OF SOFTNESS
PY  - 1995
AB  - 1. We investigated the ability of humans to tactually discriminate the softness of objects, using novel elastic objects with deformable and rigid surfaces. For objects with deformable surfaces, we cast transparent rubber specimens with variable compliances. For objects with rigid surfaces (''spring cells'') we fabricated telescoping hollow cylinders with the inner cylinder supported by several springs. To measure the human discriminability and to isolate the associated information-procressing mechanisms, we performed psychophysical experiments under three conditions: 1) active touch with the normal finger, where both tactile and kinesthetic information was available to the subject; 2) active touch with local cutaneous anesthesia, so that only kinesthetic information was available; and 3) passive touch, where a computer-controlled mechanical stimulator brought down the compliant specimens onto the passive fingerpad of the subject, who therefore had only tactile information.2. We first characterized the mechanical behavior of the human fingerpad and the test objects by determining the relationship between the depth and force of indentation during constant-velocity indentations by a rigid probe. The fingerpad exhibited a pronounced nonlinear behavior in the indentation depth versus force trace such that compliance, as indicated by the local slope of the trace. decreased with increases in indentation depth. The traces for all the rubber specimens were approximately linear, indicating a constant but distinct value of compliance for each specimen. The fingerpad was more compliant than each of the rubber specimens.3. All the human subjects showed excellent softness discriminability in ranking the rubber specimens by active touch, and the subjective perception of softness correlated one-to-one with the objectively measured compliance. The ability of subjects to discriminate the compliance of spring cells was consistently poorer compared with that of the rubber specimen's.4. For pairwise discrimination of a selected set of rubber specimens, kinesthetic information alone was insufficient. However, tactile information alone was sufficient, even when the velocities and forces of specimen application were randomized. In contrast, for discriminating pairs of spring cells, tactile information alone was insufficient, and both tactile and kinesthetic information were found to be necessary.5. The differences in the sufficiency of tactile information for the discrimination of the two types of objects can be explained by the mechanics of contact of the fingerpad and its effect on tactile information. For objects with deformable surfaces, the spatial pressure distribution within the contact region depends on both the force applied and the specimen compliance. Consequently, for a given net force, skin deformation is dependent on specimen compliance and tactile information is able to encode the compliance of objects with deformable surfaces. For compliant objects with rigid surfaces, the pressure distribution and skin deformation for a given net force are independent of object compliance and therefore tactile information alone is not sufficient to encode their compliance.

TI  - TENDON EXCURSIONS AFTER FLEXOR TENDON REPAIR IN ZONE-II - RESULTS WITH A NEW CONTROLLED-MOTION PROGRAM
PY  - 1993
AB  - Metal markers were used to study flexor digitorum profundus tendon excursions during early controlled motion with a new program combining dynamic traction and passive flexion to all four digits. The mean excursion was 2.3 mm along the middle phalanx and 11.7 mm along the proximal phalanx. This was more than twice the mean size of excursions previously achieved with a modified traditional Kleinert traction program. The mean excursion per 10 degrees of combined distal and proximal interphalangeal controlled joint motion amounted to 73% of the corresponding excursion recorded during active motion. Taken together with the findings of our previous study on tendon excursions, the results also indicate that the magnitude of excursions induced by both the distal and the proximal interphalangeal joints during controlled motion has a significant effect on adhesion formation and clinical results. However, in the region of 6 to 9 mm there appears to be a threshold beyond which the effect of a further increase in excursions becomes insignificant.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Delaying in caring restricted shoulder’s joint motion among haemiplegia patients lead to worsen conditions, which are characterized by the limitations of active and passive movement on the entire movement of the shoulder joint. This study aims to determine the effect of Diathermy Micro Wave therapy and translational traction on the changes in joint motion of shoulder hemiplegia with frozen shoulder. This research uses pre-experiment pre-posttest one group design. The study population was hemiplegic patients with frozen shoulder movement dysfunction. The sample was 15 the patiens in the population those chosed based onpurposive sampling consideration with 30 - 50 years aged. The result of statistical analisys showed that paired t-test for the extent of exorotation of the shoulder joint before and after MWD and traction-translation revealed significant differences with p = 0.014 <α = 0.05; wilcoxone test for abduction before and after administration of MWD and traction-translation made significant different with value of p=0.046 < α=0.05; and wilcoxon test for endorotation shoulder joint area before and after administration of Diathermy Microwaves and traction-translations showed significant differences (p = 0.001 <α = 0.05). The conclusion of this research is the provision of Diathermy Micro Wave intervention and traction-translation can increase the distance of motion abduction, exorotation and endorotation of shoulder joints of Hemiplegia patients with shoulder joint disfunction.

TI  - TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES IN FLOODED GRASSLAND : A LITERATURE REVIEW Author ( s ): Nathalie Plum TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES IN FLOODED GRASSLAND :
PY  - 2005
AB  - I reviewed information from 73 sources on soil animals in flooded grassland, focusing on soil macrofauna: snails and slugs (Gastropoda), earthworms (Lumbricidae), potworms (Enchytraeidae), woodlice (Isopoda), millipedes (Chilopoda, Diplopoda), Diptera, and other insect larvae. While the database on earthworms was rather comprehensive, studies on all other soil fauna groups, especially regarding their role in wetlands were few and showed major research needs. The survival strategies of the groups were compared systematically. Annelids and insect larvae had the best physiological adaptations, other groups only reacted with evasion by active or passive movement and by recolonization and reproduction from resistant stages. There were no typical "wetland species" in soil macrofauna, only tolerant hygrophilous species. Flooding of grassland immediately reduced diversity, abundance, and biomass of all groups of soil macrofauna. Their community structure was altered, and well-adapted species, often wide-spread opportunists, became more abundant while others disappeared. The effects increased with the duration of flooding and rising temperature but were usually compensated for during the next soil-dry period. A meta-analysis classified sites according to duration, frequency, and seasonality of inundation. In general, species numbers and abundances of earthworms, woodlice, and millipedes tended to be lower in frequently and/or extensively flooded sites. Only gastropods are favored by moderate winter flooding. In bogs, even when they are waterlogged the entire year, species numbers are distinctly higher than the most frequently flooded sites. The impact of episodic summer flooding events is transitional and less pronounced than that of regular winter flooding. Earthworms re-establish soil structure after flooding, and they are, next to dipteran larvae, an important prey for wetland birds. Slow, moderate flooding in winter, waterlogging in spring, and a landscape mosaic with non-flooded refuge sites is recommended for water management policies favorable for both soil fauna and wetland birds.

TI  - TEXTURE-PERCEPTION VIA ACTIVE TOUCH
PY  - 1994
AB  - The importance of movement in texture perception by touch has long been appreciated, but problematic issues related to the utilization of information during active touch persist. How is the repeated demonstration of active-passive equivalence in perceptual sensitivity to felt texture to be interpreted? What does such equivalence imply about the source(s) of information used to make perceptual judgments of texture? What sort of perceptual subsystem is organized to recover texture by touch? What is the role played by the action system in this recovery? The seminal observations of David Katz and J.J. Gibson are recounted and contemporary research is described. Several unresolved issues are outlined, as are several approaches by which the availability and utilization of information within this particular perceptual-action subsystem can be empirically studied.

TI  - THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF STATIC STRETCHING ON THE SPRINT PERFORMANCE OF COLLEGIATE MEN IN THE 60-AND 100-M DASH AFTER A DYNAMIC WARM-UP
PY  - 2010
AB  - Kistler, BM, Walsh, MS, Horn, TS, and Cox, RH. The acute effects of static stretching on the sprint performance of collegiate men in the 60-and 100-m dash after a dynamic warm-up. J Strength Cond Res 24(9): 2280-2284, 2010-Previous research has shown that static stretching has an inhibitory effect on sprinting performances up to 50 m. The purpose of this study was to see what would happen to these effects at longer distances such as those seen in competition. This study used a within-subjects design to investigate the effects of passive static stretching vs. no stretching on the 60-and 100-m sprint performance of college track athletes after a dynamic warm-up. Eighteen male subjects completed both the static stretching and the no stretching conditions in counterbalanced order across 2 days of testing. On each day, all subjects first completed a generalized dynamic warm-up routine that included a self-paced 800-m run, followed by a series of dynamic movements, sprint, and hurdle drills. At the end of this generalized warm-up, athletes were assigned to either a static stretching or a no-stretching condition. They then immediately performed 2 100-m trials with timing gates set up at 20, 40, 60, and 100 m. Results revealed a significant slowing in performance with static stretching (p < 0.039) in the second 20 (20-40) m of the sprint trials. After the first 40 m, static stretching exhibited no additional inhibition of performance in a 100-m sprint. However, although there was no additional time loss, athletes never gained back the time that was originally lost in the first portion of the trials. Therefore, in strict terms of performance, it seems harmful to include static stretching in the warm-up protocol of collegiate male sprinters in distances up to 100 m.

TI  - THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT SCREEN TM , Y-BALANCE TEST, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTS IN MALE AND FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background Poor balance, lack of neuromuscular control, and movement ability are predictors of performance and injury risk in sports and physical activity participation. The Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS™) and lower quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT) have been used by clinicians to evaluate balance, functional symmetry, and static and dynamic movement patterns, yet little information exists regarding the relationship between the FMS™, YBT, and physical performance tests (e.g. vertical jump) within the high school population. Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the FMSTM, dynamic balance as measured by the YBT and physical performance tests (standing long jump, vertical jump, Pro Agility Test) in male and female high school athletes. Study Design Cohort study. Methods Fifty-six high school athletes (28 females, 28 males; mean age 16.4 ± 0.1) who participated in organized team sports were tested. Participants performed the FMS™, YBT, and three physical performance tests (standing long jump, vertical jump, Pro Agility Test). Results Females outperformed males on the FMS™ and YBT, while males outperformed females on the performance tests. In both sexes, the composite FMSTM score was positively correlated with the left and composite YBT scores. Agility was negatively correlated with composite FMSTM in males (p < 0.05) and the left and composite YBT in females (p < 0.05). Conclusions The FMSTM and YBT may evaluate similar underlying constructs in high school athletes, such as dynamic balance and lower extremity power. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of the FMS and YBT to relate multiple constructs of muscular power to an individual's ability to balance. Furthermore, establishing the need for the utilization and application of multiple field-based tests by sports medicine professionals and strength and conditioning coaches when evaluating an athlete's movement and physical performance capabilities. Utilization of multiple field-based tests may provide the first step for the development of injury prevention strategies and long-term athlete development programs. Level of Evidence 2b.

TI  - THE CHANGES IN INTRAMUSCULAR PRESSURE AND FEMORAL VEIN FLOW WITH CONTINUOUS PASSIVE MOTION, PNEUMATIC COMPRESSIVE STOCKINGS, AND LEG MANIPULATIONS
PY  - 1991
AB  - Intramuscular pressure was measured continuously in the deep compartment of the calf and anterior thigh of volunteers while their legs were cyclically moved from 0-degrees to 90-degrees back to 0-degrees (angle of knee flexion) in an anatomic continuous passive motion (CPM) device and a nonanatomic CPM device. Femoral venous flow was measured continuously using a thermodilution technique in volunteers while their legs were moved in both CPM devices, during inflation of a pneumatic stocking, and during several leg manipulations. Baseline intramuscular pressures in the deep calf and anterior thigh were 10.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg and 4.9 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively (mean +/- standard error). Both the anatomic and nonanatomic CPM devices produced a statistically significant maximal increase in pressure in the calf. By contrast, only a decrease in pressure occurred in the thigh with both devices. Baseline femoral vein flow measured by the thermodilution technique was 311 +/- 38 ml per minute. Significant increases in femoral vein flow were seen with both CPM devices. The maximal flow produced by the anatomic CPM was 1199 ml per minute and was approximately four times higher than baseline flow and approximately 1.4 times the maximal flow change seen with the nonanatomic CPM (836 ml per minute). The greatest net increase in flow was observed between 60-degrees and 90-degrees of knee flexion with both devices. Overall, passive straight-leg elevation produced the largest flow (1524 ml per minute), followed by the anatomic CPM and nonanatomic CPM, and then by active ankle dorsiflexion (640 ml per minute), pneumatic stocking inflation (586 ml per minute), manual calf compression (532 ml per minute), and passive dorsiflexion (385 ml per minute). From these observations, it can be inferred that the calf acts as a venous pump, whereas the thigh acts as a venous reservoir. Femoral vein flow is affected more by gravity than by compartmental pressure. These data may be used to develop parameters and modalities for maximizing venous flow and venous pressure in the leg that could prevent deep venous thrombosis.

TI  - THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF ACTION OBSERVATION AND PASSIVE PROPRIOCEPTIVE TRAINING ON ADAPTIVE MOTOR LEARNING
PY  - 2016
AB  - Sensorimotor adaptation can be induced by action observation, and also by passive training. Here, we investigated the effect of a protocol that combined action observation and passive training on visuomotor adaptation, by comparing it with the effect of action observation or passive training alone. Subjects were divided into five conditions during the training session: (1) action observation, in which the subjects watched a video of a model who adapted to a novel visuomotor rotation; (2) proprioceptive training, in which the subject's arm was moved passively to target locations that were associated with desired trajectories; (3) combined training, in which the subjects watched the video of a model during a half of the session and experienced passive movements during the other half; (4) active training, in which the subjects adapted actively to the rotation; and (5) a control condition, in which the subjects did not perform any task. Following that session, all subjects adapted to the same visuomotor rotation. Results showed that the subjects in the combined training condition adapted to the rotation significantly better than those in the observation or proprioceptive training condition, although their performance was not as good as that of those who adapted actively. These findings suggest that although a protocol that combines action observation and passive training consists of all the processes involved in active training (error detection and correction, effector-specific and proprioceptively based reaching movements), these processes in that protocol may work differently as compared to a protocol in which the same processes are engaged actively.

TI  - THE COMPARISON OF TWO ROOM COMPENSATION / DEREVERBERATION METHODS EMPLOYING ACTIVE ACOUSTIC BOUNDARY ABSORPTION
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this paper, we compare the performance of two active dereverberation techniques using a planar array of microphones and loudspeakers. The two techniques are based on a solution to the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Integral Equation (KHIE). We adapt a Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) based method to the application of real-time 3D dereverberation by using a low-latency pre-filter design. The use of First-Order Differential (FOD) models is also proposed as an alternative method to the use of monopoles with WFS and which does not assume knowledge of the room geometry or primary sources. The two methods are compared by observing the suppression of reflections off a single active wall over the volume of a room in the time and (temporal) frequency domain. The FOD method provides better suppression of reflections than the WFS based method but at the expense of using higher order models.

TI  - THE CREATION OF INTERACTIVE LISTENING GUIDES FOR NONMUSIC MAJORS
PY  - 2015
AB  - Project backgroundThis project was part of a much larger initiative, the Center for the Performing Arts Classical Music Project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The goals of the three-year Classical Music Project (CWP) were to provide increased opportunities for students, faculty and community members to engage with classical music artists and programs.To prepare students to benefit more strongly from the performances attended, the Center and the School of Music modified an existing course, Music 5: An Introduction to Western Music, to dovetail with scheduled Center performances. A new course module based on genre-specific active listening would be included each semester, augmented by interactive listening guides for opera, symphonic, and classical music.Perceived barriers to guided listeningJohn Packard, lead faculty for the development of the new Music 5 modules, cited a number of issues he encountered previously in teaching non-music majors in Music 5: incomplete/passive listening, inadequacy of available listening guide designs (from the web or textbook publishers), lack of visual reference to music structure, lack of precise player control for in-class demonstration, and a "disjointedness" between the students' real-time listening and his commentary meant to guide that listening.Instructional designWe intend to show a solid pedagogical foundation for the listening guide approach as it exemplifies Mayer's SOI (Selecting/Organizing/Integrating) model for constructivist learning.Authoring system technology solutionWe chose SuddenlySmart's SmartBuilder web-based authoring system as our development tool for the guides. SmartBuilder proved to be a powerful authoring system, although somewhat cumbersome to develop with.Initial design and refinementThe Opera module and associated listening guides were built first and piloted in the spring semester of 2013. Significant design revision occurred in summer of 2013, in time for creation of the symphonic and chamber music guides. The version 1.0 opera guides were later updated to the new design.Takeaways and implicationsWhile no formal evaluation was conducted, several observations can be made that may prove valuable to an INTED audience. Among them are:- Once refined, these interactive listening guides proved to be instructionally effective- While aimed at non-music majors, School of Music faculty agreed that these guides could also play a role for music majors as well- Aspects of leveraging the investment of time and money across a whole curriculum- Discussion of barriers to leverage- Exploration of "parallel" initiatives at audience institutions-what might this look like for them?

TI  - THE DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF ULTRASONIC THERAPEUTIC TRANSDUCERS USING LEAD-FREE Na0.5K0.5NbO3 BASED CERAMICS
PY  - 2010
AB  - In this paper, lead-free Na0.5K0.5NbO3 (NKN) based piezoelectric ceramics are synthesized by the conventional mixed-oxide methods with sintering temperature at 900-1050 degrees C. Microstructural analyses of un-doped and CuO-doped ceramics have been carried out and compared using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The dependence of the sintering temperatures of the CuO-doped NKN ceramics on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been investigated. The results show that the CuO-doped NKN specimens sintered at 1020 degrees C present the high thickness coupling factor, k(t) (>0.50), mechanical quality factor Q(m) =1100 and the lower temperature coefficient of resonance frequency in thickness mode (df(r)/f(r)<2%) within the temperature range 20-100 degrees C. Then, we successfully construct 3-MHz transducers (LF transducer) utilizing our fabricated piezoceramics and examine their static resonant characteristics. Simultaneously, their dynamic acoustic power is measured by the acoustic force balance under a power circuit driving with the intermittent pulse control as compared to the commercial transducers. We find the effective coupling factor of LF transducer (0.05) is superior to that of commercial transducer (0.45).

TI  - THE DYNAMIC TREATMENT OF THE LOW BACK STRAIN SYNDROME.
PY  - 1964
AB  - The modalities at present in use for the treatment of soft-tissue injuries responsible for the low back strain syndrome are predominantly passive, yet similar soft-tissue injuries elsewhere in the body receive and respond to an early program of active movement. To assess the feasibility of such an approach to the low back strain syndrome, a program of therapeutic exercises with and without the addition of heat and massage was employed for the treatment of this condition. Exercises alone were found to be as effective as a program of "heat, massage and exercises" in resolving the presenting complaints. At the same time this dynamic approach served to reduce the undesirable effects, both local and general, of the enforced inactivity of the patient.

TI  - THE EDGE ROLL OFF GENERATION MECHANISM IN POLISHING BY CONSIDERING THE VISCOELASTICITY OF POLISHING PADS
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recently, the achievement of further high flatness of workpiece edge shape is strongly required in mirror finishing. Especially, the edge roll off of silicon wafers as the substrates of semiconductor devices is demanded to decrease in the polishing process for raising the yield of IC chips. Many theoretical and experimental analyses of the edge roll off generation have been already done and the polishing methods for suppressing the roll off have been proposed to meet the demand. The analyses, however, cannot fully account for the obtained edge shape in actual polishing and the problem about the roll off remains. In this study, the generation mechanism of the edge roll off based on the viscoelasticity of polishing pad was newly proposed. The mechanism considered the horizontal and vertical relative static and dynamic motion between the pad and the workpiece. Moreover, the non-contact viscoelasticity measurement instrument was originally developed to evaluate the viscoelasticity of the polishing pad precisely. A series of polishing experiments for silicon wafers revealed that the edge shape, which was induced from the edge roll off generation mechanism and the measured viscoelasticity of the polishing pad, corresponded well with the obtained edge shape.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF CONTINUOUS PASSIVE MOTION ON KNEE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION WITH CARBON-FIBER - AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION
PY  - 1991
AB  - Our purpose was to determine whether continuous passive motion enhanced the quality of knee ligament reconstruction using carbon fibre.In 46 rabbits the medial collateral ligaments were excised and replaced with carbon fibre prostheses. The animals were treated postoperatively by either continuous passive motion, cast immobilisation or cage activity, termed intermittent active motion.At six weeks, the ligaments were compared histologically and biochemically with normal (control) medial collateral ligaments and with sham-operated controls. The ligaments treated with continuous passive motion were superior to those in the other two treatment groups. There were no ligament failures in any of the groups.This study suggests that continuous passive motion, initiated immediately postoperatively, enhances the biomechanical properties of carbon fibre ligament replacement of the medial collateral ligament while preventing the harmful effects of joint immobilisation.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF LATERALIZED DYNAMIC STIMULI ON UNILATERAL SPATIAL NEGLECT FOLLOWING RIGHT-HEMISPHERE LESIONS
PY  - 1990
AB  - Patients with unilateral (left-sided) spatial neglect following right-hemisphere stroke were tested for the effects of visual stimulation on performance of a line-bisection task. As predicted from research on brain mechanisms of spatial orientation and attention, dynamic visual stimuli presented on the left side substantially reduced neglect in the task. In contrast, left sided static stimuli reduced neglect significantly less and dynamic stimuli presented in the center had no effect on neglect. Neglect patients with hemianopia did not show significantly less benefit of left-sided dynamic stimuli compared to neglect patients without hemianopia, suggesting that the effect of these stimuli was unconscious and automatic. The potential advantages of lateralized dynamic stimuli in the rehabilitation of neglect are discussed.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF PASSIVE LISTENING VERSUS ACTIVE OBSERVATION OF MUSIC AND DANCE PERFORMANCES ON MEMORY RECOGNITION AND MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION IN COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED OLDER ADULTS
PY  - 2012
AB  - The study examined the effects of music therapy and dance/movement therapy on cognitively impaired and mild to moderately depressed older adults. Passive listening to music and active observation of dance accompanied by music were studied in relation to memory enhancement and relief of depressive symptoms in 100 elderly board and care residents. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Recognition Memory Test Faces Inventory were administered to two groups (one group exposed to a live 30-min. session of musical dance observation, the other to 30 min. of pre-recorded music alone) before the intervention and measured again 3 and 10 days after the intervention. Scores improved for both groups on both measures following the interventions, but the group exposed to dance therapy had significantly lower Beck Depression scores that lasted longer. These findings suggest that active observation of Dance Movement Therapy could play a role in temporarily alleviating moderate depressive symptoms and some cognitive deficits in older adults.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF PULSED ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS IN THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE AND CERVICAL-SPINE - REPORT OF RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS
PY  - 1994
AB  - Objective. We conducted a randomized, double blind clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and cervical spine.Methods. A controlled trial of 18 half-hour active or placebo treatments was conducted in 86 patients with OA of the knee and 81 patients with OA of the cervical spine, in which pain was evaluated using a 10 cm visual analog scale, activities of daily living using a series of questions (answered by the patient as never, sometimes, most of the time, or always), pain on passive motion (recorded as none, slight, moderate, or severe), and joint tenderness (recorded using a modified Ritchie scale). Global evaluations of improvement were made by the patient and examining physician. Evaluations were made at baseline, midway, end of treatment, and one month after completion of treatment.Results. Matched pair t tests showed extremely significant changes from baseline for the treated patients in both knee and cervical spine studies at the end of treatment and the one month followup observations, whereas the changes in the placebo patients showed lesser degrees of significance at the end of treatment, and had lost significance for most variables at the one month followup. Means of the treated group of patients with OA of the knee showed greater improvement from baseline values than the placebo group by the end of treatment and at the one month followup observation. Using the 2-tailed t test, at the end of treatment the differences in the means of the 2 groups reached statistical significance for pain, pain on motion, and both the patient overall assessment and the physician global assessment. The means of the treated patients with OA of the cervical spine showed greater improvement from baseline than the placebo group for most variables at the end of treatment and one month followup observations; these differences reached statistical significance at one or more observation points for pain, pain on motion, and tenderness.Conclusion. PEMF has therapeutic benefit in painful OA of the knee or cervical spine.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF TRIIODOTHYRONINE ON THE MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL AND INTRACELLULAR SODIUM AND POTASSIUM ACTIVITIES OF RAT SOLEUS AND EXTENSOR DIGITORUM LONGUS MUSCLES
PY  - 1993
AB  - Tri-iodothyronine (T-3) induces a considerable increase in the number of Na/K pump units in rat skeletal muscles, but this effect is more pronounced in red muscles, such as soleus, than in white muscles such as extensor digitorum longus (EDL). In the present study, the effect of T-3 on the membrane potential (E(m) and the intracellular activities of K+ and Na+ (aK(i) and aNa(j)) in the two muscle types has been studied using microelectrodes. Hyperthyroidism was induced by seven subcutaneous injections of 50 mu g T-3 per 100 g body weight on alternate days. Following treatment of rats with T-3, the mean T-3 concentration in the serum was 8-4 +/- 0.46 nmol/l (S.D.) compared with 1.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/l ill the serum of untreated control rats, and the heart weight/body weight ratio of the treated rats had increased from 0.29 +/- 0.01 in control rats to 0-39 +/- 0.02. In soleus muscle fibres from the T-3-treated rats, the E(m), aK(i) and aNa(i) were unchanged, whereas, in EDL muscle fibres from these rats, the E, had depolarized by 2 mV (P<0.01) and aNa(i) had increased by 2 mmol/l (P<0.05). Since T-3 induces not only an increase in the number of pump units and active movement of Na+ and K+ but also an increase in the passive fluxes of these ions, the results are discussed in terms of these two opposing ionic movements.

TI  - THE EFFICACY OF CONTINUOUS PASSIVE MOTION IN THE REHABILITATION OF ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTIONS
PY  - 1992
AB  - Seventy-five patients undergoing arthroscopically-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by the same surgeon were divided into three random subgroups. All of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions used the middle third of the ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft. Patients undergoing meniscal repair, extraarticular procedures, or repair of other ligaments were excluded. The 75 patients were divided into subgroups to assess the benefits or disadvantages of early active motion (25 patients), continuous passive motion (25 patients), and a combination of both (25 patients) during the first 30 days after surgery.All patients were evaluated at specific intervals for 6 months after surgery. Data recorded included drain output, medication usage, tourniquet time, leg involved, hospital stay length, KT-1000 testing (before surgery in the anesthetized patient, after the procedure was completed, and 2 and 6 months after surgery), and range of motion. Radiographs and the International Knee Evaluation Form were also used to evaluate the results. No statistically significant differences were found between the three groups. Side-to-side anterior-posterior differences, stability, and restoration of full range of motion were similar in each subgroup at each evaluated interval. In this prospective study of motion, started immediately after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, passive and active methods were shown to have identical results. A supervised active and passive motion program during the 1st month had the same results as either one used individually.

TI  - THE EFFICACY OF THE EYETHINKSPORT TRAINING SOFTWARE PROGRAMME ON SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH SCHOOL CRICKETERS
PY  - 2009
AB  - The issue of enhancing an already superior visual system in elite athletes has led to several investigations dealing with intervention programmes designed to enhance visual performance. The influence of visual skills enhancement programmes has been investigated (Coffey & Reichow, 1990; Calder, 2005; Love, Kluka, & Young, 2006; Kluka & Love, 2006). Researchers (Kluka & Love, 2006; Kluka, Love, Covington, Bristow, & Allison, 2000) have reported that elite athletes, when compared to nonathletes, have superior visual abilities, measured through contrast sensitivity function, peripheral vision, visual reaction time, static visual acuity, eye movements, visual concentration, visual recognition and static/dynamic balance. Practical limitations, however, involves applicability to athletes. Where geographical location is considered, access to such training is a factor. A software programme, EyeThinkSport (Calder, 2006), was developed as an internet-based, self- administered intervention. Accessed through a personal computer with an internet link, the programme was designed to improve athlete’s visual abilities and decision making. The aim of this investigation was to determine the efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme on selected cricket athletes at high school club level. Thirty high school level (aged 13 – 19) cricket players participated. Each player had at least 3 years of cricket playing experience. Participants were divided into 2 groups (E=15) and (C=15). Four phases of assessment were involved: (1) Series of preliminary visual assessments to establish testing protocol; (2) Pre-training programme assessment (pretest) using six different visual skills tests and five different cricket-specific skill tests (baseline data); (3) Three-week training programme using the EyeThinkSport software programme or a placebo; (4) Post training assessment (posttest) using 6 visual and 5 cricket-specific tests. All outcome variables were analyzed using a RM-ANOVA (group X time). Where significant interaction (p<0.05) effects were found, post-hoc analyses were performed (Tukey’s HSD). In all tests involving visual skills, E performances showed greater improvement when compared to C performances. The efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme led to significant improvements in the performance of athletes in E in almost all visual skills. In contrast, there was minimal to moderate improvement in all tests with the exception of the horizontal and vertical saccades in C. It was confirmed that the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme is suitable to use in the enhancement of selected visual and sport-specific skills in high school cricketers.

TI  - THE EFFICACY OF UPPER EXTREMITY INHIBITIVE CASTING - A SINGLE-SUBJECT PILOT-STUDY
PY  - 1993
AB  - This pilot study was designed to examine the effects of short-term (48-hr) upper extremity inhibitive casting, with an encased thermoplastic splint, on problems related to upper motor neuron damage. The subject was an 81/2-year-old girl with left upper extremity spasticity. Three different measures were used (a) rating of videotaped active movements of the child; (b) the Modified Ashworth Scale, a clinical measure of spasticity, and (c) The Biodex System, a measure of torque during passive elbow flexion and extension. After cast removal, subjective improvements were noted in the quality of active movement (through videotapes) and increased awareness and use of the casted band by the child (through parents' reports). A trend toward decreased spasticity was demonstrated by the Modified Ashworth Scale and a statistically significant decrease in resistance to passive movement was shown by the Biodex recordings However, this reduction in symptoms was temporary, lasting less than 3 days. The results of this study suggest that short-term inhibitory casting may prove efficacious in the treatment of the child with cerebral palsy, although further research is needed.

TI  - THE EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS RECOVERY STRATEGIES AFTER SPECIFIC ENDURANCE PHYSICAL LOAD AMONG SOCCER PLAYERS
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose. The study deals with evaluation of the lactate response and recovery processes among soccer players after specific endurance physical load using the selected recovery strategies.Methods. The screened sample consisted of 28 soccer players of U17 and U19 categories, who competed in the top national league (average decimal age 17.0 +/- 0.9 years; body height 178.2 +/- 4.7 cm; body weight 69.3 +/- 6.7 kg; body fat 11.3 +/- 4.5 %). The effect of the selected recovery strategies (sport massage, local cryotherapy of lower limbs, whole-body stretching, active movement and passive recovery) on the level of recovery processes was evaluated on the basis of the lactate produced over the 20-minute period after physical load. Participants were subjected to specific endurance physical load using a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test, level 1. The level of lactate was detected from capillary blood taken from the fingertips and recorded in the intervals of 3, 5, 7, 15 and 20 minutes after physical load. The baseline was the level of lactate recorded before physical load. The study is the part of VEGA 1/0622/15 scientific project titled, The effect of regeneration on recovery of the body after aerobic and anaerobic load in sport".Results. In terms of lactate metabolism, if compared between the 5th and 15th minute, the greatest decrease of the lactate level was found in participants with active movement recovery (decrease by 50.2 %), followed by massage (49.3 %), local cryotherapy of lower limbs (45.1 %), stretching (43.8 %) and passive recovery (42.4 %). In case of monitoring the entire rest phase, similar results were found, when the greatest lactate clearance was observed in participants with active recovery (decrease by 64.1 %), followed by stretching (55.3 %), massage (54.6 %), local cryotherapy of lower limbs (54.3 %) and, finally, participants with passive recovery (53.1 %). Concerning statistics, Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA was applied; however, no statistical differences were found at the level of alpha = 0.05.Conclusion. As indicated by the results, the use of active movement recovery strategy appears to be the most efficient after aerobic-anaerobic load.

TI  - THE EMERGENCE OF ALTERED POSTURAL SYNERGIES IN SUBJECTS WITH ACL DEFICIENCY
PY  - 2002
AB  - Mechanisms enabling subjects with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACL-D) to maintain functional activities are unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the postural synergies utilized in individuals with ACL-D. Four subjects with unilateral ACL-D and 9 subjects without history of lower extremity injury, participated in testing strength, proprioception and dynamic balance (DBT). Isometric testing of the quadriceps muscle,using the burst-superimposition technique, was used to test strength. Proprioception of the knee was tested using the Threshold to Detection of Passive Movement (TDPM) test. The DBT consisted of bilateral EMG recordings of leg muscles (anterior tibialis, soleus, hamstrings, quadriceps) during a 4 degree toes-down platform tip. Relative latencies and amplitudes were calculated.)Significant differences (p<.06)were noted in relative latency and amplitude of hamstring and soleus muscles, as well as relative latency of soleus and tibialis anterior. Specifically, hamstring activation was later and larger, relative to soleus, in the ACL-D group. Furthermore, the adaptation evidenced by the lack of hamstring activation in the unimpaired group was absent in the ACL-D group. Similarly, the adaptation evidenced by increased relative latency of soleus and tibialis anterior was not found in the ACL-D group. These results indicate that typical adaptation of postural responses does not occur in subjects with ACL-D. Hamstring activation may be compensating for diminished soleus responses. It is possible that the loss of proprioceptive feedback limits adaptive modulation of responses.

TI  - THE EMERGENCE OF LOW-FREQUENCY ACTIVE ACOUSTICS AS A CRITICAL ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE TECHNOLOGY
PY  - 1992
AB  - For the three decades following World War II, the United States realized unparalleled success in strategic and tactical antisubmarine warfare operations by exploiting the high acoustic source levels of Soviet submarines to achieve long detection ranges. The emergence of the quiet Soviet submarine in the 1980s mandated that new and revolutionary approaches to submarine detection be developed if the United States was to continue to achieve its traditional antisubmarine warfare effectiveness. Since it is immune to sound-quieting efforts, low-frequency active acoustics has been proposed as a replacement for traditional passive acoustic sensor systems. The underlying science and physics behind this technology are currently being investigated as part of an urgent U.S. Navy initiative, but the United States and its NATO allies have already begun development programs for fielding sonars using low-frequency active acoustics. Although these first systems have yet to become operational in deep water, research is also under way to apply this technology to Third World shallow-water areas and to anticipate potential countermeasures that an adversary may develop.

TI  - THE IN-SITU PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT OF SHINGLE MOVEMENT UNDER WAVES AND CURRENTS - INSTRUMENT (TOSCA) DEVELOPMENT AND PRELIMINARY-RESULTS
PY  - 1995
AB  - An instrumented platform (TOSCA) is described for monitoring coarse-grained sediment transport in high (wave and tidal) energy environments. The system consists of a number of sensors which measure: instantaneous current velocities at three levels; sea surface elevation; and self-generated noise (SGN) caused by intercollision of particles in transit. SGN is related to transport rates, on the basis of laboratory calibration; this, in turn, allows a correlation with simultaneous near-bed shear stress to be established. During the field measurements, PC-based real-time data transmission is realised through the use of a (buoyed) radio telemetry system.TOSCA has been deployed in eastern Christchurch Bay, southern England. Burst data were collected every 2 h, over 10 min, with a sampling frequency of 5 Hz. The data sets obtained permit detailed investigations into near-bed flow structure and shingle movement, on time-scales comparable to those of the turbulence.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF EYE MOVEMENT AND THE VESTIBULAROCULAR REFLEX IN READING AND WRITING.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose: to determine whether changes in eye movement and vestibular-ocular reflex are related to the difficulty of reading and writing. Methods: we selected 18 subjects of both genders, aged between nine and 14 years of age with hearing and static visual acuity within the normality's standars, with a group of 11 subjects with difficulty of reading and writing and another control group of seven subjects without the difficulty. The exams were the evaluations of written language, static and dynamic visual acuity, audiological and eye movements. Results: static visual acuity, calibration, spontaneous nystagmus and semi - spontaneous were within the normality's standars throughout the study population. Tests of dynamic visual acuity and saccades showed statistically significant difference (p <0.05) between the groups, while the pendular tracking showed changes in both groups, with no statistical difference. Conclusion: changes of saccadic and pendular tracking eye movements as well as poor performance of the vestibular-ocular reflex may be interfering with the difficulty of reading and writing development.

TI  - THE JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY The relationship of foot and ankle movements to venous return in the lower limb Subjects and Methods
PY  - 1999
AB  - W e have studied the relationship between movements of the foot and ankle and venous blood flow from the lower limb using colourflow Duplex ultrasound to determine the optimum type of exercise for promoting venous return. Studies of both active and passive movements were carried out on 40 limbs in 20 subjects (18 men; 2 women), with a median age of 27 years (20 to 54). We assessed ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, subtalar inversion and eversion, and a combination of all movements. There was no difference in venous flow when comparing opposite limbs in a single subject (p > 0.5), but active exercises produced higher peak and mean velocities of blood flow than passive ones. The active combined movement produced the highest velocities with an increase of 38% in mean and of 58% in peak flow velocities, which were significantly greater than the peak and mean flow rates produced by passive movements. The active combined exercise would therefore be the most effective in eliminating stasis and could contribute to the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis. There has been much debate about the most effective method of prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), especially since the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism has been established to be significantly lower than previously accepted. 1,2 Virchow's triad of the factors involved in venous thrombosis is hypercoagulability, stasis and injury to the intima. Chemical methods of prophylaxis are prim-arily directed towards decreasing coagulability; mechanical methods attempt to decrease stasis. Chemical prophylaxis is associated with a risk of mor-bidity and mortality, which many surgeons believe to be unacceptable, and therefore mechanical methods of prophy-laxis are now being used more widely. 3-5 It has long been recognised that regional anaesthesia, 6 surgical technique 1,7 and early postoperative mobilisation 8,9 can reduce the incidence of thromboembolism. Other methods such as antiembolism stockings, 10 electrical stimulation of the calf 11 and pump systems 12-14 promote venous return and have been recommended. The efficacy of antiembolism stock-ings has recently been questioned 15 and other systems may be expensive, bulky and often poorly tolerated by the patient. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between movements of the foot and ankle and venous return from the lower limb. We have compared movements in separate planes and quantified the difference between active and passive movement. The results were compared with pop-ular and effective mechanical methods of prophylaxis. This simple and inexpensive method of eliminating stasis and promoting venous return, which could be incorporated into a general rehabilitation programme, may be of benefit in reducing the risk of venous thrombosis.

TI  - THE KESSEL PROSTHESIS IN TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY - A 5-YEAR EXPERIENCE
PY  - 1992
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985, 23 Kessel total shoulder arthroplasties were performed on 22 patients. A clinical and roentgenographic review was performed by an independent observer. Three patients had their prostheses removed and three had revision surgery, leaving 17 shoulders in 16 patients available for study, all with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All patients were relieved of pain and noticed a general improvement in activities of daily living. Passive flexion and rotation were increased, but active movements remained unchanged. Roent-genographically, radiolucent zones developed around the scapular component on all patients within one year but only around one of the humeral components. Total shoulder arthroplasties with the Kessel prosthesis in RA relieved pain and improved shoulder and arm function. The long-term results were complicated by a high incidence of loosening of the glenoid component, probably a feature of the constrained design of the Kessel prosthesis.

TI  - THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TENDON JERK AS A MARKER OF PATHOLOGICAL STRETCH REFLEX ACTIVITY IN HUMAN SPASTICITY
PY  - 1993
AB  - The motor disorders associated with human spasticity arise, partly from a pathological increase in the excitability of muscle stretch reflexes. In clinical practice, reflex excitability is commonly assessed by grading the reflex response to a blow delivered to the tendon of a muscle. This is a much simpler response than the complex patterns of activity which may be elicited following muscle stretch caused by active or passive movement. Changes in the biceps brachii tendon jerk response have been followed over the first year after stroke in a group of hemiparetic patients and compared with changes in short and medium latency reflex responses elicited by imposed elbow flexion of initially relaxed spastic muscle and with the development of the late reflex responses which contribute to spastic hypertonia. A progressive increase in tendon jerk responses occurred over the first year following stroke, whereas reflex responses to imposed displacement, in particular the late reflex responses contributing to muscle hypertonia, reached their peak excitability one to three months after stroke, with a subsequent reduction in activity. The tendon jerk reflex therefore provides an incomplete picture of the pathological changes in the reflex responses in spasticity.

TI  - THE MOVEMENT-INDUCED MODULATION IN DISCRIMINABILITY BETWEEN CUTANEOUS NONPAINFUL STIMULI DEPENDS ON TEST STIMULUS-INTENSITY
PY  - 1994
AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out whether the finger movement-induced modulation of cutaneous discrimination thresholds varies with the intensity level of the test stimulation in various movement conditions. The effect of active and passive finger movement on cutaneous sensitivity to nonpainful electrical stimulation of threshold and suprathreshold intensity was studied in human subjects. The detection threshold and the just-noticeable amplitude difference (discrimination threshold) at two suprathreshold intensities (3 x and 10 x detection threshold) were determined using a forced-choice paradigm before and after (controls) or during finger movement. In one condition the stimuli were applied just prior to the movement. The finger was actively or passively moved at the frequency of 1.5 Hz or 3 Hz, and the test stimuli were applied to the moving finger, except in one condition to the contralateral finger. The contralateral condition was used to rule out vigilance- and attention-related mechanisms as a cause of sensitivity changes. Active as well as passive movement of the finger produced a significant increase in the detection threshold during the movement. Also just prior to the movement the detection threshold was increased. Suprathreshold discrimination thresholds in the moving finger were not significantly changed during or just prior to the active movement, whereas during passive movement the discrimination threshold to suprathreshold level stimulation was significantly decreased. When test stimuli were applied to the finger contralateral to the actively moving finger, neither the detection threshold nor the discrimination between stimuli of suprathreshold intensities were significantly changed. The results indicate that both active and passive movement can regionally suppress cutaneous sensitivity to threshold level stimuli, whereas discrimination between cutaneous stimuli of suprathreshold intensities can be improved or be unchanged during passive or active movement, respectively. The suppression of threshold level stimuli may be explained by both the activation of afferent-induced inhibition and corollary efferent barrage from motor to sensory areas of the brain, whereas afferent-induced mechanisms seem to have a predominant role in the improvement of discriminability between suprathreshold stimuli. The suppression of threshold sensitivity and the enhancement (or lack of suppression) of suprathreshold discriminability may be beneficial during movement allowing suppression of ''noise'' (e.g., skin receptor activation induced by moving finger) and allowing better discrimination of behaviorally relevant (suprathreshold) stimuli (e.g.. discrimination of environmental stimuli during movement).

PY  - 1995
AB  - Of 935 consecutive patients referred with shoulder pain, 50 fitted the criteria for primary frozen shoulder, Twelve patients who failed to improve after conservative treatment and manipulation had excision of the coracohumeral ligament and the rotator interval of the capsule, The specimens were histologically, using special stains for Immunocytochemistry was performed with monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte common antigen (LCA, CD45) and a macrophage/synovial antigen (PGMI, CD68) to the inflammatory component, and assess vimentin and smooth-muscle actin to evaluate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.Our histological and immunocytochemical findings show that the pathological process is active fibroblastic proliferation, accompanied by some transformation to a smooth muscle phenotype (myofibroblasts), The fibroblasts lay down collagen which appears as a thick nodular band or fleshy mass,These appearances are very similar to those in Dupuytren's disease of the hand, with no inflammation and no synovial involvement, The contracture acts as a check-rein against external rotation, causing loss of both active and passive movement.

TI  - THE PATHWAY FROM IA FORELIMB AFFERENTS TO THE MOTOR CORTEX - A NEW HYPOTHESIS
PY  - 1991
AB  - Forelimb target-reaching and food-taking in cats depend on different interneuronal circuitry in the spinal cord. On the basis of previous findings regarding the effect of transection of the corticospinal tract in the spinal cord, of high dorsal column (DC) transection, of low pyramidotomy and of pyramidotomy after previous DC transection, it is proposed that the food-taking movement is temporally linked to target-reaching as follows: During target-reaching, the position of the paw is signalled by the pathway from forelimb proprioceptors (mainly Ia) to the motor cortex with a relay in the main cuneate nucleus. The command for food-taking is issued by the motor cortex only when the pathway from the forelimb signals that the paw approaches the target correctly, as may be determined by a comparison of the information from the forelimb with an efference copy of the motor program for target-reaching. The hypothesis is based on previous results regarding the organization of the pathway from the forelimb to area 3a and the motor cortex, and regarding the cortico-cuneate pathway with selective projection from area 3a and motor cortex to the basal caudal part of the cuneate nucleus, where the proprioceptive information from the forelimb is relayed. Results relevant to the present hypothesis regarding responses of precentral neurones during active and passive movements in awake animals are briefly discussed.

TI  - THE PHENOMENON OF HEARING - AN INTERDISCIPLINARY DISCOURSE .1.
PY  - 1992
AB  - For the last century hearing has been considered a purely passive process. G. S. Ohm's and H. v. Helmholtz's resonance theory of hearing was widely accepted until Wien's fundamental objection led to G. v. Bekesy's and O. F. Ranke's travelling wave theory, the hydrodynamics of the inner ear that distributes the frequencies along the basilar membrane, which acts as the "first filter". Seebeck, Licklider, Schouten, and deBoer emphasized also the time domain and developed the concept of periodicity hearing and the "residue phenomenon". However, it was not until the concept of the "cochlear amplifier" and "active hearing" with energy generation during the transduction process within the ear itself was introduced that the "second filter" could be understood. Kemp's echo was the key to this revolutionary step in the theory of hearing.

TI  - THE POTENTIAL FOR REGENERATION OF ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE IN DEFECTS CREATED BY CHONDRAL SHAVING AND SUBCHONDRAL ABRASION - AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION IN RABBITS
PY  - 1991
AB  - Animal models for chondral shaving and subchondral abrasion were created to resolve the controversy about the nature of the repair tissue after these procedures and to determine the effect of continuous passive motion on the quality of the repair tissue. Chondral shaving was performed on the patella in forty adolescent rabbits, and subchondral abrasion was performed on the patella in another forty rabbits. In both procedures, a three-millimeter-diameter defect was created. After the operation, twenty animals from each group were allowed intermittent active motion; the remainder were treated by continuous passive motion for two weeks, followed by intermittent active motion. Half of the animals from each group were killed at four weeks and the other half, at twelve weeks.There was no evidence of repair tissue in the defects at either four or twelve weeks after chondral shaving, regardless of the postoperative treatment. The remaining underlying cartilage, however, had degenerated. After abrasion of subchondral bone, the defects in animals that were treated with only intermittent active motion healed at twelve weeks, although the quality of the repair tissue varied. All ten of the animals that were treated with continuous passive motion, however, had mature, hyaline-like cartilage as the predominant repair tissue at twelve weeks, compared with six of the ten animals that were treated with intermittent active motion (p < 0.05).We concluded that, in this model, partial-thickness defects created by chondral shaving do not heal; rather, the remaining underlying cartilage degenerates. Full-thickness defects created by subchondral abrasion can heal by regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage. Such healing is enhanced by continuous passive motion for two weeks postoperatively.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings in this animal study suggest that chondral shaving may be indicated for debridement of a severely fibrillated joint surface but cannot be expected to stimulate regeneration of articular cartilage and may even lead to degeneration in the remaining cartilage. After subchondral abrasion, continuous passive motion may be indicated for at least two weeks to enhance the regeneration of articular cartilage.

TI  - THE PRIMATE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS .1. FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES IN INTACT ANIMALS
PY  - 1994
AB  - 1. The present study tests several key aspects of the current model of the intrinsic circuitry of the basal ganglia, in particular the degree to which basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are functionally segregated at the level of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). To this end the responses of STN cells to somatosensory examination (n = 301 cells), the polarity and latencies of neuronal responses to passive and active movements (n = 223 cells), responses to microstimulation(n = 1589 sites), and cross-correlation functions of pairs of neighboring neurons ( n = 72 pairs) were studied in STNs of three African green monkeys.2. The activity of 55% of cells examined in STN was briskly modulated in response to passive movements of individual contralateral body parts. Of these, 86% responded to passive joint rotation of muscle palpation, but in some cases (25% of responding cells) responses were also elicited by light touch. In 91% of the responding cells responses were elicited by manipulations around a single joint only.3. The caudoventral sector in STN was largely devoid of cells with responses to somatosensory stimulation. Within the rostrodorsal zone a lateral region containing neurons that responded to arm movements and a more medial region with neurons responding to leg movement were found. Cells responding to orofacial movements were located more dorsally and rostrally. Neurons with similar responses to active and passive movements of the limbs tended to be clustered within ''arm'' and ''leg'' zones.4. Of identified arm cells in STN (n = 80), 36% responded to the application of torque pulses to the elbow (43 responses overall). Forty-eight percent of these cells responded to both extension and flexion torques. Ninety-three percent of the responses were initial increases in discharge, which characteristically occurred earlier and were shorter than initial decreases. Fifty-three percent of the responses were biphasic or multiphasic.5. During active step tracking movements 40% of STN arm cells (n = 53 cells) responded with significant changes in activity. Thirty-six percent of these cells showed responses with both extension and flexion movements. Of the responses, 90% were increases in discharge. Only 14% of all responses were biphasic or multiphasic. Responses tended to occur around the time of movement onset (average latency 2 ms after movement onset).6. Microstimulation (bipolar pulses, 40 mu A, 200-500 ms train duration, 400 Hz) of the core of STN itself did not appear to produce movement. However, stimulation at the lateral borders of STN and of the adjacent white matter often led to limb or eye movement.7. Cross-correlation analysis of simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons revealed significant synchronized activity in only 11% of pairs.8. The somatotopic arrangement of neuronal responses and the paucity of neighboring cells discharging in synchrony strongly support the concept of functional segregation in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways. The predominance of brisk increases in discharge in STN in response to movements most likely results from corticosubthalamic activation. The current model of basal ganglia anatomy predicts that this will lead to inhibition of movements. The inhibitory role of STN in motor control is further supported by the failure of electrical stimulation of the nucleus to induce movements. The late onset of responses of STN neurons in the step tracking task suggests that STN and the ''indirect'' pathway are not involved in the selection or initiation of movements, but may rather have a role in the control of ongoing movements.

TI  - THE TRAVELING WAVE IN THE HUMAN INNER EAR STUDIED BY MEANS OF A FINITE-ELEMENT MODEL INCLUDING MIDDLE AND OUTER EAR
PY  - 2016
AB  - The mammalian hearing organ is a remarkable biophysical system, which converts the incoming sound into a neural signal. The main components in the signal chain are the middle ear, the basilar membrane, and the organ of Corti. The middle ear matches the impedance of the liquid filled inner ear to the surrounding air. If a tone reaches the ear, a traveling wave builds up along the basilar membrane, which peaks at a frequency dependent location due to multiple gradients in stiffness and geometry. Atop of the basilar membrane resides the organ of Corti wherein the mechanotransduction process takes place.Here we study the mechanics of the traveling wave by a detailed three-dimensional finiteelement model. The model is based on geometry data from mu CT-scans of a human ear and the mechanical properties of the basilar membrane are adjusted to provide the known tonotopic map. Furthermore, we ensure that the orthotropic material of the basilar membrane has a compressibility similar to water. In the current version of the model we omit the organ of Corti with its various cell types but add a model of the middle ear and the ear canal filled with an acoustic fluid and attached infinite elements to represent the outer ear.This model allows us to compare different load cases and we analyzed for them forces and motions. First we studied the case of normal passive hearing by exciting our model by an oscillating pressure at the entrance of the ear canal to validate our model. In a second scenario we applied an oscillatory force locally on the basilar membrane and analyzed the pressure in the ear canal. This provides some estimate how much energy is dissipated of the active process inside the organ of Corti on the way to the outer ear canal.

TI  - THE ULTRASTRUCTURE AND PERMEABILITY FOR COLLOIDAL CARBON OF INTESTINAL SUBMUCOSAL ARTERIOLES IN RATS
PY  - 1974
AB  - The fine structure and the permeability to colloidal carbon of the intestinal submucosal arterioles measuring 60–100 microns in diameter were studied in the rat. With the methods used for fixation there were no signs of contraction. The fine structure was qualitatively similar to the arteriolar fine structure previously described in other organs and other animals. Special attention was drawn to the finding of endothelial protrusions through the internal elastic lamina, in some cases forming myoendothelial junctions. In several cases, interendothelial junctions were localized corresponding to these endothelial protrusions. The arteriolar wall was not permeable to colloidal carbon either as an active transfer or as a passive movement through the endothelium. © 1974 Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica

TI  - THE USE OF PROLONGED BLOCK OF PLEXUS AXILLARIS IN CHILDREN WITH EXTENSION CONTRACTURES OF THE ELBOWS DUE TO ARTHROGRYPOSIS
PY  - 2012
AB  - Elbow deformities is one of the most widespread pathologies in patients with arthrogryposis. In the majority of the cases children have extension contractures. Most of the children have limitation of active and passive movements in elbow. The aim of this research was to establish the efficiency of prolonged block of plexus axillaris in children with extension contractures of the elbows due to arthrogryposis. From 2010 to 2011 we performed prolonged block of plexus axillaris in 23 children with arthrogryposis after mobilization of elbow. During catheterization of perineural space we use ultrasound navigation and neurostimulation. We carry out elbow capsulotomy and V-Y triceps lengthening with (or without) transposition muscles. Prolonged block of plexus axillaris after these operation helps to improve passive movements in the elbow (the average passive flexion was 80-50°, passive extension was 170-160°). The mean time of rehabilitation was 3 weeks. Combination of this method with physiotherapy helps to restore range of motion in elbow in patients with arthrogryposis.

TI  - THIXOTROPIC CHANGES IN HUMAN MUSCLE STIFFNESS AND THE EFFECTS OF FATIGUE
PY  - 1988
AB  - Two methods have been used to study the stiffness of the relaxed finger musculature after movement followed by various times at rest. The muscles stiffen considerably as the time at rest increases. The time course of this change has been plotted; it continues at a declining rate for at least 30 min. The increased stiffness after resting can be immediately reduced by active or passive movements but not by isometric efforts. These changes characterize a thixotropic system and suggest a long‐term molecular rearrangement in relaxed muscle. Extensive eccentric exercise of the muscles under investigation reduces the overall stiffness and there is a concomitant increase in tremor on movement. © 1988 The Physiological Society

TI  - THREE-DIMENSIONAL IN-VIVO SCAPULAR KINEMATICS AND SCAPULOHUMERAL RHYTHM: A COMPARISON BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MOTION
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background This study set out to offer a three-dimensional description of scapular kinematics and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) of healthy subjects during arm elevation and lowering, as well as to compare and analyse the differences between active and passive motion of the shoulder. Methods The study examined the shoulders of ten healthy males (mean age: 23.5 years). The shoulders of the ten healthy participants were elevated and lowered while fluoroscopic images were taken, and three-dimensional bone models were created from 2D to 3D using model registration techniques. The Euler angle sequences of the models' scapular kinematics and SHR were compared during active and passive shoulder motion. Results The scapula presented three-way movements of upward rotation, posterior tilting, and external rotation during arm elevation and lowering. During arm elevation, upward rotation showed a statistically significant difference between active and passive shoulder movements (p&lt;0.05). Upward rotation between 45° and 90° showed a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05). The scapular posterior tilting from the active motion resulted in more tilting in the high-degree range of motions. Additionally, statistically significant differences were found between active and passive motion (p&lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups during external rotation. However, during arm lowering, the scapular upward rotation showed a statistically significant difference between active and passive motion (both p&lt;0.05). Conclusions In healthy subjects, scapular kinematics showed a statistically significant difference between active and passive motion during elevation in the higher range of motion, but not during lowering. In terms of upward rotation, active shoulders rotated more upward during arm elevation. There was more upward rotation in active shoulders during arm elevation. With regard to passive motion, there was more posterior tilting during arm elevation. The scapular kinematics of upward rotation and posterior tilting showed a linear rotation during arm lowering.

TI  - THU0452 Immediate and long term efficacy of anakinra in acute flares due to hydroxyapatite calcifications: a real-life experience of 13 cases
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Calcifications composed of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals can induce acute and severe pain accompanied by signs of acute inflammation. In a previous pilot study, we have shown that anakinra was effective in acute flare of calcific periarthritis of the shoulder in the short term Objectives The goal of this retrospective observational study was to confirm these results in a larger set of patients, extending the observation to other localizations and to report on the long-term follow-up. Methods All consecutive patients with an acute flare due to HA deposition and treated with anakinra between March 2011 and November 2016 were included. Flare was defined as symptoms of acute pain at rest present for &lt;10 days. None of the patients had corticosteroid therapy in the last 2 weeks, none had responded to at least 48 hours of high doses of NSAIDs or other rheumatologic diseases explaining the symptoms. Clinical evaluation consisted of patient assessment of pain by VAS (10mm scale) at days 0, 1, 3, 21 and joint mobility. CRP and ESR measurements, ultrasound and x-ray examinations were performed before the treatment and at least once again after the treatment. Anakinra 100mg daily was administered for 1 to 3 consecutive days. Other baseline demographic data and long-term follow up data were collected from the patients' charts and after phone call to the patients Results 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 12 had a flare at the shoulder, 1 at the first MCP of the hand. The acute inclusion flare was the first episode in 9/13 subjects. At baseline, mean pain VAS:8.8/10 Active and passive motion was severely restricted in all patients. Local inflammation was sufficiently severe to induce an elevation of the CRP and ESR in 10/12 patients. By ultrasound, the mean size of calcifications was 17 mm. Only one had an arc-shaped aspect with shadowing, the others were fragmented. Short term follow-up: Pain diminished drastically and rapidly, typically within hours, in most patients after the first injection and was almost absent at day three (mean VAS 1.7/10), stable at 3 weeks (mean VAS: 2.1). At follow-up ultrasound, the calcification disappeared in none of the patients but, in most cases, a reduction (50% mean size reduction) and a fragmentation was observed. Long term follow-up: The median duration was 24 months, (range 4 to 74 months). Only 2/ 12 patients experienced an acute relapse. These two patients already suffered from chronic shoulder pain and had prior flares before the treatment with anakinra. Mild chronic pain, essentially related to movement (mean VAS: 2.7), was still present in 5 patients. Two patients regularly took NSAIDs; the others did not use any painkiller Conclusions This study suggests that IL-1β inhibition may be an interesting therapeutic approach in acute flares in relation with hydroxyapatite calcification. Moreover this treatment does not seem to be associated with rebound or recurrence of flares in the long term.

TI  - TH‐C‐M100J‐08: Dosimetric Effects of a 4D Magnetic Localization System for LINAC Beam Gating On Prostate and Lung Radiation Therapy
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: The Calypso® Medical 4D Localization System is capable of tracking continuous dynamic motion, and has been FDA cleared for use in the prostate. To date, automatic intervention for the measured motion is not a function of the system. We investigated use of the system to gate radiation therapy delivery on a motion phantom for both a lung and prostate fraction Materials and Methods: A Calypso gating prototype system with an optically isolated relay was connected to the BEAM_HOLD interface of a Varian Trilogy linac. A sample 3D lung plan and SMLC prostate plan were randomly selected from the active patient list. The Washington University 4D phantom was programmed to move a film box through 2 patient‐measured prostate and lung trajectories. Radiation therapy was delivered to the static phantom, to the phantom undergoing each motion trajectory without gating, and to the phantom undergoing motion trajectories while the Calypso System was gating the linac. A 4×4×4 mm gating window centered on isocenter was used for the prostate, while a linear gating window corresponding to exhalation (ie 2 mm<y<5 mm) was used for the lung. Results: Without gating beam delivery, prostate motion during treatment delivery caused approximately 10% underdosing and overdosing due to the superior/inferior and anterior/posterior prostate motion. The Calypso System triggering gated therapy delivery reduced these areas significantly, as seen in difference images using film dosimetry. Likewise, lung tumor motion caused a geometric mismatch between static and motion delivery. The Calypso System with prototype gating showed a decrease in this mismatch. Conclusions: A wireless electromagnetic implanted transponder system for linac gating was effective in reducing dosimetric errors caused by prostate and lung motion. More work is needed to define optimal gating windows to provide maximal clinical efficiency with minimal delivery error.

TI  - TISSUE SOFTNESS EVALUATION BY MECHANICAL STYLUS SCANNING
PY  - 1994
AB  - A mechanical stylus surface analyzer (MSSA) system and the corresponding software were used to conduct standard surface analysis procedures. The MSSA instrumentation measures surface characteristics of soft bathroom tissue products. This paper describes the applicability of MSSA and how human tactile response may be modeled through characterization of surfaces. The concepts of passive and active touch as related to human perceived softness are reviewed. In particular, parameters pertinent to these kinds of tactile exploration are mentioned, as well as how they can be used to build a better model of human tactile response. A novel frequency analysis parameter called the frequency index for tactile sensitivity (FITS) is based on tissue paper surface analysis results from MSSA and provides the basis for the human response model. Included is a review of subjective human softness evaluation data for select tissues gathered to represent actual human responses. The MSSA and optical image analysis (OIA) data were collected on the same tissues, and the FITS parameter was found using MSSA. Also, MSSA data were used to reproduce an old standard parameter for evaluating tissue softness called the human tactile response (HTR) index. Since it is not possible to exactly reproduce HTR, the reproduced parameter calculated in this study is called HTR equivalent (HTR}EQ). Finally, standard deviation of luminance (SDL) and loosely bonded surface fibers (LBSF) parameters are determined for select tissues using OIA. Correlation results of the human data with FITS, HTR}EQ, SDL, and LBSF are discussed; FITS correlates best with the human response data and, together MSSA and FITS, has the ability to model human response to the softness of tissue paper products.

PY  - 1991
AB  - The efficacy of a (special) Symphytum-peregrinum ointment in the treatment of acute lateral distorsions of the ankle was studied in a comparative trial versus conventional topical cold therapy. The criteria used for the assessment of healing were pain at rest, pain on passive and active movement and local swelling. During the two week treatment period, assessment criteria improved more rapidly with Symphytum-peregrinum ointment than with topical cold therapy. The differences between the assessment parameters of the both methods of topical treatment were statistically significant.

TI  - TOUCH SENSITIVITY THROUGH LATEX EXAMINATION GLOVES
PY  - 1995
AB  - Two studies were conducted to empirically evaluate individuals' touch sensitivity while wearing latex medical-examination gloves. In Experiment I, three sensitivity threshold measures (two-point, von Frey, and thumb-index finger opposition) were used in three conditions-no glove, best-fitting glove, and ill-fitting glove. No effect of glove condition was found for the two-point measure, but significant effects were found for the von Frey and finger-opposition measures. In Experiment 2, participants attempted to sense the presence or absence of monofilament fibers of different diameters. Glove condition (no glove, best-fitting, and ill-fitting) and touch strategy (active vs. passive) were manipulated for each participant. Although there was no overall effect for glove condition, active touch proved consistently superior to passive touch.

TI  - TRAINING EFFECTS ON DYNAMIC VISUAL-ACUITY WITH FREE-HEAD VIEWING
PY  - 1991
AB  - Training effects on dynamic visual acuity (DVA) were determined over a range of target durations and target velocities under the viewing condition of free-head movement. Dynamic acuity levels were lower than static acuity levels, and training was found to be very effective in improving performance, particularly under the most difficult conditions in which performance was poorest. Improvement was also most evident among those observers who initially exhibited the poorest DVA scores. Preliminary comparisons between DVA scores of a nonselect sample of college students and those of a small group of college athletes indicated that the athletes were not very different from the nonselect group and would also benefit from training on the task.

TI  - TRAITEMENT DES RAIDEURS DU GENOU PAR LIBERATION DE L'APPAREIL EXTENSEUR
PY  - 1978
AB  - Since 1960, 450 cases of stiffness of the knee were operated on with 77 percent very good or good results. This stiffness develops: a) after a traumatic lesion of the femur or of the knee itself; b) after After an infection process arising early or after a traumatism or its surgical treatment. Whatever the reason may be, it is necessary to wait for 6 months before speaking of stiff knee and compulsory to wait for the healing of the lesion or for the complete elimination of the infection before considering a surgical operation. A knee is stiff for two reasons: a) articular (intraarticular capsular or synovial adhesions); b) extraarticular (adhesion to the neighbouring tissues and retraction of the quadriceps). The operation is divided into two stages: - The first one consists of arthrolysis, carried out by the medial approach and dividing the medial and lateral reticulum patella laterale, freeing the suprapatellar pouch. - The second one consists of disinserting the quadriceps through a postero lateral approach. This disinsertion should be complete at the level of the vastus lateralis which must also be divided at its insertion on the infratrochanteric crest, at the level of the vastus intermedius, less often at the level of the vastus medialis. The freeing of the extensor system is over when a flexion of 100 degrees or more is obtained due to the gravity of the horizontal leg (and not obtained by manually forcing the movement). Post operation rehabilitation should be undertaken as soon as the patient wakes up. The following days, postures in flexion are maintained for a period of 3 or 6 hours, followed by postures in extension of equal duration. The angle obtained should be the same as during the operation. Those alternate postures are carried out for 3 weeks, then active movements are undertaken, until active mobility equals passive mobility.

TI  - TRANS-DOCK: Expanding the interactivity of pin-based shape displays by docking mechanical transducers
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper introduces TRANS-DOCK, a docking system for pin-based shape displays that enhances their interaction capabilities for both the output and input. By simply interchanging the transducer module, composed of passive mechanical structures, to be docked on a shape display, users can selectively switch between different configurations including display sizes, resolutions, and even motion modalities to allow pins moving in a linear motion to rotate, bend and inflate. We introduce a design space consisting of several mechanical elements and enabled interaction capabilities. We then explain the implementation of the docking system and transducer design components. Our implementation includes providing the limitations and characteristics of each motion transmission method as design guidelines. A number of transducer examples are then shown to demonstrate the range of interactivity and application space achieved with the approach of TRANS-DOCK. Potential use cases to take advantage of the interchangeability of our approach are discussed. Through this paper we intend to expand expressibility, adaptability and customizability of a single shape display for dynamic physical interaction. By converting arrays of linear motion to several types of dynamic motion in an adaptable and flexible manner, we advance shape displays to enable versatile embodied interactions. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

TI  - TREATMENT OF POST-TRAUMATIC HUMERAL FRACTURES AND COMPLICATIONS USING THE OSTEOLINE() EXTERNAL FIXATOR: A TREATMENT OPTION.
PY  - 2011
AB  - UNLABELLED: To evaluate the results obtained from treatment of humeral shaft fractures and their complications using the Osteoline() uniplanar external fixator.METHODS: The radiographic and functional results from 78 patients with humeral shaft fractures treated using the uniplanar external fixation technique were retrospectively assessed. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 71 years, with a mean of 47 years. Male patients predominated (79%). Out of the 78 patients, 45 presented open fractures, 14 presented pseudarthrosis and six presented synthesis failure. There were no losses during the follow-up and all the patients were discharged after fracture consolidation and functional recovery. The results were evaluated based on the studies by Catagni, as good, fair or poor.RESULTS: Fracture consolidation was observed in 98% of the cases treated with uniplanar external fixation. Only one pseudarthrosis case required conversion to rigid internal fixation and autologous bone grafting. At the end of the treatment, all the patients were discharged with consolidated fractures, without pain, and good limb function.CONCLUSION: The external fixation described in this paper was shown to be an efficient and safe method for treating humeral shaft fractures and their complications. It preserved the local biological status and enabled passive and active movement immediately after surgery.

TI  - TRPA1 Ion Channel Determines Beneficial and Detrimental Effects of GYY4137 in Murine Serum-Transfer Arthritis
PY  - 2019
AB  - Modulation of nociception and inflammation by sulfide in rheumatoid arthritis and activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) ion channels by sulfide compounds are well documented. The present study aims to investigate TRPA1-mediated effects of sulfide donor GYY4137 in K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis, a rodent model of rheumatoid arthritis. TRPA1 and somatostatin sst4 receptor wild-type (WT) and knockout mice underwent K/BxN serum transfer and were treated daily with GYY4137. Functional and biochemical signs of inflammation were recorded, together with histological characterization. These included detection of hind paw mechanical hyperalgesia by dynamic plantar esthesiometry, hind paw volume by plethysmometry, and upside-down hanging time to failure. Hind paw erythema, edema, and passive movement range of tibiotarsal joints were scored. Somatostatin release from sensory nerve endings of TRPA1 wild-type and knockout mice in response to polysulfide was detected by radioimmunoassay. Polysulfide formation from GYY4137 was uncovered by cold cyanolysis. GYY4137 aggravated mechanical hyperalgesia in TRPA1 knockout mice but ameliorated it in wild-type ones. Arthritis score was lowered by GYY4137 in TRPA1 wild-type animals. Increased myeloperoxidase activity, plasma extravasation, and subcutaneous MIP-2 levels of hind paws were detected in TRPA1 knockout mice upon GYY4137 treatment. Genetic lack of sst4 receptors did not alter mechanical hyperalgesia, edema formation, hanging performance, arthritis score, plasma extravasation, or myeloperoxidase activity. TRPA1 WT animals exhibited smaller cartilage destruction upon GYY4137 administration. Sodium polysulfide caused TRPA1-dependent somatostatin release from murine nerve endings. Sulfide released from GYY4137 is readily converted into polysulfide by hypochlorite. Polysulfide potently activates human TRPA1 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. According to our data, the protective effect of GYY4137 is mediated by TRPA1, while detrimental actions are independent of the ion channel in the K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis model in mice. At acidic pH in inflamed tissue sulfide is released from GYY4137 and reacts with neutrophil-derived hypochlorite. Resulting polysulfide might be responsible for TRPA1 -mediated antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory as well as TRPA1 -independent pro-inflammatory effects.

TI  - TU‐FF‐A4‐06: Dynamic Accuracy of An Implanted Wireless AC Electromagnetic Sensor for Guided Radiation Therapy; Implications for Real‐Time Tumor Position Tracking
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: A wireless tumor localization and tracking system using three implanted AC electromagnetic transponders is in clinical trials for use in prostate cancer (Calypso® Medical). Phantom‐based studies have shown sub‐millimeter spatial localization accuracy in static tests. Accuracy has not been evaluated for dynamic motion found in lung tumors. This study was designed to determine the feasibility of using this patient positioning system for real‐time tumor‐tracking. Materials and Methods: A 4‐dimensional (4D) stage capable of arbitrary multidimensional motion with speeds up to 10 cm/sec was constructed. Two elliptical trajectory paths were created with peak‐to‐peak motion of 1cm × 2cm × 1cm and 2cm × 4cm × 2cm in the x, y and z directions. Each trajectory was operated with periods of 15 – 20 cycles per minute. The Calypso System was operated using one and two transponders with radiofrequency signal integration times of 33 ms 100 ms. The transponders were mounted on the 4D‐stage, with the ellipse centroids positioned 14 cm from the array. The effects of ellipse size, speed, number of transponders and signal integration time on transponder localization accuracy were evaluated by comparing the intended and measured trajectories. Results: The root mean square (RMS) position difference was less than 1 mm for all tested combinations. While small, the RMS error was largest for the large ellipse at 20 cycles per minute compared with the small ellipse at 15 cycles per minute. The single‐transponder system with 67 ms integration time had the smallest overall error, with a maximum single‐point error of 1.3mm. Conclusions Use of a wireless electromagnetic implanted transponder system for real‐time tumor‐tracking is feasible, with RMS errors less than 1mm for high‐speed multidimensional ellipses. This compares favorably with continuous fluoroscopic tracking methods without an ionizing radiation burden. This work is currently being expanded to patient‐derived tumor trajectories. © 2005, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - TWINLINE ARRAY DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE IN A SHALLOW-WATER LITTORAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 1995
AB  - A towed two-line passive acoustic sensor with a horizontal aperture has demonstrated improved detection, noise performance, and reverberation rejection during recent at-sea testing and is thus an effective alternative to single-line array systems, particularly in a shallow-water environment, This recently developed sensor, referred to as the Twinline array, consists of two line arrays separated in the horizontal plane, a towing subsystem, and a shipboard processing suite. Towing characteristics and acoustic and detection performance were assessed in 1994 during three at-sea tests. The tests disclosed median noise gains of 25 dB or more over wide frequency bands and backlobe rejection ratios of up to 40 dB. Reverberation measurements with explosive sources revealed left-right rejection ratios exceeding 20 dB. Continued sea testing in 1995 will further manifest Twinline's effectiveness to the Fleet in passive and active scenarios.

AB  - Most of my readers will have observed a small water-insect on the surface of rivulets, which throws a cinque-spotted shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook; and will have noticed, how the little animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a momentary fulcrum for a further propulsion. (192) Here the primary sense of 'meat' is the older, neutral sense of 'food', but, if assume that we are dealing with Apatura iris, a further layer of meaning is activated by that butterfly's preference for carrion-a preference unique among British species: The Purple Emperor is a magnificent and elusive insect that is actively sought out by the many subjects of "Elis Majesty", as the male butterfly is affectionately known.

TI  - TacWhiskers: Biomimetic optical tactile whiskered robots
PY  - 2018
AB  - Here we propose and investigate a novel vibrissal tactile sensor - the TacWhisker array - based on modifying a 3D-printed optical cutaneous (fingertip) tactile sensor - the TacTip. Two versions are considered: a static TacWhisker array analogous to immotile tactile vibrissae (e.g. rodent microvibrissae) and a dynamic TacWhisker array analogous to motile tactile vibrissae (e.g. rodent macrovibrissae). Performance is assessed on an active object localization task. The whisking motion of the dynamic TacWhisker leads to millimetre-scale location perception, whereas perception with the static TacWhisker array is relatively poor when making dabbing contacts. The dynamic sensor output is dominated by a self-generated motion signal, which can be compensated by comparing to a reference signal. Overall, the TacWhisker arrays give a new class of tactile whiskered robots that benefit from being relatively inexpensive and customizable. Furthermore, the biomimetic basis for the TacWhiskers fits well with building an embodied model of the rodent sensory system for investigating animal perception.

TI  - Tactile Acuity Charts: A Reliable Measure of Spatial Acuity
PY  - 2014
AB  - For assessing tactile spatial resolution it has recently been recommended to use tactile acuity charts which follow the design principles of the Snellen letter charts for visual acuity and involve active touch. However, it is currently unknown whether acuity thresholds obtained with this newly developed psychophysical procedure are in accordance with established measures of tactile acuity that involve passive contact with fixed duration and control of contact force. Here we directly compared tactile acuity thresholds obtained with the acuity charts to traditional two-point and grating orientation thresholds in a group of young healthy adults. For this purpose, two types of charts, using either Braille-like dot patterns or embossed Landolt rings with different orientations, were adapted from previous studies. Measurements with the two types of charts were equivalent, but generally more reliable with the dot pattern chart. A comparison with the two-point and grating orientation task data showed that the test-retest reliability of the acuity chart measurements after one week was superior to that of the passive methods. Individual thresholds obtained with the acuity charts agreed reasonably with the grating orientation threshold, but less so with the two-point threshold that yielded relatively distinct acuity estimates compared to the other methods. This potentially considerable amount of mismatch between different measures of tactile acuity suggests that tactile spatial resolution is a complex entity that should ideally be measured with different methods in parallel. The simple test procedure and high reliability of the acuity charts makes them a promising complement and alternative to the traditional two-point and grating orientation thresholds.

TI  - Tactile Motion and Pattern Processing Assessed with High-Field fMRI
PY  - 2011
AB  - Processing of motion and pattern has been extensively studied in the visual domain, but much less in the somatosensory system. Here, we used ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7 Tesla to investigate the neuronal correlates of tactile motion and pattern processing in humans under tightly controlled stimulation conditions. Different types of dynamic stimuli created the sensation of moving or stationary bar patterns during passive touch. Activity in somatosensory cortex was increased during both motion and pattern processing and modulated by motion directionality in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII) as well as by pattern orientation in the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Furthermore, tactile motion and pattern processing induced activity in the middle temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) and in the inferior parietal cortex (IPC), involving parts of the supramarginal und angular gyri. These responses covaried with subjects' individual perceptual performance, suggesting that hMT+/V5 and IPC contribute to conscious perception of specific tactile stimulus features. In addition, an analysis of effective connectivity using psychophysiological interactions (PPI) revealed increased functional coupling between SI and hMT+/V5 during motion processing, as well as between SI and IPC during pattern processing. This connectivity pattern provides evidence for the direct engagement of these specialized cortical areas in tactile processing during somesthesis.

TI  - Tactile Perception for Stroke Induce Changes in Electroencephalography
PY  - 2016
AB  - Objective/Background: Tactile perception is a basic way to obtain and evaluate information about an object. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of tactile perception on brain activation using two different tactile explorations, passive and active touches, in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke.Methods: Twenty patients who were diagnosed with stroke (8 right brain damaged, 12 left brain damaged) participated in this study. The tactile perception was conducted using passive and active explorations in a sitting position. To determine the neurological changes in the brain, this study measured the brain waves of the participants using electroencephalography (EEG).Results: The relative power of the sensory motor rhythm on the right prefrontal lobe and right parietal lobe was significantly greater during the active tactile exploration compared to the relative power during the passive exploration in the left damaged hemisphere. Most of the measured brain areas showed nonsignificantly higher relative power of the sensory motor rhythm during the active tactile exploration, regardless of which hemisphere was damaged.Conclusion: The results of this study provided a neurophysiological evidence on tactile perception in individuals with chronic stroke. Occupational therapists should consider an active tactile exploration as a useful modality on occupational performance in rehabilitation training.

TI  - Tactile Taps Teach Rhythmic Text Entry: Passive Haptic Learning of Morse Code
PY  - 2016
AB  - Passive Haptic Learning (PHL) is the acquisition of sensorimotor skills with little or no active attention to learning. This technique is facilitated by wearable computing, and applications are diverse. However, it is not known whether rhythm based information can be conveyed passively. In a 12 participant study, we investigate whether Morse code, a rhythm based text entry system, can he learned through PHL using the hone conduction transducer on Google Glass. After four hours of exposure to passive stimuli while focusing their attention on a distraction task, PHL participants achieved a 94% accuracy rate keying a pangram (a phrase with all the letters of the alphabet) using Morse code on Glass's trackpad versus 53% for the control group. Most PHL participants achieved 100% accuracy before the end of the study. In written tests, PIIL participants could write the codes for each letter of the alphabet with 98% accuracy versus 59% for control. When perceiving Morse code, PHL participants also performed significantly better than control: 83% versus 46% accuracy.

TI  - Tactile activity in primate primary somatosensory cortex during active arm movements: Correlation with receptive field properties
PY  - 1994
AB  - 1. Five hundred ninety-five single neurons with tactile receptive fields (RFs) on the contralateral arm were isolated in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of awake, behaving monkeys. 2. Fifty-eight percent of the tactile cells showed significantly different levels of activity during active movements of the arm in eight directions or during active maintenance of the arm over the target endpoints. 3. The discharge of many of the active tactile cells was unimodally tuned with movement direction and the pattern of the tactile population activity varied in a meaningful fashion with arm movement direction and posture. 4. The intensity of the arm-movement-induced activity was typically less than that evoked by direct tactile stimulation of the cell's RF. 5. The probability of task-related activity was correlated with certain RF properties, in particular the sensitivity of the cell to lateral stretch of the skin and to passive arm movements that avoided direct contact of the RF on any surface. 6. This suggests that task-related activity results mainly from the activation of tactile receptors by mechanical deformation of the skin as the arm changes geometry during movement. 7. These results demonstrate that tactile activity containing potential proprioceptive information is generated in SI during active arm movements that avoid direct contact of the skin with external surfaces. Whether or not this input contributes to the kinesthetic sensations evoked by the movements cannot be resolved by this study.

TI  - Tactile allodynia in patients with lumbar radicular pain (sciatica)
PY  - 2014
AB  - We report a novel symptom in many patients with low back pain (LBP) that sheds new light on the underlying pain mechanism. By means of quantitative sensory testing, we compared patients with radicular LBP (sciatica), axial LBP (LBP without radiation into the leg), and healthy controls, searching for cutaneous allodynia in response to weak tactile and cooling stimuli on the leg and low back. Most patients with radicular pain (∼60%) reported static and dynamic tactile allodynia, as well as cooling allodynia, on the leg, often extending into the foot. Some also reported allodynia on the low back. In axial LBP, allodynia was almost exclusively on the back. The degree of dynamic tactile allodynia correlated with the degree of background pain. The presence of allodynia suggests that the peripheral nerve generators of background leg and back pain have also induced central sensitization. The distal (foot) location of the allodynia in patients who have it indicates that the nociceptive drive that maintains the central sensitization arises paraspinally (ectopically) in injured ventral ramus afferents; this is not an instance of somatic referred pain. The presence of central sensitization also provides the first cogent account of shooting pain in sciatica as a wave of activity sweeping vectorially across the width of the sensitized dorsal horn. Finally, the results endorse leg allodynia as a pain biomarker in animal research on LBP, which is commonly used but has not been previously validated. In addition to informing the underlying mechanism of LBP, bedside mapping of allodynia might have practical implications for prognosis and treatment.

TI  - Tactile discrimination of textured surfaces: psychophysical performance measurements in humans.
PY  - 1983
AB  - Psychophysical experiments were designed to assess the tactile discriminative abilities of human subjects when touching textured surfaces. Plastic strips were produced which had raised dots in a square arrangement (standard surface) or in one of a number of rectangular arrangements (modified surfaces) in which the spacing of the dots differed from the standard surface by some constant amount in one direction. Subjects were presented with pairs of surfaces and asked to discriminate whether each pair consisted of (a), two identical standard surfaces, or (b), a standard surface and a modified surface. Performance measurements were analysed using decision theory. When subjects moved their fingers over the surfaces (active touch) their responses were virtually unbiased, and there was a linear relationship between discriminative performance and the difference between the spacing of the dots on the two surfaces. At the 75% correct level, subjects could distinguish surfaces in which the period of the dots differed by only 2%. Performance was virtually independent of the method of movement used, despite large differences in the velocity profiles of the various movements. Experiments in which the surfaces were moved under the subject's stationary finger (passive touch) displayed the same linear relationship between performance and period difference as in the active‐touch experiments. Furthermore, the discriminative performance levels were very similar in the two types of experiments. In the passive‐touch experiments, subjects could distinguish smaller differences in period in the surface dimension parallel to (along) the direction of movement than they could distinguish in the dimension perpendicular to (across) the direction of movement. The hypothesis is advanced that normal active discrimination of surfaces is made possible by using similar movements in successive surface contacts and a relatively simple neural code. © 1983 The Physiological Society

TI  - Tactile display with dielectric multilayer elastomer actuators
PY  - 2009
AB  - Tactile perception is the human sensation of surface textures through the vibrations generated by stroking a finger over the surface. The skin responds to several distributed physical quantities. Perhaps the most important are high-frequency vibrations, pressure distributions (static shape) and thermal properties. The integration of tactile displays in man-machine interfaces promises a more intuitive handling. For this reason many tactile displays are developed using different technologies. We present several state-of-the-art tactile displays based on different types of dielectric elastomer actuators to clarify the advantages of our matrix display based on multilayer technology. Using this technology perpendicular and hexagonal arrays of actuator elements (tactile stimulators) can be integrated into a PDMS substrate. Element diameters down to 1 mm allow stimuli at the range of the human two-point-discrimination threshold. Driving the elements by column and row addressing enables various stimulation patterns with a reduced number of feeding lines. The transient analysis determines charging times of the capacitive actuators depending on actuator geometry and material parameters. This is very important to ensure an adequate dynamic characteristic of the actuators to stimulate the human skin by vibrations. The suitability of multilayer dielectric elastomer actuators for actuation in tactile displays has been determined. Beside the realization of a static tactile display - where multilayer DEA are integrated as drives for movable contact pins - we focus on the direct use of DEA as a vibrotactile display. Finally, we present the scenario and achieved results of a recognition threshold test. Even relative low voltages in the range of 800 V generate vibrations with 100% recognition ratio within the group of participants. Furthermore, the frequency dependent characteristic of the determined recognition threshold confirms with established literature. © 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Tactile exploration of virtual objects for blind and sighted people: the role of beta 1 EEG band in sensory substitution and supramodal mental mapping
PY  - 2012
AB  - Campus C, Brayda L, De Carli F, Chellali R, Fama F, Bruzzo C, Lucagrossi L, Rodriguez G. Tactile exploration of virtual objects for blind and sighted people: the role of beta 1 EEG band in sensory substitution and supramodal mental mapping. J Neurophysiol 107: 2713-2729, 2012. First published February 15, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00624.2011.-The neural correlates of exploration and cognitive mapping in blindness remain elusive. The role of visuo-spatial pathways in blind vs. sighted subjects is still under debate. In this preliminary study, we investigate, as a possible estimation of the activity in the visuo-spatial pathways, the EEG patterns of blind and blindfolded-sighted subjects during the active tactile construction of cognitive maps from virtual objects compared with rest and passive tactile stimulation. Ten blind and ten matched, blindfolded-sighted subjects participated in the study. Events were defined as moments when the finger was only stimulated (passive stimulation) or the contour of a virtual object was touched (during active exploration). Event-related spectral power and coherence perturbations were evaluated within the beta 1 band (14-18 Hz). They were then related to a subjective cognitive-load estimation required by the explorations [namely, perceived levels of difficulty (PLD)]. We found complementary cues for sensory substitution and spatial processing in both groups: both blind and sighted subjects showed, while exploring, late power decreases and early power increases, potentially associated with motor programming and touch, respectively. The latter involved occipital areas only for blind subjects (long-term plasticity) and only during active exploration, thus supporting tactile-to-visual sensory substitution. In both groups, coherences emerged among the fronto-central, centro-parietal, and occipito-temporal derivations associated with visuo-spatial processing. This seems in accordance with mental map construction involving spatial processing, sensory-motor processing, and working memory. The observed involvement of the occipital regions suggests that a substitution process also occurs in sighted subjects. Only during explorations did coherence correlate positively with PLD for both groups and in derivations, which can be related to visuo-spatial processing, supporting the existence of supramodal spatial processing independently of vision capabilities.

TI  - Tactile feel display for virtual active touch
PY  - 2003
AB  - In order to display delicate touch feeling of surface of some materials, active touch of human hand movements should be considered. In this paper, a wearable stimulation device that can produce various distributed stimuli on human skin in response to hand movements was developed using ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer gel Film) actuators. Characteristics of touch feel of roughness were measured using vibratory stimulation. The results showed that the threshold amplitude under active touch were smaller than under passive touch. A stimulation method which generate selective stimuli to sense receptors in accordance with velocities and accelerations of hand motions was proposed. It was confirmed experimentally that some kinds of pattern of driving waves express touch feels in response to hand movements.

TI  - Tactile information processing in primate hand somatosensory cortex (S1) during passive arm movement
PY  - 2013
AB  - Motor output mostly depends on sensory input, which also can be affected by action. To further our understanding of how tactile information is processed in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in dynamic environments, we recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation of the hand in three awake monkeys under arm/hand passive movement and rest. We found that neurons generally responded to tactile stimulation under both conditions and were modulated by movement: with a higher baseline firing rate, a suppressed peak rate, and a smaller dynamic range during passive movement than during rest, while the area under the response curve was stable across these two states. By using an information theory-based method, the mutual information between tactile stimulation and neural responses was quantified with rate and spatial coding models under the two conditions. The two potential encoding models showed different contributions depending on behavioral contexts. Tactile information encoded with rate coding from individual units was lower than spatial coding of unit pairs, especially during movement; however, spatial coding had redundant information between unit pairs. Passive movement regulated the mutual information, and such regulation might play different roles depending on the encoding strategies used. The underlying mechanisms of our observation most likely come from a bottom-up strategy, where neurons in S1 were regulated through the activation of the peripheral tactile/proprioceptive receptors and the interactions between these different types of information.

TI  - Tactile localization of the direction and distance of sounds
PY  - 1979
AB  - In a previous paper, experiments were reported which demonstrated that human subjects can judge accurately the azimuthal direction of sounds using a tactile localization device. It was also demonstrated that a tactile analogue of selective auditory attention was possible with this system. Three additional experiments, reported here, indicate that subjects are also able to judge the distance of the sound source and can concurrently judge both the azimuthal direction and distance of a source. Comparisons were made between conditions where head movements were permitted lactive~ and conditions where the head was held still Ipassive, and between normal auditory judgments and tactile judgments. Active tactile performance was essentially similar to auditory performance. Active performance was superior to passive in both directional and distance judgment, but different components of the motor-sensory complex were found to contribute to active superiority in the two tasks. The implication of these experiments for the design of auditory prosthetic devices is discussed. © 1979 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

TI  - Tactile motion biases visual motion perception in binocular rivalry
PY  - 2019
AB  - There is an ongoing debate whether or not multisensory interactions require awareness of the sensory signals. Static visual and tactile stimuli have been shown to influence each other even in the absence of visual awareness. However, it is unclear if this finding generalizes to dynamic contexts. In the present study, we presented visual and tactile motion stimuli and induced fluctuations of visual awareness by means of binocular rivalry: two gratings which drifted in opposite directions were displayed, one to each eye. One visual motion stimulus dominated and reached awareness while the other visual stimulus was suppressed from awareness. Tactile motion stimuli were presented at random time points during the visual stimulation. The motion direction of a tactile stimulus always matched the direction of one of the concurrently presented visual stimuli. The visual gratings were differently tinted, and participants reported the color of the currently seen stimulus. Tactile motion delayed perceptual switches that ended dominance periods of congruently moving visual stimuli compared to switches during visual-only stimulation. In addition, tactile motion fostered the return to dominance of suppressed, congruently moving visual stimuli, but only if the tactile motion started at a late stage of the ongoing visual suppression period. At later stages, perceptual suppression is typically decreasing. These results suggest that visual awareness facilitates but does not gate multisensory interactions between visual and tactile motion signals.

TI  - Tactile pattern delivery device to investigate cognitive mechanisms for early detection of Alzheimer's disease
PY  - 2011
AB  - The cognitive symptoms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) involve problems with learning, memory or planning. Currently, no medical tests are available to conclusively diagnose dementia pre-mortem. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cognitive deficits of AD can be detected during a preclinical period with neuropsychological tests. This chapter's hypothesis is that cognitive deficit symptoms of AD are detectable using a combination of tactile, kinetic, cognitive, and functional MRI tasks in the earliest stages of the disease. The authors of this chapter offer a novel approach to investigate the early detection of AD with tactile procedures. This chapter introduces the development of two tactile pattern delivery devices. The first delivery device is MRI-compatible and can serve to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of active and passive tactile pattern discrimination. The second delivery device is designed to investigate the characteristics of passive shape discrimination for psychological experiments. These devices may contribute to the early detection of AD with neuropsychological approaches. The ultimate goal of this research was to confirm the human ability of tactile shape discrimination and determine the differences between age-matched healthy individuals and AD patients. © 2011, IGI Global.

TI  - Tactile responses in the granule cell layer of cerebellar folium Crus IIa of freely behaving rats
PY  - 2001
AB  - We recorded activity from the granule cell layer (GCL) of cerebellar folium Crus IIa as freely moving rats engaged in a variety of natural behaviors, including grooming, eating, and free tactile exploration. Multiunit responses in the 1000- 4500 Hz range were found to be strongly correlated with tactile stimulation of lip and whisker (perioral) regions. These responses occurred regardless of whether the stimulus was externally or self-generated and during both active and passive touch. In contrast, perioral movements that did not tactually stimulate this region of the face (e. g., chewing) produced no detectable increases in GCL activity. In addition, GCL responses were not correlated with movement extremes. When rats used their lips actively for palpation and exploration, the tactile responses in the GCL were not detectably modulated by ongoing jaw movements. However, active palpation and exploratory behaviors did result in the largest and most continuous bursts of GCL activity: responses were on average 10% larger and 50% longer during palpation and exploration than during grooming or passive stimulation. Although activity levels differed between behaviors, the position and spatial extent of the peripheral receptive field was similar over all behaviors that resulted in tactile input. Overall, our data suggest that the 1000- 4500 Hz multiunit responses in the Crus IIa GCL of awake rats are correlated with tactile input rather than with movement or any movement parameter and that these responses are likely to be of particular importance during the acquisition of sensory information by perioral structures.

TI  - Tactile sensation with high-density pin-matrix
PY  - 2005
AB  - The goal of this research is to investigate the sensation produced with ultimate dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display. It has been a lot of research for tactile display which has many pin-rods moving only in the vertical direction. These systems are typically divided into two types; one type is designed for presenting static shape (such as geometrical or geographical features, characters or icons on the computer screen, etc.) and another type is for displaying patterns changing dynamically. The advantage of passive type is that we can explore the presented texture at our own paces. On the other hand, an advantage of dynamic type is that it can provide richer information than static displays with small presenting area; that is because we need only put our fingers on the top of the display and feel tactile patterns changing automatically. We think this advantage will be important for applying tactile display to usual computer interface or cell phone. Although some previous studies proposed dynamic tactile display with various actuators, these prototypes had their disadvantages such as low response time or low density of pin matrix, and so on. Therefore, it is thought that these tactile displays are still in the early stage. However, we haven't well understood what kind of sensation can be presented with dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display yet. We think that it is not necessarily appropriate approach to evaluate this type of displays after developing them. We believe that we need a novel methodology to design or evaluate dynamic pin-matrix tactile displays before creating them. To investigate the tactile sensation with a high-density Pin-Matrix (PM) type tactile interface, we generated dynamic movement of a non-actuated prototype by moving it over textures etched onto a flat surface. With this method, a human works as a part of actuator, therefore it is unnecessary to add actuator for each pin-rod. Figure 1 shows three types of pin-matrix we created; PM1 has the smallest interval 1.0mm from center to center of the pin-rod, PM2 has 1.5mm pin interval which is approximately as same as the two-point threshold on the fingertip, and PM3 has 2.0mm interval. We made supporting plates with thin bakelite board (thickness: 1.0mm), which has 0.9mm holes for penetrating pin-rods. The bottom of the pin-rod has 0.4mm hemisphere shape, which enables to reduce the effect of the friction dramatically and to go over the texture without tumbling. With this specification, PM can move freely corresponding to the texture surface. We also took the length of spaces placed between two bakelite boards into account in order to keep the movement direction of pin-rods only in the vertical. To investigate how small interval is enough for human to recognize the shapes engraved on the texture, we conducted a psychophysical experiment with touching textures using these PMs. The result showed that the smaller the pin interval becomes, the easier subjects understood what shape was engraved on the textures. In another experiment, we asked subject that the engraved texture is convex or concave. Subjects could easily tell convex from concave, therefore this result might suggest that not only the tangential force but also normal force on finger tip is used for shape recognition. And we also found a kind of edge enhancement effect in using PM, especially in small pin interval. We think this effect might result from an aliasing effect as mentioned in previous study [Kikuuwe et al. 2005], which is caused by discrete sampling of the target texture. We think that our devised method can be broadly used for deciding parameters of pin-matrix type tactile displays for particular application. In our preliminary result we confirmed that subject could easily recognize the shape with 1.0mm interval pin-matrix. Although we need to perform further experiment with smaller pin-rod or smaller pin interval, we can say that current, dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display is not sufficient enough for displaying shapes to finger tip. With the same methodology we proposed, it will be possible to find which pin interval is the most appropriate for a dynamic Braille or a computer interface.

TI  - Tactile sensing system with wrinkle's morphological change: Modeling
PY  - 2018
AB  - Previously, we have developed an active tactile sensing system that can select sensing modalities based on specific sensing tasks by changing its morphology, named Wrin'Tac. This tactile sensing system is constructed by an integration of actuation (pneumatic actuator) and sensing elements (strain gauge) inside a thin, multi-layered substrate. Under pressurization, the morphology of the substrate surface changes with the appearances of wrinkle. As a result, this device can detect both static load under indentation and dynamic sliding action by using only a single type of sensing element (strain gauge). In this paper, we present a computational model for estimation of the wrinkle's morphology and prediction of output of embedded sensing elements. The shape of the wrinkle and the posture of the sensing element are evaluated by calculating the height of the wrinkle. The wrinkle's mechanical change is assessed by ascertaining the stiffness of the wrinkle under vertical indentation by a spherical indenter. The output voltages of the sensor are calculated by the proposed model and the experimental values have an error of less than 10%, which validates the accuracy of the proposed model. We also pointed out the role of the wrinkle's morphology to the sensor's sensitivity, implying that this sensing system may select suitable sensitivity for specific sensation tasks. This work is expected to pave a way for assessing the role of morphological change to tactile sensation, and development of soft active tactile sensing systems. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Tactile sensory analysis for robotic applications
PY  - 1990
AB  - In this paper we discuss the role of tactile sensors in robotic manipulatory systems and present a number of techniques useful in processing tactile information acquired using passive as well as active sensing modes. Successful adaptation of touch in robotic manipulatory systems entails in both enhancing the tactile sensor technology, and developing techniques for efficient and accurate analysis of the tactile information. This paper attempts to emphasize the importance of adopting active tactile sensing scheme as against restricting to passive tactile sensing scheme. In an endeavor to demonstrate the utility of tactual perception for robotic systems, several experiments were carried out on tactile images of objects smaller as well as larger than the sensor size. The experimental results bring out the advantages of employing passive and active tactile sensing techniques to accomplish robotic manipulatory tasks. Further, based on the experimental results it becomes quite apparent that the use of Fourier descriptors over the use of complex moment invariants as shape descriptors is more advantageous for object recognition tasks using passively acquired images. A new least-square cross-correlation technique for generating composite images acquired through active exploration of objects larger than the sensor is also proposed. The implementation results clearly show that an ad hoc technique for generating composite images introduces more error than the technique proposed in this paper.

TI  - Tactile sensory system: encoding from the periphery to the cortex
PY  - 2014
AB  - Specialized mechanoreceptors in the skin respond to mechanical deformation and provide the primary input to the tactile sensory system. Although the morphology of these receptors has been documented, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the relation between cutaneous receptor morphology and the associated physiological responses to stimulation. Labelled-line models of somatosensory processes in which specific mechanoreceptors are associated with particular sensory qualities fail to account for the evidence showing that all types of tactile afferent units respond to a varying extent to most types of natural stimuli. Neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments have provided the framework for determining the relation between peripheral afferent or cortical activity and tactile perception. Neural codes derived from these afferent signals are evaluated in terms of their capacity to predict human perceptual performance. One particular challenge in developing models of the tactile sensory system is the dual use of sensory signals from the skin. In addition to their perceptual function they serve as inputs to the sensorimotor control system involved in manipulation. Perceptions generated through active touch differ from those resulting from passive stimulation of the skin because they are the product of self-generated exploratory processes. Recent research in this area has highlighted the importance of shear forces in these exploratory movements and has shown that fingertip skin is particularly sensitive to shear generated during both object manipulation and tactile exploration.

TI  - Tactile suppression and visual attention: Effects on tactile discrimination performance
PY  - 2006
AB  - The aim was to investigate tactile discrimination performance under various active and passive conditions and explore the influence of visual information. Participants had to discriminate the direction of lateral pin strokes on their fingertip under three conditions. In one condition (static) only tactile stimulation was provided. In a second condition (active) the shear force device was mounted on a kinesthetic feedback device so that tactile stimulation was accompanied by active arm movements. In a third condition (passive) the arm was moved passively using the kinesthetic device while subjects performed the discrimination task. In this first experiment vision was not controlled. Therefore, to investigate the influence of vision on tactile discrimination performance participants had to perform the tactile discrimination task in the active condition with either direct gaze on their hand, gaze on a live image of their hand or without sight of their hand. Results show that tactile discriminatio n performance was higher in the static compared to the active condition. Moreover, participants performed better when they were gazing on their hand compared to the no-sight condition. We conclude that active movement impairs tactile discrimination performance. However visual spatial attention can compensate to some degree for this loss of tactile sensibility.

TI  - Tactile/kinesthetic stimulation effects on preterm neonates
PY  - 1986
AB  - Tactile/kinesthetic stimulation was given to 20 preterm neonates (mean gestational age, 31 weeks; mean birth weight, 1,280 g; mean time in neonatal intensive care unit, 20 days) during transitional ('grower') nursery care, and their growth, sleep-wake behavior, and Brazelton scale performance was compared with a group of 20 control neonates. The tactile/kinesthetic stimulation consisted of body stroking and passive movements of the limbs for three, 15-minute periods per day for 10 days. The stimulated neonates averaged a 47% greater weight gain per day (mean 25 g v 17 g), were more active and alert during sleep/wake behavior observations, and showed more mature habituation, orientation, motor, and range of state behavior on the Brazelton scale than control infants. Finally, their hospital stay was 6 days shorter, yielding a cost savings of approximately $3,000 per infant. These data suggest that tactile/kinesthetic stimulation may be a cost effective way of facilitating growth and behavioral organization even in very small preterm neonates.

TI  - Tactile/proprioceptive integration during arm localization is intact in individuals with Parkinson's disease
PY  - 2010
AB  - It has been theorized that sensorimotor processing deficits underlie Parkinson's disease (PD) motor impairments including movement under proprioceptive control. However, it is possible that these sensorimotor processing deficits exclude tactile/proprioception sensorimotor integration: prior studies show improved movement accuracy in PD with endpoint tactile feedback, and good control in tactile-driven precision-grip tasks. To determine whether tactile/proprioceptive integration in particular is affected by PD, nine subjects with PD, (off-medication, UPDRS motor = 19-42) performed an arm-matching task. without visual feedback. In some trials one arm touched a static tactile cue that conflicted with dynamic proprioceptive feedback from biceps brachii muscle vibration. This sensory conflict paradigm has characterized tactile/proprioceptive integration in healthy subjects as specific to the context of tactile cue mobility assumptions and the intention to move the arm. We found that the individuals with PD had poorer arm-matching acuracy than age-matched control subjects. However, PD-group accuracy improved with tactile feedback. Furthermore, sensory conflict conditions were resolved in the same context-dependent fashion by both subject groups. We conclude that the somatosensory integration mechanism for prioritizing tactile and proprioception feedback in this task are not disrupted by PD, and are not related to the observed proprioceptive deficits.

TI  - Tactual discrimination of softness: abilities and mechanisms
PY  - 1996
AB  - 1. We investigated the ability of humans to tactually discriminate the softness of objects, using novel elastic objects with deformable and rigid surfaces. For objects with deformable surfaces, we cast transparent rubber specimens with variable compliances. For objects with rigid surfaces ("spring cells") we fabricated telescoping hollow cylinders with the inner cylinder supported by several springs. To measure the human discriminability and to isolate the associated information-processing mechanisms, we performed psychophysical experiments under three conditions: 1) active touch with the normal finger, where both tactile and kinesthetic information was available to the subject: 2) active touch with local cutaneous anesthesia, so that only kinesthetic information was available; and 3) passive touch, where a computer-controlled mechanical stimulator brought down the compliant specimens onto the passive fingerpad of the subject, who therefore had only tactile information. 2. We first characterized the mechanical behavior of the human fingerpad and the test objects by determining the relationship between the depth and force of indentation during constant-velocity indentations by a rigid probe. The fingerpad exhibited a pronounced nonlinear behavior in the indentation depth versus force trace such that compliance, as indicated by the local slope of the trace, decreased with increases in indentation depth. The traces for all the rubber specimens were approximately linear, indicating a constant but distinct value of compliance for each specimen. The fingerpad was more compliant than each of the rubber specimens. 3. All the human subjects showed excellent softness discriminability in ranking the rubber specimens by active touch, and the subjective perception of softness correlated one-to-one with the objectively measured compliance. The ability of subjects to discriminate the compliance of spring cells was consistently poorer compared with that of the rubber specimens. 4. For pairwise discrimination of a selected set of rubber specimens, kinesthetic information alone was insufficient. However, tactile information alone was sufficient, even when the velocities and forces of specimen application were randomized. In contrast, for discriminating pairs of spring cells, tactile information alone was insufficient, and both tactile and kinesthetic information were found to be necessary. 5. The differences in the sufficiency of tactile information for the discrimination of the two types of objects can be explained by the mechanics of contact of the fingerpad and its effect on tactile information. For objects with deformable surfaces, the spatial pressure distribution within the contact region depends on both the force applied and the specimen compliance.

TI  - Tactual perception of texture
PY  - 1973
AB  - The perception of texture by touch is examined initially by reviewing past experiments dealing with sensations of roughness and vibration. The perceptual qualities of active and passive touch are distinguished, and current trends of research on roughness perception are summarized. A proposed model of texture perception defines the transducer function involved in the interaction between the skin and an object surface. Three basic feedback loops participating in the control and information flow are included in the model.

TI  - Tactual perception: a review of experimental variables and procedures
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper reviews the literature on tactual perception. Throughout this review, we will highlight some of the most relevant aspects in the touch literature: type of stimuli; type of participants; type of tactile exploration; and finally, the interaction between touch and other senses. Regarding type of stimuli, we will analyse studies with abstract stimuli such as vibrations, with two- and three-dimensional stimuli, and also concrete stimuli, considering the relation between familiar and unfamiliar stimuli and the haptic perception of faces. Under the "type of participants" topic, we separated studies with blind participants, studies with children and adults, and also performed an overview of sex differences in performance. The type of tactile exploration is explored considering conditions of active and passive touch, the relevance of movement in touch and the relation between haptic exploration and time. Finally, interactions between touch and vision, touch and smell and touch and taste are explored in the last topic. The review ends with an overall conclusion on the state of the art for the tactual perception literature. With this work, we intend to present an organised overview of the main variables in touch experiments, compiling aspects reported in the tactual literature, and attempting to provide both a summary of previous findings, and a guide to the design of future works on tactual perception and memory, through a presentation of implications from previous studies.

TI  - Tactual roughness perception: Spatial and temporal determinants
PY  - 1983
AB  - Investigated M. M. Taylor and S. J. Lederman's (see record 1975-10788-001) model of tactual roughness perception. According to this model, felt roughness is best predicted by modeling the intensive aspects of instantaneous skin displacement, as determined primarily by groove and ridge width and by finger force. Two experiments involving a total of 14 young right-handed adults were conducted. Exp I showed that magnitude estimates of the felt roughness of linear gratings were not affected by either spatial period or groove-to-ridge ratio. Exp II found only negligible effects on perceived roughness of varying the relative speed of motion between skin and surface, whether active or passive touch was used. The results of both experiments argue strongly against a temporal coding theory of roughness perception, and serve to clarify and strengthen Taylor and Lederman's model.

TI  - Tactual shape perception in relation to the understanding of geometrical concepts by blind students
PY  - 2002
AB  - Tactual shape perception is a synthesis of many parameters which lead blind students to make sense of external stimuli. It is vital to investigate this field of perception because it reveals many differences between passive and active touch. The van Hiele model provides a tool for investigating and classifying students’ thinking in geometry. In a study of 19 blind and visually impaired students in a special school in Greece, we sought to understand their own way of approaching, developing and understanding concepts of shape. The findings support on one hand the appropriateness of the van Hiele theory and on the other the complexity of tactual shape perception and its uniqueness with respect to every student's thinking. Teachers and specialists can enrich their understanding and be more effective when teaching geometrical concepts that require taking into account variables such as: touch, movement, posture, type of shape, language, prior knowledge and the conditions of the task. © 2002, Sage Publications.

TI  - Taekwondo training improves balance in volunteers over 40
PY  - 2013
AB  - Balance deteriorates with age, and may eventually lead to falling accidents which may threaten independent living. As Taekwondo contains various highly dynamic movement patterns, Taekwondo practice may sustain or improve balance. Therefore, in 24 middle-aged healthy volunteers (40-71 year) we investigated effects of age-adapted Taekwondo training of 1 h a week during 1 year on various balance parameters, such as: motor orientation ability (primary outcome measure), postural and static balance test, single leg stance, one leg hop test, and a questionnaire. Motor orientation ability significantly increased in favor of the antero-posterior direction with a difference of 0.62 degrees toward anterior compared to pre-training measurement, when participants corrected the tilted platform rather toward the posterior direction; female gender being an independent outcome predictor. On postural balance measurements sway path improved in all 19 participants, with a median of 9.3 mm/s (range 0.71-45.86), sway area in 15 participants with 4.2 mm(2)/s (range 17.39-1.22). Static balance improved with an average of 5.34 s for the right leg, and with almost 4 s for the left. Median single leg stance duration increased in 17 participants with 5 s (range 1-16), and in 13 participants with 8 s (range 1-18). The average one leg hop test distance increased (not statistically significant) with 9.5 cm. The questionnaire reported a better "ability to maintain balance" in 16. In conclusion, our data suggest that age-adapted Taekwondo training improves various aspects of balance control in healthy people over the age of 40.

TI  - Tailoring visual images to fit: Value creation in persuasive messages
PY  - 2010
AB  - The present studies aimed to extend Regultaory Fit Theon, in the domain of persuasive communication by (a) using printed advertisement images without any verbal claim, instead of purely or mostly verbal messages; (b) selecting the images to fit the distinct orientations of regulatory mode rather than regulatory focus: and (c) priming regulatory mode orientation instead of relying on chronic prevalence of either locomotion or assessment orientation. We found that recipients printed with a locomotion orientation experienced fit, and were more persuaded, when exposed to "dynamic" versus "static" visual images; conversely, recipients primed with an assessment orientation experienced fit and were more persuaded when exposed to "static" versus "dynamic" images. Our findings show that the experience of fit can be induced by visual Messages, resulting in positive effects in terms of attitude toward product advertisement and estimated price of advertised products.

TI  - Takete and Maluma in Action: A Cross-Modal Relationship between Gestures and Sounds
PY  - 2016
AB  - Despite Saussure's famous observation that sound-meaning relationships are in principle arbitrary, we now have a substantial body of evidence that sounds themselves can have meanings, patterns often referred to as "sound symbolism". Previous studies have found that particular sounds can be associated with particular meanings, and also with particular static visual shapes. Less well studied is the association between sounds and dynamic movements. Using a free elicitation method, the current experiment shows that several sound symbolic associations between sounds and dynamic movements exist: (1) front vowels are more likely to be associated with small movements than with large movements; (2) front vowels are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (3) obstruents are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (4) voiced obstruents are more likely to be associated with large movements than with small movements. All of these results are compatible with the results of the previous studies of sound symbolism using static images or meanings. Overall, the current study supports the hypothesis that particular dynamic motions can be associated with particular sounds. Building on the current results, we discuss a possible practical application of these sound symbolic associations in sports instructions.

TI  - Taking it all in...when physical practice time is not available, mental practice time often is
PY  - 1998
AB  - What I mean by "taking it in" is to be a focused listener. You could say that there are two ways of listening: active listening and passive listening. An active listener would be someone whose mind absorbs whatever they hear. On the other hand, a passive listener would be one who has information go in one ear and out the other. Five minutes of focused practice, either physical or mental, is better than two hours of unfocused practice. Work towards becoming an active listener. I consider myself very fortunate to have grown up in a musical family. My father, Doug Grace, and my older brother, Danny Grace, are both great drummers. Needless to say life in my house was one perpetual drum lesson. While my father was talking about and playing recordings of Gene Krupa, Chick Webb, Baby Dodds, Papa Jo Jones, Louis Bellson ... my brother was influencing me with music from Steely Dan, Grand Funk, Yes, Weather Report. I would have to say that these were some of the most valuable lessons I've ever had.

Stephen Covey, author of Seven Habits of Highly Effective People says it all in Habit number Five--"Seek first to understand, and then be understood". - Learn to be a great interviewer with great questions. The success of your patient relationships is directly related to the team's ability to ask thought provoking and relevant questions and take the time to listen to the answers. Good questions include open-ended questions that don't require a simple yes or no answer. Learn to remove "have you," "could you," "do you," or "are you" and replace them with what, why, where, when, and how. You cannot learn to read people if you don't encourage patients to think about their responses and share more of themselves. - Develop the skill of listening and the ability to retain what you have heard. Being a good listener is two-fold and includes passive and active abilities. Passive listening communicates to the sender that you've received their message without judgment with acknowledgments and door openers. An acknowledgement tells the speaker that you have received their message and want to know more; examples are "really," "hum," "wow." A door opener encourages the patient to continue without your interruption, "go on," "continue," "and then what?"

TI  - Talking "responsibility": A developmental-discursive study of relational accounts
PY  - 2001
AB  - This study examined the effect of conversational interventions on talk about responsibility for problems in intimate relationships. A developmental-discursive framework joined developmental psychology's orthogenetic principles with discursive psychology's emphasis on language use. Forty adults (20 men, 20 women) discussed responsibility for issues in their intimate relationships during a semi-structured interview. Having previously chosen two issues, participants were asked to describe one in terms of responsibility before and the other after, one of four conversational interventions (active listening, responsibility-focused listening, eliciting perspective-taking and specifying agency). The resulting accounts were assessed for changes in the portrayal of responsibility. Transcripts were analyzed using a novel unit of analysis, a Responsibility Statement, coded along a developmental continuum from Non-Relational (No Agent, External Agent, Individual Agent) to Relational (Shared Agents, Differentiated, Integrated, Relational-Contextual). The developmental level of accounts (degree of differentiation and integration of agency) was more relational after than before intervention. However, there were no significant differences between interview conditions. Discursive analyses demonstrated various modes of establishing Non-relational agency (constituting Passive or Isolated agents) and Relational agency (constituting Equal, Differentiated or Integrated Agents). Applicability of the developmental-discursive model to future study of agency constitution was discussed.

AB  - When someone talks, someone else usually listens. Listening has the following traits: 1. It is active, not passive. 2. It is dependent on concentrated attention. 3. It is more than a means of obtaining information. 4. It is a means of obliging information to assume meaningful patterns, which can then be processed and used in various ways. Almost anyone is guaranteed instant improvement in communication by taking the trouble to listen more effectively. Active listening includes a variety of behaviors that communicate to others that they are heard and understood, that the feelings underlying the words are appreciated and accepted, and that the speaker is accepted as a person by the listener. Behaviors that will, if practiced faithfully, generate attitudes of tolerance and understanding, which will make empathy and nonevaluative acceptance of the other come more easily, include: 1. paraphrasing the content, 2. reflecting the implications, 3. reflecting the underlying feelings, and 4. inviting further contributions.

Historically targets of interest were marine mammals. More recently, however, requirements include fish. Sonars are particularly useful in this aggressive environment where visibility is minimal and monitoring is required round the clock. The SeaTec software examines multibeam sonar data and extracts moving targets before performing rudimentary classification. Classification includes targets determined to be drifting with the tide or those that appear to have their own source of propulsion. This paper contains a description of the techniques used to detect, track and perform rudimentary classification of targets. Image processing techniques are used to perform target identification, followed by a geometric approach to target tracking, and human-observer inspired techniques for classification. The work described in this paper is related to the use of the SeaTec software in the first stage of the Integrated Active and Passive Acoustic System for Environmental Monitoring of Fish and Marine Mammals in Tidal Energy Sites (ISEM) project. The next stage is analysis of SeaTec’s interpretation of the collected data by SMRU and ACER scientists.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a small-sized and low-cost unit to provide attitude measurements for lightloaded, small-sized and cost effective agricultural robot application. The attitude measurement unit comprised an electronic control unit (ECU) and a gyroscope and an accelerometer within a small-sized and low-cost IMU. In order to avoid the measurement limitations of a single sensor, a self-adaptive complementary filter and a Kalman filter were discussed and compared for sensor fusion. By comparison, in respect of preventing angle drift and maintaining dynamic characteristics, the Kalman filter has the significant advantage, especially in dynamic motion. In the comparison with a highly precise aviation-level fiber optic gyroscope (FOG), the results showed that the static angle drift was restrained by Kalman filter which reached the performance of the FOG. And in the series of farm experiments, the dynamic characteristic of the developed attitude measurement unit is close to the FOG performance in the sub-degree level. This is an acceptable accuracy for light-loaded, small-sized and cost effective agricultural robot application such as agriculture drone, greenhouse robots, harvesting robot arm and so on.

These ERPs are often recorded using passive or unspecific instructions. Patient data obtained this way are then compared to data from healthy participants, which are usually recorded using active instructions. The present study investigates the effect of attentive modulations and particularly the effect of active vs. passive instruction on the ERP components mismatch negativity (MMN) and N400. A sample of 18 healthy participants listened to three auditory paradigms: an oddball, a word priming, and a sentence paradigm. Each paradigm was presented three times with different instructions: ignoring auditory stimuli, passive listening, and focused attention on the auditory stimuli. After each task, the participants indicated their subjective effort. The N400 decreased from the focused task to the passive task, and was extinct in the ignore task. The MMN exhibited higher amplitudes in the focused and passive task compared to the ignore task. The data indicate an effect of attention on the supratemporal component of the MMN. Subjective effort was equally high in the passive and focused tasks but reduced in the ignore task. We conclude that passive listening during EEG recording is stressful and attenuates ERPs, which renders the interpretation of the results obtained in such conditions difficult. © 2014 Erlbeck, Kübler, Kotchoubey and Veser.

TI  - Task or Virtual Reality Intervention for Improving UE Function
PY  - 2019
AB  - Potential participants will be screened for age, history of stroke, brain injury, or cerebral palsy, and having one functional arm and one poorly functioning arm by phone. Those who meet the basic criteria will be scheduled for an Intake Evaluation consisting of obtaining voluntary informed consent, complete a demographic survey, visual field testing, cognitive screening, perceptual testing, and an arm/hand function test. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a Preliminary Evaluation. The Preliminary Evaluation will measure the current motor control ability, perception of level of disability, and amount of active and passive motion in the involved arm. Participants will participate in the first form of intervention (randomly assigned) for three 30 minute sessions per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re‐evaluated using the same tests conducted during the Preliminary Evaluation with the addition of the arm/hand function test conducted during the initial screening. Participants will participate in the second form of intervention for three 30 minute sessions per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re‐evaluated using the same tests conducted following the first intervention. One month after completing the second form of intervention, participants will be re‐evaluated using the same tests used following the second intervention and will also receive a semi‐structured interview regarding their thoughts and experiences during the study and their perceptions of the outcomes.

TI  - Task-dependent modulation of regions in the left temporal cortex during auditory sentence comprehension
PY  - 2015
AB  - Numerous studies have revealed the essential role of the left lateral temporal cortex in auditory sentence comprehension along with evidence of the functional specialization of the anterior and posterior temporal sub-areas. However, it is unclear whether task demands (e.g., active vs. passive listening) modulate the functional specificity of these sub-areas. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we addressed this issue by applying both independent component analysis (ICA) and general linear model (GLM) methods. Consistent with previous studies, intelligible sentences elicited greater activity in the left lateral temporal cortex relative to unintelligible sentences. Moreover, responses to intelligibility in the sub-regions were differentially modulated by task demands. While the overall activation patterns of the anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (STS/MTG) were equivalent during both passive and active tasks, a middle portion of the STS/MTG was found to be selectively activated only during the active task under a refined analysis of sub-regional contributions. Our results not only confirm the critical role of the left lateral temporal cortex in auditory sentence comprehension but further demonstrate that task demands modulate functional specialization of the anterior-middle-posterior temporal sub-areas.

TI  - Taxonomy and implementation of redirection techniques for ubiquitous passive haptic feedback
PY  - 2008
AB  - Traveling through immersive virtual environments (IVEs) by means of real walking is an important activity to increase naturalness of VR-based interaction. However, the size of the virtual world often exceeds the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Redirected walking is one concept to solve this problem of walking in IVEs by inconspicuously guiding the user on a physical path that may differ from the path the user visually perceives. When the user approaches a virtual object she can be redirected to a real proxy object that is registered to the virtual counterpart and provides passive haptic feedback. In such passive haptic environments, any number of virtual objects can be mapped to proxy objects having similar haptic properties, e.g., size, shape and texture. The user can sense a virtual object by touching its real world counterpart. Redirecting a user to a registered proxy object makes it necessary to predict the user's intended position in the IVE. Based on this target position we determine a path through the physical space such that the user is guided to the registered proxy object. We present a taxonomy of possible redirection techniques that enable user guidance such that inconsistencies between visual and proprioceptive stimuli are imperceptible. We describe how a user's target in the virtual world can be predicted reliably and how a corresponding real-world path to the registered proxy object can be derived. © 2008 IEEE.

TI  - Teaching a humanoid robot to draw 'Shapes'
PY  - 2011
AB  - The core cognitive ability to perceive and synthesize 'shapes' underlies all our basic interactions with the world, be it shaping one's fingers to grasp a ball or shaping one's body while imitating a dance. In this article, we describe our attempts to understand this multifaceted problem by creating a primitive shape perception/synthesis system for the baby humanoid iCub. We specifically deal with the scenario of iCub gradually learning to draw or scribble shapes of gradually increasing complexity, after observing a demonstration by a teacher, by using a series of self evaluations of its performance. Learning to imitate a demonstrated human movement (specifically, visually observed end-effector trajectories of a teacher) can be considered as a special case of the proposed computational machinery. This architecture is based on a loop of transformations that express the embodiment of the mechanism but, at the same time, are characterized by scale invariance and motor equivalence. The following transformations are integrated in the loop: (a) Characterizing in a compact, abstract way the 'shape' of a demonstrated trajectory using a finite set of critical points, derived using catastrophe theory: Abstract Visual Program (AVP); (b) Transforming the AVP into a Concrete Motor Goal (CMG) in iCub's egocentric space; (c) Learning to synthesize a continuous virtual trajectory similar to the demonstrated shape using the discrete set of critical points defined in CMG; (d) Using the virtual trajectory as an attractor for iCub's internal body model, implemented by the Passive Motion Paradigm which includes a forward and an inverse motor model; (e) Forming an Abstract Motor Program (AMP) by deriving the 'shape' of the self generated movement (forward model output) using the same technique employed for creating the AVP; (f) Comparing the AVP and AMP in order to generate an internal performance score and hence closing the learning loop. The resulting computational framework further combines three crucial streams of learning: (1) motor babbling (self exploration), (2) imitative action learning (social interaction) and (3) mental simulation, to give rise to sensorimotor knowledge that is endowed with seamless compositionality, generalization capability and body-effectors/task independence. The robustness of the computational architecture is demonstrated by means of several experimental trials of gradually increasing complexity using a state of the art humanoid platform.

AB  - This article presents the development of a didactic game for the teaching-learning of the basic language of Ecuadorian signs, for the hearing impaired and / or interested in learning the basic sign language of Ecuador. The input device is a Leap Motion, which detects the gestural signals in the Unity3D software. For the processing of the signals, there is a classification system implemented in MatLab for the two types of signal configuration: static and dynamic; correlation is used if the configuration is static (no motion signal) and the DTW algorithm is used for dynamic (motion signal) configurations. Communication between Unity3D and MatLab is done using shared memory. This development core acquires a didactic use with two games, implemented in Unity3D for single player and multiplayer.

PY  - 2017
AB  - This study gathered scientific knowledge on physical therapists' role in elderly with terminal diseases through a review following Cochrane methodology. Searches in SIBRADID, SciELO and PubMed sites revealed only seven empirical studies on this subject, and almost all of them were related to patients with advanced cancer. Only two of them referenced other diseases: congestive heart failure, rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, fractures, bronchitis, stroke. Physical therapists' main roles found on the articles were: help patients mantaining their self identity; support them on keeping an active life until death; bring comfort; promote a functional training; support body activity; help patients in maintaining autonomy; afford social contact with family and friends and promote caregiving education. Symptoms identified on patients from the seven studies were: fatigue; short breath; locomotion impairment; functional loss; anxiety; muscle spasm; pain; weakness; sputum accumulation; pressure sores; balance impairment; contracture; constipation; depression; swelling. Physical therapists' most cited therapeutic measures were: massage; passive, active and assisted-active movements; positioning in bed; transfer manoeuvres; bed transfers; infrared lamp; transcutaneous electrical stimulation; compression and elevation; respiratory manoeuvres; postural drenaige; diaphragmatic breathing; cough stimulation; aspiration; ambulatory devices prescription; gait train. Palliative care are uncommon sort of treatment in our society, nevertheless, they are an important ethical option when dealing with terminal patients. Physical therapy has a determinant place on multidisciplinary team, since it improves patients sense of well being and quality of life.

TI  - Temperature Measurement of Gases using Acoustic Means
PY  - 2009
AB  - Traditional temperature measurement devices such as bimetallic strips, thermocouples, RTDs, radiation devices (i.e. Infrared), silicon P-N junctions etc. all have limitations such as range or slow response times due to them having to 'reach' temperature. These limitations, while normally not an issue become so where high speed operation or large temperature ranges are either required and/or likely to be encountered. Kleppe [1, 2] and Stones[3] describe methods based on Acoustic Pyrometry for high speed high temperature measurement in flue gas flows and high pressure burner combustors. However most Acoustic Pyrometric schemes use active acoustics in that an acoustic wave of sufficient power and frequency (usually ultrasonic) is introduced into the medium to be received by an appropriate transducer a distance away. From the resultant time of flight (TOF) of the transmitted signal the speed of sound in that gas region can be determined.The aim of this paper is to discuss the use of passive acoustic sensors that utilise the self generating pressure pulses in a dynamic gas flow.

TI  - Temperature dependence of photoemission from quantum-well states in Ag/V(100): Moving surface-vacuum barrier effects
PY  - 2001
AB  - The temperature dependence of angle-resolved photoemission from quantum-well states in ultrathin films of Ag on V(100) has been examined for films from 1-8 ML thickness within the temperature range 45-600 K. Contrary to bulk solids, the photoemission peaks shift to higher binding energy as the temperature is increased. The temperature dependence of the peak widths is linear, consistent with the expected behavior for electron-phonon coupling, but the coupling parameter lambda is found to show a strong oscillatory dependence on film thickness, with some values many times larger than those found for bulk silver. The observations are explained in terms of the influence on both the initial and final states in the photoemission process of the static and dynamic movements of the surface-vacuum interface barrier induced by temperature changes.

TI  - Temperature perception on the hand during static versus dynamic contact with a surface
PY  - 2009
AB  - Innocuous cooling or heating of the forearm can evoke nociceptive sensations, such as burning, stinging, and pricking (low-threshold thermal nociception, LTN), that are inhibited by dynamic contact. In the present study, I investigated whether LTN can also be perceived on the hand, and if so, whether it is normally suppressed by active touching. Innocuous cold (28 degrees, 25 degrees, and 18 degrees C) and warm (38 degrees, 40 degrees, and 43 degrees C) temperatures were delivered to the distal metacarpal pads and intermediate and distal phalanges of the fingers via a handgrip thermode that subjects either statically held or actively grasped. The same temperatures were delivered to the forearm via another thermode that either rested on the arm or was touched to the arm. Subjects rated the intensity of thermal (warmth, cold) and nociceptive (e.g., burning) sensations and indicated the qualities of sensation experienced. The results showed that LTN can be perceived on the hand, although less frequently and less intensely than on the forearm. Dynamic contact inhibited nociceptive and thermal sensations on the hand, although less strongly than on the forearm. These findings indicate that temperature perception on the hand is attenuated and its quality is changed when thermal stimulation is accompanied by dynamic tactile stimulation, as it is during haptic exploration.

TI  - Template-based recognition of pose and motion gestures on a mobile robot
PY  - 1998
AB  - For mobile robots to assist people in everyday life, they must be easy to instruct. This paper describes a gesture-based interface for human robot interaction, which enables people to instruct robots through easy-to-perform arm gestures. Such gestures might be static pose gestures, which involve only a specific configuration of the person's arm, or they might be dynamic motion gestures (such as waving). Gestures are recognized in real-time at approximate frame rate, using a hybrid approach that integrates neural networks and template matching. A fast, color-based tracking algorithm enables the robot to track and follow a person reliably through office environments with drastically changing lighting conditions. Results are reported in the context of an interactive clean-up task, where a person guides the robot to specific locations that need to be cleaned, and the robot picks up trash which it then delivers to the nearest trash-bin.

TI  - Temporal Discrimination Thresholds and Proprioceptive Performance: Impact of Age and Nerve Conduction
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Increasing attention is payed to the contribution of somatosensory processing in motor control. In particular, temporal somatosensory discrimination has been found to be altered differentially in common movement disorders. To date, there have only been speculations as to how impaired temporal discrimination and clinical motor signs may relate to each other. Prior to disentangling this relationship, potential confounders of temporal discrimination, in particular age and peripheral nerve conduction, should be assessed, and a quantifiable measure of proprioceptive performance should be established. Objective: To assess the influence of age and polyneuropathy (PNP) on somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold (STDT), temporal discrimination movement threshold (TDMT), and behavioral measures of proprioception of upper and lower limbs. Methods: STDT and TDMT were assessed in 79 subjects (54 healthy, 25 with PNP; age 30–79 years). STDT was tested with surface electrodes over the thenar or dorsal foot region. TDMT was probed with needle electrodes in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Goniometer-based devices were used to assess limb proprioception during (i) active pointing to LED markers, (ii) active movements in response to variable visual cues, and (iii) estimation of limb position following passive movements. Pointing (or estimation) error was taken as a measure of proprioceptive performance. Results: In healthy subjects, higher age was associated with higher STDT and TDMT at upper and lower extremities, while age did not correlate with proprioceptive performance. Patients with PNP showed higher STDT and TDMT values and decreased proprioceptive performance in active pointing tasks compared to matched healthy subjects. As an additional finding, there was a significant correlation between performance in active pointing tasks and temporal discrimination thresholds. Conclusion: Given their notable impact on measures of temporal discrimination, age and peripheral nerve conduction need to be accounted for if STDT and TDMT are applied in patients with movement disorders. As a side observation, the correlation between measures of proprioception and temporal discrimination may prompt further studies on the presumptive link between these two domains. © Copyright © 2019 Odorfer, Wind and Zeller.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Meiofauna within the Hyporheic Zone of Goose Creek, Virginia
PY  - 1990
AB  - Despite the vast number of ecological studies on marine meiofauna, little is known about freshwater meiofauna. As part of a larger project on the active and passive movement patterns of stream meiofauna, I report here on an intensive sampling effort undertaken to gather temporal and spatial information on the composition and abundance of meiofauna in a fourth-order stream (Goose Creek) in northern Virginia. Meiofaunal abundance and vertical distribution in the hyporheic zone (0 to 50 cm) were measured from Jan 1988-Jan 1989. Median grain size at the site was 1000 ,um and discharge varied significantly with highest flows in April and May following heavy spring rains. Total meiofaunal abundance in the streambed averaged >2000/10 cm2 over the year but reached nearly 6000/10 cm2 during late June, primarily due to rotifers. Five taxa constituted 85-99% of the community: rotifers, oligochaetes, early instar chironomids, nematodes, and copepods. Pronounced seasonal variation occurred for each group. Rotifer, oligochaete, and copepod abundances were significantly related to discharge with abundances declining in surface layers after major floods. Meiofauna were distributed through all depths in the hyporheic zone for most of the year but abundances were more shallow in July and August when water flow and oxygen penetration decreased.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Meiofauna Fluctuations in an Inlet of the South West Baltic (Darss‐Zingst Bodden Chain) with Special Reference to the Harpacticoida (Copepoda, Crustacea)
PY  - 1988
AB  - Diurnal, seasonal and annual fluctuations of the meiofauna population density were recorded during long term investigations carried out in an inlet of the southwestern coast of the Baltic from 1970 to 1980. Field experiments have shown a diurnal vertical migration of harpacticoids, which leave the sediment at night to colonize the pelagic zone 14 times more densely than during day. Besides the seasonal fluctuations considerable differences were observed between the meiofauna densities in two successive years from samples taken twice in a grid consisting of 98 stations: the abundances of all meiofauna taxa decreased by approximately 50 %. These fluctuations are not only caused by the reproductive activities of the meiofauna under different environmental conditions, but they are to a great extent a result of the active and passive movements of the meiofauna.

TI  - Temporal aspects of visual perception in demyelinative diseases
PY  - 2015
AB  - The study aims to test whether impaired conduction velocities following optic neuritis (ON) serve as a limiting factor on various temporal, as compared to static, aspects of vision. Critical Flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), two motion perception tasks (object and number-from-motion extraction tasks), high and low contrast acuities, and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were assessed in 23 ON patients. Strong correlations were found between the various dynamic visual function scores. Furthermore, regression models revealed that each of the dynamic visual functions significantly predicted VEP latencies. These findings were specific to patients' affected eyes and were not evident for static visual functions. Fellow eyes' VEP latencies were best predicted by the VEP latencies of the affected eyes. The similar impact of VEP latencies on various dynamic visual functions suggests conduction velocity to be the common limiting factor for temporal-related visual perceptual abilities. The specificity of these findings to the patients' affected eyes and to dynamic visual functions highlights the precision of dynamic visual functions for identifying demyelinative attack. Prolonged VEP latencies in the fellow eyes seem to stem from different patho-physiological processes. The hypothesis that inter-eye synchronization in conduction latencies is important to accomplish visual processing (binocular vision) is further discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal coding of contrast in primary visual cortex: When, what, and why
PY  - 2001
AB  - How do neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) encode the contrast of a visual stimulus? In this paper, the information that V1 responses convey about the contrast of static visual stimuli is explicitly calculated. These responses often contain several easily distinguished temporal components, which will be called latency, transient, tonic, and off. Calculating the information about contrast conveyed in each component and in groups of components makes it possible to delineate aspects of the temporal structure that may be relevant for contrast encoding. The results indicate that as much or more contrast-related information is encoded into the temporal structure of spike train responses as into the firing rate and that the temporally coded information is manifested most strongly in the latency to response onset. Transient, tonic, and off responses contribute relatively little. The results also reveal that temporal coding is important for distinguishing subtle contrast differences, whereas firing rates are useful for gross discrimination. This suggests that the temporal structure of neurons' responses may extend the dynamic range for contrast encoding in the primate visual system.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of contingency extraction from tonal and verbal auditory sequences
PY  - 2015
AB  - Consecutive sound events are often to some degree predictive of each other. Here we investigated the brain's capacity to detect contingencies between consecutive sounds by means of electroencephalography (EEG) during passive listening. Contingencies were embedded either within tonal or verbal stimuli. Contingency extraction was measured indirectly via the elicitation of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential (ERP) by contingency violations. MMN results indicate that structurally identical forms of predictability can be extracted from both tonal and verbal stimuli. We also found similar generators to underlie the processing of contingency violations across stimulus types, as well as similar performance in an active-listening follow-up test. However, the process of passive contingency extraction was considerably slower (twice as many rule exemplars were needed) for verbal than for tonal stimuli These results suggest caution in transferring findings on complex predictive regularity processing obtained with tonal stimuli directly to the speech domain.

AB  - In recent years, the use of non-invasive techniques (EEG/MEG) to measure the similar to 80 Hz ("gamma") oscillations generated by the primary motor cortex during motor control has been well validated. However, primary motor cortex gamma oscillations have yet to be systematically compared with lower frequency (30-50 Hz, 'piper') corticomuscular coherence in the same tasks. In this paper, primary cortex gamma oscillations and piper corticomuscular coherence are compared for three types of movements: simple abductions of the index finger, repetitive abductions of the index finger of different extents and frequencies and static abduction of the index finger at two different force levels. For simple movements, piper coherence and gamma amplitude followed very similar time courses with coherence appearing at approximately half the frequency of cortical gamma oscillations. No evidence of 2:1 phase-phase coupling was observed. A similar pattern of results was observed for repetitive movements varying in size and frequency; however, during the production of static force, the time courses became dissociated. During these movements, EMG piper amplitude was sustained for the entire contraction; gamma power showed a burst at onset but no piper corticomuscular coherence was observed. For these data, this dissociation suggests that while primary motor cortex gamma oscillations and piper corticomuscular coherence may often co-occur during the production of dynamic movements, they probably reflect different functional processes in motor control.

TI  - Temporal dynamics, residency and site fidelity of spawning aggregations of a herbivorous tropical reef fish Siganus sutor
PY  - 2013
AB  - The shoemaker spinefoot Siganus sutor is a fast-growing, short-lived, gonochorist and herbivorous reef fish that forms transient fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). In the Seychelles, FSAs of this species occur monthly between September and June around the full moon. To study the spawning aggregation dynamics of S. sutor, 39 reproductively active individuals were acoustically tagged and monitored at 3 known FSA sites (Pate Polite, Pate Desire and Pate Dividi) off the west coast of Praslin island (Seychelles) between October 2010 and April 2011. The presence and absence of tagged fish at the 3 sites were monitored using moored arrays of passive acoustic receivers, while the density of fish at the FSAs was quantified using underwater visual census (UVC). Most tagged fish (87.0%) detected in more than 1 spawning period showed fidelity to single spawning sites. Predominantly, tagged individuals arrived at FSA sites at dawn and departed at dusk. Spawning residency times at FSA sites ranged from 0.02 to 16.1 d. At Pate Polite, residency times were higher in the first half of the spawning season. Residency times were often several-fold shorter than aggregation duration which, when combined with patterns in arrival and departure times, indicates high turnover of fish within aggregations. The findings of this study provide information needed for emerging co-management schemes that aim to sustain this socio-economically important fishery.

TI  - Temporal integration in sound localization via head rotation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Information about a sound source’s location in the front/back dimension is present in the relation between head rotation and the resulting changes in interaural time- or level-difference cues. The use of such dynamic cues for localization requires the auditory system to have access to an accurate representation of the orientation and motion of the head in space. We measured, in active and passive rotation conditions, and as a function of head-rotation angle and velocity, normally hearing human listeners’ ability to localize front and rear sources of a low-frequency (0.5–1 kHz) noise band that was not accurately localizable in the absence of head motion. Targets were presented while the head was in motion at velocities of 50–400°/s (active neck rotation) or 25–100°/s (whole-body passive rotation), and were gated on and off as the head passed through a variable-width spatial window. Accuracy increased as window width was increased, which provided access to larger interaural cue changes, but decreased as head-turn velocity increased, which reduced the duration of the stimuli. For both active and passive rotation, these effects were almost exactly reciprocal, such that performance was related primarily to the duration of the stimulus, with ∼100 ms duration required for 75% correct front/back discrimination regardless of the cue-change magnitude or mode of rotation. The efficacy of the dynamic auditory cues in the passive rotation condition suggests that vestibular input is sufficient to inform the auditory system about head motion.

TI  - Temporal patterns in the acoustic presence of baleen whale species in a presumed breeding area off Namibia
PY  - 2019
AB  - The eastern Atlantic Ocean is considered to provide important breeding and wintering habitats for several migratory cetacean species. The spatio-temporal distributions and migratory behaviors of cetaceans off southern Africa are nevertheless still poorly understood. This study investigated the temporal patterns of acoustic occurrence of baleen whales in a presumed baleen whale breeding area off Namibia using passive acoustic recordings collected between November 2011 and May 2013. Our results show seasonal acoustic presence of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, fin whales Balaenoptera physalus and Antarctic minke whales B. bonaerensis from November to January and from June to August. Their acoustic absence from February to May possibly indicates that most animals migrated to other areas (presumably in higher latitudes) in austral summer to feed. By contrast, Antarctic blue whales B. musculus intermedia were acoustically present throughout the recording period, indicating that part of the population remains at lower latitudes year-round. Our findings support the presumed ecological importance of the oceanic area off Namibia, providing (part of) a suitable cetacean wintering and, possibly, breeding range or migratory corridor. Furthermore, the occurrence of Antarctic blue and minke whales off Namibia, concurrent with their reported acoustic presence in high-latitude feeding areas, adds to growing evidence that baleen whale migration is not obligate but much more dynamic than has long been assumed.

TI  - Temporal patterns of chimpanzee loud calls in the Issa Valley, Tanzania: Evidence of nocturnal acoustic behavior in wild chimpanzees
PY  - 2018
AB  - ObjectivesMuch is known about chimpanzee diurnal call patterns, but far less about night-time vocal behavior. I deployed a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system to assess 24-hr temporal acoustic activity of wild, unhabituated chimpanzees that live in a woodland mosaic habitat similar to hominin landscapes from the Plio-Pleistocene. A primary aim was to apply findings to our broader understanding to chimpanzee 24-hr activity patterns, and what implications this may have for reconstructing hominin adaptations to similarly hot, dry, and open landscapes. I also tested whether chimpanzees conform to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, and produce loud calls during periods of optimal sound transmission.MethodsNine custom-made solar-powered acoustic transmission units (SPATUs) recorded continuously for 250 days over 11 months in the Issa Valley, western Tanzania. I complemented acoustic data with environmental data from weather stations as well as behavioral data collected on chimpanzee nest group sizes to assess the relationship between party size and calling.ResultsChimpanzees called at all hours of the day and night in both wet and dry seasons, and night and day calls exhibited parallel rates/month, although twilight calls were produced significantly more in the dry, compared to the wet season. Calls were more likely during warmer temperatures and lower humidity. Call rate was positively associated with (nest) party size and counter-calls exhibited no temporal variation in their origins (similar vs. adjacent valleys).ConclusionsChimpanzees were acoustically active throughout the 24-hr cycle, although at low rates compared to diurnal activity, revealing night-time activity in an ape otherwise described as diurnal. Chimpanzee loud calls partially, and weakly, conformed to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis and likely responded to social, rather than environmental factors. Call rates accurately reflect grouping patterns and PAM is demonstrated to be an effective means of remotely assessing activity, especially at times and from places that are difficult to access for researchers.

TI  - Temporal processing of active and passive head movement
PY  - 2011
AB  - The brain can know about an active head movement even in advance of its execution by means of an efference copy signal. In fact, sensory correlates of active movements appear to be suppressed. Passive disturbances of the head, however, can be detected only by sensory feedback. Might the perceived timing of an active head movement be speeded relative to the perception of a passive movement due to the efferent copy (anticipation hypothesis) or delayed because of sensory suppression (suppression hypothesis)? We compared the perceived timing of active and passive head movement using other sensory events as temporal reference points. Participants made unspeeded temporal order and synchronicity judgments comparing the perceived onset of active and passive head movement with the onset of tactile, auditory and visual stimuli. The comparison stimuli had to be delayed by about 45 ms to appear coincident with passive head movement or by about 80 ms to appear aligned with an active head movement. The slow perceptual reaction to vestibular activation is compatible with our earlier study using galvanic stimulation (Barnett-Cowan and Harris 2009). The unexpected additional delay in processing the timing of an active head movement is compatible with the suppression hypothesis and is discussed in relation to suppression of vestibular signals during self-generated head movement.

TI  - Temporomandibular arthrokinetic reflex control of the mandibular musculature
PY  - 1975
AB  - The results of an experimental electromyographic investigation of temporomandibular arthrokinetic reflex control of the mandibular musculature are reported. Co-ordinated, rapidly adapting and slowly adapting facilitatory and inhibitory reflex changes in motor unit activity in the mandibular musculature were evoked by graduated passive movements of the isolated (but innervated) temporomandibular joint. Induced dysfunction of regionally discrete groups of articular mechanoreceptors was shown to result in specific changes in static and dynamic reflex motor unit activity. The possible clinical significance of these changes is discussed. © 1975.

TI  - Temporomandibular joint movements during tracheal intubation
PY  - 1996
AB  - Laryngoscopy causes temporary postoperative dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ): during iatrogenic TMJ manipulation in anaesthetised patients, the TMJs have lost the protection afforded by the tone of the surrounding muscles. Thus far, the exact type and extent of TMJ movements have not been known. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to visualise and assess TMJ movements during intubation by means of electronic axiography, a diagnostic monitor of TMJ movements used in dentistry: registration of the hinge axis (HA) as an equivalent of the condylar paths on extra-oral sagittally mounted, parallel plates. The HA is individually defined in each patient by the pure, rotating TMJ movement during initial mouth opening (no farward gliding of the condyles, incisor distance up to 10 mm). The parallel plates are placed in the TMJ region in the skull-mounted plate bow; both registration tips (''drawing'' the HA tracings on the electronic plates) are connected to the mandible by a face bow, paraocclusally fixed to the teeth. The face bow is individually shaped for each patient to allow mask ventilation and free movement of the laryngoscope during intubation. HA tracings are registered and calculated for both sides independently every 24 ms with the SAM/Klett system and presented on sagittal and frontal projections. In the operating theatre, the active mouth-opening traces (MOT) are registered first and the passive endotracheal intubation traces (EIT) after induction of anaesthesia (same head position). With informed consent and approval by the ethics committee of the Landesarztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz, 40 male patients (ASA I, Mallampati I, limb surgery) were randomly allocated to four groups (n=10 each). OS: Oral intubation, suxamethonium (1.5 mg/kg); OV: Oral intubation, vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg); NS: Nasal intubation, suxamethonium (1.5 mg/kg); and NV: Nasal intubation, vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). Intubation was performed 100 s after injection of the relaxant. Pre- and postoperatively (every 24 h over 3 days, in case of positive findings longer) recorded were: active movements of the mandible (maximal mouth opening/max. laterotrusion); dysfunction of the TMJ; and pain sensation in the TMJ (Helkimo rating).MOTs and EITs were recorded and analysed with the system described and typical EIT patterns were identified: bland, clinically uneventful intubations (n=7), massive distraction and laterotrusion of the EIT compared to the MOT (n=24), and blocked or limited TMJ movements resulting in intubation problems (n=1). With the method presented, TMJ movements could be visualised during endotracheal intubation for the first time. It can be used to assess techniques, routes, and instruments for intubation as well as to evaluate potential traumatising movements during endotracheal intubation.

In sports vision, Static eyesight, Dynamic visual acuity, Contrast sensitivity, Eye movement, Deep vision, Instant vision, Cooperative action of eye, hand and foot, and Peripheral field are have to be treated. In particular for the tennis, all of the items are very important. Furthermore, trajectory of gaze location and tennis racket stroke gives some instructions for skill-up of tennis play. Therefore, sports vision based tennis player training system is proposed. Through experiment, it is found that the proposed system does work well for improvement of tennis players' skills.

TI  - Terrestrial invertebrates in flooded grassland: A literature review
PY  - 2005
AB  - I reviewed information from 73 sources on soil animals in flooded grassland, focusing on soil macrofauna: snails and slugs (Gastropoda), earthworms (Lumbricidae), potworms (Enchytraeidae), woodlice (Isopoda), millipedes (Chilopoda, Diplopoda), Diptera, and other insect larvae. While the database on earthworms was rather comprehensive, studies on all other soil fauna groups, especially regarding their role in wetlands were few and showed major research needs. The survival strategies of the groups were compared systematically. Annelids and insect larvae had the best physiological adaptations, other groups only reacted with evasion by active or passive movement and by recolonization and reproduction from resistant stages. There were no typical "wetland species" in soil macrofauna, only tolerant hygrophilous species. Flooding of grassland immediately reduced diversity, abundance, and biomass of all groups of soil macrofauna. Their community structure was altered, and well-adapted species, often wide-spread opportunists, became more abundant while others disappeared. The effects increased with the duration of flooding and rising temperature but were usually compensated for during the next soil-dry period. A meta-analysis classified sites according to duration, frequency, and seasonality of inundation. In general, species numbers and abundances of earthworms, woodlice, and millipedes tended to be lower in frequently and/or extensively flooded sites. Only gastropods are favored by moderate winter flooding. In bogs, even when they are waterlogged the entire year, species numbers are distinctly higher than the most frequently flooded sites. The impact of episodic summer flooding events is transitional and less pronounced than that of regular winter flooding. Earthworms re-establish soil structure after flooding, and they are, next to dipteran larvae, an important prey for wetland birds. Slow, moderate flooding in winter, waterlogging in spring, and a landscape mosaic with non-flooded refuge sites is recommended for water management policies favorable for both soil fauna and wetland birds.

TI  - Test rig for the identification of rotordynamic coefficients of fluid film bearing elements
PY  - 1995
AB  - A test rig and measurement procedure to identify the rotordynamic coefficients of generic fluid film bearing elements are described. The test apparatus allows the exchange of test articles without modifications to the basic design of the machine. The maximum operating speed of the rig is 9,000 rpm, with static loads to 4,450 N (1,000 lb) and available fluid supply pressures to 689 kPa (100 psi). Impact load excitations in two orthogonal directions bring the test bearing into dynamic motion, and a data acquisition and computer system record the dynamic response at a frequency of 12,000 samples per second. Test bearing elements undergo multiple forced dynamic tests, and the corresponding time responses are transformed into the frequency domain and averaged. Bearing stiffness, damping, and inertia force coefficients are then identified from an impedance matrix in the frequency domain. Dynamic tests for an open ends squeeze film damper at various journal center static (offset) positions are presented for three levels of impact loads. In general, the identified damping coefficients correlate well with theoretical predictions.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of fMRI experiments during robot-assisted active and passive stepping
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Brain activity has been shown to undergo cortical and sub-cortical functional reorganisation over the course of gait rehabilitation in patients suffering from a spinal cord injury or a stroke. These changes however, have not been completely elucidated by neuroimaging to date, mainly due to the scarcity of long-term, follow-up investigations. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible stepper MARCOS was specifically developed to enable the investigation of the supraspinal adaptations in paretic patients undergoing gait-rehabilitation in a controlled and repeatable manner. In view of future clinical research, the present study aims at examining the test-retest reliability of functional MRI (fMRI) experiments using MARCOS.Methods: The effect of repeated active and passive stepping movements on brain activity was investigated in 16 healthy participants from fMRI data collected in two separate imaging sessions six weeks apart. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated for the metrics of motor performance. Regional overlap of brain activation between sessions, as well as an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed from the single-subject and group activation maps for five regions of interest (ROI).Results: Data from eight participants had to be excluded due to excessive head motion. Reliability of motor performance was higher during passive than active movements, as seen in 4.5-to 13-fold lower RMSE for passive movements. In contrast, ICC ranged from 0.48 to 0.72 during passive movements and from 0.77 to 0.85 during active movements. Regional overlap of activations was also higher during active than during passive movements.Conclusion: These findings imply that an increased variability of motor performance during active movements of healthy participants may be associated with a stable neuronal activation pattern across repeated measurements. In contrast, a stable motor performance during passive movements may be accompanied by a confined reliability of brain activation across repeated measurements.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of joint position and kinesthetic sense in the elbow of healthy subjects.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Proprioception is an important effect measure in neuromuscular function training in physiotherapy. Reliability studies of methods for measuring proprioception are few on joint position sense (JPS) and threshold to detection of a passive movement (TDPM) on the elbow. The aim was to study test-retest reliability of elbow-JPS and elbow-TDPM. A total of 45 healthy subjects participated in the study (mean age 33 years, range 18-57 years). In the active-active test-retest of JPS 26 subjects and in test-retest of TDPM 19 subjects participated. The duration between test and retest was approximately 30 minutes. There was no significant difference (p<0.05) between test and retest. The intraclass correlation coefficients, (ICC, model 2.1) of test-retest on absolute error were 0.59 and 0.69 for JPS and TDPM, respectively, indicating a fair to good reliability. ICCs of variable error were 0.45 for TDPM, indicating a fair to good reliability, whereas for JPS it was 0.007, indicating poor reliability. TDPM can be recommended as an examination tool for absolute error, but to a minor degree for consistency of error. JPS can only be recommended to a minor degree for absolute error, but for consistency of error it is not reliable and can therefore not be recommended.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of time-frequency measures of auditory steady-state responses in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) paradigms have consistently demonstrated gamma band abnormalities in schizophrenia at a 40-Hz driving frequency with both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Various time-frequency measures have been used to assess the 40-Hz ASSR, including evoked power, single trial total power, phase-locking factor (PLF), and phase-locking angle (PLA). While both EEG and MEG studies have shown power and PLF ASSR measures to exhibit excellent test-retest reliability in healthy adults, the reliability of these measures in patients with schizophrenia has not been determined.Methods: ASSRs were obtained by recording EEG data during presentation of repeated 20-Hz, 30-Hz and 40-Hz auditory click trains from nine schizophrenia patients (SZ) and nine healthy controls (HC) tested on two occasions. Similar ASSR data were collected from a separate group of 30 HC on two to three WA occasions. A subset of these HC subjects had EEG recordings during two tasks, passively listening and actively attending to click train stimuli. Evoked power, total power, PLF, and PLA were calculated following Morlet wavelet time-frequency decomposition of EEG data and test-retest generalizability (G) coefficients were calculated for each ASSR condition, time-frequency measure, and subject group.Results: G-coefficients ranged from good to excellent ( > 0.6) for most 40-Hz time-frequency measures and participant groups, whereas 20-Hz G-coefficients were much more variable. Importantly, test-retest reliability was excellent for the various 40-Hz ASSR measures in SZ, similar to reliabilities in HC. Active attention to click train stimuli modestly reduced G-coefficients in HC relative to the passive listening condition.Discussion: The excellent test-retest reliability of 40-Hz ASSR measures replicates previous EEG and MEG studies. PLA, a relatively new time-frequency measure, was shown for the first time to have excellent reliability, comparable to power and PLF measures. Excellent reliability of 40 Hz ASSR measures in SZ supports their use in clinical trials and longitudinal observational studies.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present description of a novel experimental facility designed and set up in KTH Cicero Centre for complete acoustic characterization of turbochargers. The facility is created to determine both the passive (scattering) and active (source) acoustic properties of automotive turbochargers. In this paper the currently most accurate experimental technique to determine the passive acoustic effect of the turbocharger is described. A detailed overview of the test-rig is given together with the mathematical procedures followed to obtain the acoustic 2-port data for turbochargers. The results, including transmission loss and scattering matrix elements, are presented for the compressor and turbine side of a typical automotive turbocharger working in a number of different operating conditions. The influence of the operating conditions on the passive acoustic effect of the device is studied and summarized. © 2010 by Heiki Tiikoja.

TI  - Testing imagination by projective techniques
PY  - 1950
AB  - Imagination is not mere passive perception of meanings. It is active creation. Thus the testing of imagination only is seldom the aim of projective techniques. 50 chance ink blots were shown to 100 middle-class adolescent males from 13 to 18 years of age. Those tested replied in either English or Kannada. The variation in the number of responses arose from certain significant variations in the responses themselves. Those involving projective techniques have in no case significantly exceeded in number those not involving the projective technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Testing of instrumentation for the identification of wax in a hydrocarbon pipeline
PY  - 2000
AB  - The present paper describes a summary of experimental work. Carried out at Heriot-Watt University, in support of a new philosophy, proposed and developed by R.S.T. Projects Ltd, whereby low cost instrumentation is installed inside a conventional bi-directional or foam pig. Two methods have been investigated.The first, more speculative, technique investigates how the pipeline acoustic response to an 'active' sound source is affected by the nature of an internal wax coating. Preliminary results from 'static' acoustic tests are presented which indicate that differences in wax coating (type and thickness) can be detected. Further extensive investigation is required to adapt this for a moving pig and develop the appropriate signal processing techniques. This method may constitute an effective means of determining the degree to which a line is coated with soft wax as the absorption characteristics are particularly effective in changing the acoustic response of the pig.The second technique used an on-board accelerometer to measure the vibration signal of the pig. The results indicate that the intensity and acceleration frequency spectrum of the signal may be related to the internal coating of the line. The condition of the pig disks may also be inferred.

TI  - Testing the use of molecular dynamics to simulate fluorophore motions and FRET
PY  - 2011
AB  - Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is commonly used to determine the proximity of fluorophores, but usually many assumptions are required to gain a quantitative relationship between the likelihood of energy transfer and fluorophore separation. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide one way of checking these assumptions, but before using simulations to study complex systems it is important to make sure that they can correctly model the motions of fluorophores and the likely FRET efficiency in a simple system. Here we simulate a well characterised situation of independent fluorophores in solution so that we can compare the predictions with expected values. Our simulations reproduce the experimental fluorescence anisotropy of Alexafluor488 and predict that of AlexaFluor568. At the ensemble level we are able to reproduce the expected isotropic and dynamic motion of the fluorophores as well as the FRET efficiency of the system. At the level of single donor-acceptor pairs, however, very long simulations are required to adequately sample the translational motion of the fluorophores and more surprisingly also the rotational motion. Our studies demonstrate how MD simulations can be used in more complex systems to check if the dynamic orientation averaging regime applies, if the fluorophores have isotropic orientational motion, to calculate the likely values of the orientation factor kappa(2) and to determine the FRET efficiency of the system in both dynamic and static orientational averaging regimes. We also show that it is possible in some situations to create system specific relationships between FRET efficiency and fluorophore separation that can be used to interpret experimental data and find any correlations between kappa(2) and separation that may influence distance measurements.

TI  - Testing visual perception of three-dimensionally moving objects (dynamic stereoscopy)
PY  - 1986
AB  - In the past decade, visual requirements in the field of stereoscopy have considerably increased in a number of professions, as well in present-day traffic and sports. As a result of a statement of the WHO (1984) viz. that for prevention of accidents the testing of static vision only is insufficient, and that dynamic vision too should be a subject of investigation, a test for measuring dynamic stereoscopic visual acuity has been devised. With the help of two synchronously rotating prisms, a stereo test consisting of four bars is transposed into an apparent circumduction movement which is presented at different velocities. Stereoscopy under static and dynamic conditions do not run a parallel course. Dynamic stereoscopy is significantly influenced by age, but not by sex. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr. W. Junk Publishers.

TI  - Tethered Magnets Are the Key to Magnetotaxis: Direct Observations of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 Show that MamK Distributes Magnetosome Organelles Equally to Daughter Cells
PY  - 2017
AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria are a unique group of bacteria that synthesize a magnetic organelle termed the magnetosome, which they use to assist with their magnetic navigation in a specific type of bacterial motility called magneto-aerotaxis. Cytoskeletal filaments consisting of the actin-like protein MamK are associated with the magnetosome chain. Previously, the function of MamK was thought to be in positioning magnetosome organelles; this was proposed based on observations via electron microscopy still images. Here, we conducted live-cell time-lapse fluorescence imaging analyses employing highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy, and these methods enabled us to visualize detailed dynamic movement of magnetosomes in growing cells during the entire cell cycle with high-temporal resolution and a high signal/noise ratio. We found that the MamK cytoskeleton anchors magnetosomes through a mechanism that requires MamK-ATPase activity throughout the cell cycle to prevent simple diffusion of magnetosomes within the cell. We concluded that the static chain-like arrangement of the magnetosomes is required to precisely and consistently segregate the magnetosomes to daughter cells. Thus, the daughter cells inherit a functional magnetic sensor that mediates magneto-reception.IMPORTANCE Half a century ago, bacterial cells were considered a simple "bag of enzymes"; only recently have they been shown to comprise ordered complexes of macromolecular structures, such as bacterial organelles and cytoskeletons, similar to their eukaryotic counterparts. In eukaryotic cells, the positioning of organelles is regulated by cytoskeletal elements. However, the role of cytoskeletal elements in the positioning of bacterial organelles, such as magnetosomes, remains unclear. Magnetosomes are associated with cytoskeletal filaments that consist of the actin-like protein MamK. In this study, we focused on how the MamK cytoskeleton regulates the dynamic movement of magnetosome organelles in living magnetotactic bacterial cells. Here, we used fluorescence imaging to visualize the dynamics of magnetosomes throughout the cell cycle in living magnetotactic bacterial cells to understand how they use the actin-like cytoskeleton to maintain and to make functional their nano-sized magnetic organelles.

TI  - Texture gradients and perceptual constancy under haptic exploration
PY  - 2007
AB  - Participants perceive a distal surface texture to be of a certain roughness despite being explored in different ways: by active or passive touch or at different speeds. Understanding the basis and extent of this roughness constancy is an important theoretical goal. The literature suggests that it may stem from how one class of cutaneous afferents codes texture element spacings. In different experiments using raised dot surfaces, we investigated participants' abilities to discriminate spatial density gradients of different directions and magnitudes. This was done under conditions where fingers changed and where performance over extended practice could be observed. The data confirm that perceptual constancy is a feature of haptic texture perception but we identify a subtle bias in perception and we find evidence that practice, even without feedback as to accuracy, can enable even subtle spatial changes to be perceived. We consider these data in terms of models of haptic texture perception and perceptual learning.

TI  - Texture information in tactual space perception
PY  - 1998
AB  - The significance of texture as a source of information in tactual space perception was studied using a linear positioning task. A spatial texture gradient, whose elements changed with position and distance, a homogeneous raised-element pattern and a smooth surface were used. Participants had to reproduce locations and distances on these surfaces under various conditions. In active conditions, participants moved their indexfinger across the surface. In passive conditions, the texture was moved beneath the indexfinger of the participant. In conditions with equal movement speed, movement speeds of criterion and reproduction phase were matched, in conditions with unequal movement speed, they did not match. The largest errors were obtained for the combined passive movement-unequal movement speed conditions. In these conditions, differences between textures were visible for signed and unsigned errors, indicating that textures may differ in the cutaneous specification of distance and location.

TI  - Texture perception in sighted and blind observers
PY  - 1989
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the utility of visual imagery for texture perception. In Experiment 1, sighted, early-blind, and late-blind observers made relative smoothness judgments of abrasive surfaces using active or passive touch. In Experiment 2, subjects compared vision and touch in the accuracy of smoothness detection, using a broad range of textures, including very fine surfaces. No differences appeared between the sighted and the blind, and it did not matter if touch were active or passive. Vision and touch showed similar performance with relatively coarse textures, but touch was superior to vision for much finer surface textures. The results were consistent with the notion that visual ceding of tactual stimuli is not advantageous (or necessary) for texture perception, since touch may hold advantages for the detection of the smoothness of surfaces. © 1989 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

TI  - Textures that we like to touch: An experimental study of aesthetic preferences for tactile stimuli
PY  - 2014
AB  - * Smooth tactile surfaces are preferred over rough textures. * The unpleasantness of certain textures increases during active (as compared to passive) exploration. * The slow stimulation of the hairy skin can increase the rated pleasantness of certain textures. We report two experiments designed to investigate the nature of aesthetic preferences for tactile textures in humans. In Experiment 1, the participants rated their preference for a range of actively and passively explored textures presented on their hands and on their cheeks. The results revealed that those textures that were subjectively-rated as smoother were preferred over those that were rated as rougher. Moreover, certain textures were disliked more during active than during passive stimulation. In Experiment 2, the speed of tactile stimulation was controlled in order to elicit vigorous responses from C-tactile fibers (present only in hairy skin), which are thought to play a central role in pleasant aspects of touch. The results revealed that textures were preferred when presented on the hairy skin of the forearm than on the glabrous palm of the hand. These results provide preliminary evidence regarding people's preferences for different attributes of tactile surface.

TI  - The "Beam-Me-In Strategy" - remote haptic therapist-patient interaction with two exoskeletons for stroke therapy
PY  - 2019
AB  - BackgroundWe present a robot-assisted telerehabilitation system that allows for haptic interaction between therapist and patient over distance. It consists of two arm therapy robots. Attached to one robot the therapists can feel on their own arm the limitations of the patient's arm which is attached to the other robot. Due to the exoskeleton structure of the robot, movements can be performed in the three-dimensional space.MethodsFifteen physical and occupational therapists tested this strategy, named Beam-Me-In, while using an exoskeleton robot connected to a second exoskeleton robot in the same room used by the study experimenter. Furthermore, the therapists assessed the level of impairment of recorded and simulated arm movements. They quantified four typical impairments of stroke patients: reduced range of motion (active and passive), resistance to passive movement, a lack of ability to fractionate a movement, and disturbed quality of movement.ResultsOn a Likert Scale (0 to 5 points) therapists rated the Beam-Me-In strategy as a very useful medium (mode: 4 points) to evaluate a patient's progress over time. The passive range of motion of the elbow joint was assessed with a mean absolute error of 4.9 degrees (absolute precision error: 6.4 degrees). The active range of motion of the elbow was assessed with a mean absolute error of 4.9 degrees (absolute precision error: 6.5 degrees). The resistance to passive movement (i.e. modified Tardieu Scale) and the lack of ability to fractionate a movement (i.e. quantification of pathological muscle synergies) was assessed with an inter-rater reliability of 0.930 and 0.948, respectively.ConclusionsThe Beam-Me-In strategy is a promising approach to complement robot-assisted movement training. It can serve as a platform to assess and identify abnormal movement patterns in patients. This is the first application of remote three-dimensional haptic assessmen t applied to telerehabilitation. Furthermore, the Beam-Me-In strategy has a potential to overcome barriers for therapists regarding robot-assisted telerehabilitation.

TI  - The "FraMo" System: A New Mini-Invasive Technique in the Treatment of Proximal Humerus Fractures.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fractures of the proximal humerus are relatively common injuries in adults accounting for 5% of fractures. Nowadays the most common technique used is open reduction internal fixation with LCP plates. The risks associated with open reduction internal fixation had led us to develop and apply a "hybrid" system, which is based on external fixation and closed surgery principles. This system is capable of stabilize up to 4 fragment fractures on different planes while conferring a strong enough fixation to maintain fracture reduction while allowing the patient to perform passive and active movement since the first day following the surgery. Our study group started on November 2009 until December 2015 and consisted of 118 patients with a mean age of 68.84±10.52 years for females (76) and 65.62±12.56 for males (44). Patients were classified according to the AO/OTA (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopedic Trauma association) Classification. In a few patients we performed mini lateral accesses to allow reduction of the humeral head and greater tuberosity. Shoulder mobilization was initiated from the first day following surgery. The external fixator was removed at 5 weeks with successive check-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months. The majority of type B and type C1 fractures had almost a complete functional recovery. Patients also, especially in the elderly, reported a good quality of life without pain during any range of motion. Our group of patients, after removal of the apparatus at 5 weeks following the surgery, had a mean articular range of motion with active abduction of 90 degrees and about 100 degrees with passive abduction. Postoperative CS scores at 12 months follow-up was 75,47±8.02. In addition there was also significant (P<0.05) improvement between preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale measurements (in cm), 7.67±2.70 and 1.71±2.08, respectively. This technique has shown good functional results with reduced surgical risks and complications that are typical of open reduction surgical fixation of proximal humerus fractures, is quick in execution and minimally invasive. Given the very good results of the study of this new external fixation technique has shown to be a viable option for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures.

TI  - The 11th Nerve Syndrome in Functional Neck Dissection
PY  - 2002
AB  - Objectives. Assessment of the incidence of shoulder joint disability and evaluation of the role of a personal postoperative physical rehabilitative protocol therapy in reducing pain and shoulder dysfunction and improving the quality of life (QOL) of patients who have undergone functional neck dissection (FND) associated with total laryngectomy. Setting, Design, and Outcome Measures. Sixty laryngectomees who had undergone FND were divided into two groups (A and B). Group A received physical therapy after surgery. Clinical evaluation was done according to the Constant modified questionnaire, including physical assessment of passive and active shoulder movement and information regarding patients' QOL. Bilateral quantitative electromyography (Q-EMG) of scapulohumeral muscles was carried out on all patients. Results were evaluated by Student t test and multivariate analysis to find out which variables were important in predicting pain and return to work. Results. Six months after surgery, the patients in group A had better results concerning passive forward elevation (P = 0), shoulder active motility (P = 0), pain (P < .001), working and recreational activity (P = 0), and score of Constant (P = 0) compared with the patients in group B. From a multivariate analysis of clinical parameters important in predicting pain, significant predictors (P < .01) were shown to be global shoulder active motility, active forward elevation, abduction, active external rotation, internal rotation hand to back, working and recreational activity, and score of Constant. Regarding return to work, a significant predictor (P < .01) was the score of Constant. Electromyography work-up showed deterioration in early postoperative periods and improvements in late postoperative periods. Conclusion: The post-surgical variable clinical picture of shoulder disability is related not only to the accessory nerve injury, but also to the secondary glenohumeral stiffness resulting from the scapulohumeral girdle muscles weakness and postoperative forced immobility. Physical therapy aimed to early recover passive motion and to avoid the occurrence of joint fibrosis has been shown to have a real contributory role in decreasing shoulder complaints and improving the patients' QOL.

TI  - The Acoustics of Word-Initial Fricatives and Their Effect on Word-Level Intelligibility in Children With Bilateral Cochlear Implants
PY  - 2017
AB  - Objectives: Previous research has found that relative to their peers with normal hearing (NH), children with cochlear implants (CIs) produce the sibilant fricatives /s/ and /integral/ less accurately and with less subphonemic acoustic contrast. The present study sought to further investigate these differences across groups in two ways. First, subphonemic acoustic properties were investigated in terms of dynamic acoustic features that indexed more than just the contrast between /s/ and /integral/. Second, the authors investigated whether such differences in subphonemic acoustic contrast between sibilant fricatives affected the intelligibility of sibilant-initial single word productions by children with CIs and their peers with NH.Design: In experiment 1, productions of /s/and /integral/ in word-initial prevocalic contexts were elicited from 22 children with bilateral CIs (aged 4 to 7 years) who had at least 2 years of CI experience and from 22 chronological age-matched peers with NH. Acoustic features were measured from 17 points across the fricatives: peak frequency was measured to index the place of articulation contrast; spectral variance and amplitude drop were measured to index the degree of sibilance. These acoustic trajectories were fitted with growth-curve models to analyze time-varying spectral change. In experiment 2, phonemically accurate word productions that were elicited in experiment 1 were embedded within four-talker babble and played to 80 adult listeners with NH. Listeners were asked to repeat the words, and their accuracy rate was used as a measure of the intelligibility of the word productions. Regression analyses were run to test which acoustic properties measured in experiment 1 predicted the intelligibility scores from experiment 2.Results: The peak frequency trajectories indicated that the children with CIs produced less acoustic contrast between /s/and /integral/. Group differences were observed in terms of the dynamic aspects (i.e., the trajectory shapes) of the acoustic properties. In the productions by children with CIs, the peak frequency and the amplitude drop trajectories were shallower, and the spectral variance trajectories were more asymmetric, exhibiting greater increases in variance (i.e., reduced sibilance) near the fricative-vowel boundary. The listeners' responses to the word productions indicated that when produced by children with CIs, /integral/-initial words were significantly more intelligible than /s/-initial words. However, when produced by children with NH, /s/-initial words and /integral/-initial words were equally intelligible. Intelligibility was partially predicted from the acoustic properties (Cox & Snell pseudo-R-2 > 0.190), and the significant predictors were predominantly dynamic, rather than static, ones.Conclusions: Productions from children with CIs differed from those produced by age-matched NH controls in terms of their subphonemic acoustic properties. The intelligibility of sibilant-initial single-word productions by children with CIs is sensitive to the place of articulation of the initial consonant (/integral/-initial words were more intelligible than /s/-initial words), but productions by children with NH were equally intelligible across both places of articulation. Therefore, children with CIs still exhibit differential production abilities for sibilant fricatives at an age when their NH peers do not.

AB  - Purpose: To systematically review various flexor tendon rehabilitation protocols and to contrast those using early passive versus early active range of motion. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library databases to identify articles involving flexor tendon injury, repair, and rehabilitation protocols. All zones of injury were included. Articles were classified based on the protocol used during early rehabilitation. We analyzed clinical outcomes, focusing on incidence of tendon rupture and postoperative functional range of motion. We also analyzed the chronological incidence of published tendon rupture with respect to the protocol used. Results: We identified 170 articles, and 34 met our criteria, with evidence ranging from level I to level IV. Early passive motion, including both Duran and Kleinert type protocols, results included 57 ruptures (4%) and 149 fingers (9%) with decreased range of motion of 1598 tendon repairs. Early active motion results included 75 ruptures (5%) and 80 fingers (6%) with decreased range of motion of 1412 tendon repairs. Early passive range of motion protocols had a statistically significantly decreased risk for tendon rupture but an increased risk for postoperative decreased range of motion compared to early active motion protocols. When analyzing published articles chronologically, we found a statistically significant trend that overall (passive and active rehabilitation) rupture rates have decreased over time. Conclusions: Analyzing all flexor tendon zones and literature of all levels of evidence, our data show a higher risk of complication involving decreased postoperative digit range of motion in the passive protocols and a higher risk of rupture in early active motion protocols. However, modern improvements in surgical technique, materials, and rehabilitation may now allow for early active motion rehabilitation that can provide better postoperative motion while maintaining low rupture rates.

TI  - The Application of Augmented Reality for Immersive TC3 Training
PY  - 2019
AB  - Military medical personnel are the first responders of the battlefield, where they are tasked with maintaining tactical objectives and making critical decisions for care that may determine if a ca- sualty lives. Having providers engage in realistic Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) scenarios can optimize the leadership, teamwork, tactical, and medical skills required to succeed in the chal- lenging situations they may encounter. An issue that instructors face when attempting to create engaging TC3 training scenarios is effectively simulating battlefield injuries on the standardized patients imitating casualties. While medical moulage offers a static visual portrayal of a wound, instructors often have to provide supplemental content to the scenario using verbal prompts about the patient’s injuries. Augmented Reality (AR), especially the recent boom in wearable AR head- sets, has the potential to revolutionize how TC3 training happens today. AR can provide a unique mix of immersive simulation within the real environment by overlaying dynamic virtual injuries on simulated patients. The AR field has seen billions of dollars invested for development and deploy- ment of hardware and software, which has been leveraged into many fields. While AR offers many opportunities for training improvement within the TC3 training, several challenges for integrating these technologies still exist. TC3 scenarios present complex environments for AR tracking and projection due to the many dynamics of the scenario. This paper will explore the technical chal- lenges encountered during development of a TC3 AR capability and discuss both hardware and software solutions for addressing these limitations.

So far studies have only evaluated the effect on trunk stabilization exercises but analysis of human movement patterns for active movement and passive movement did not. We assessed the muscle activity of trunk and leg muscle during passive and active tilt mode on eight tilt directions at tilt angle of 30Â° using 3-D dynamic postural balance training system. We performed experimental study on the muscular activities of trunk muscle about rectus abdominis, external obliques, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, and leg muscle about rectus femoris, Biceps femoris, Tibialis Anterior, gastrocnemius. As a result, muscle activation was different depending on the direction of movement and pattern. The results indicate that various patterns of spinal stabilization exercise system could be applied to an effective training of chronic low back pain patients.

TI  - The Basic Science of Continuous Passive Motion in Promoting Knee Health: A Systematic Review of Studies in a Rabbit Model
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose: To determine whether the basic science evidence supports the use of continuous passive motion (CPM) after articular cartilage injury in the knee. Methods: A systematic review was performed identifying and evaluating studies in animal models that focused on the basic science of CPM of the knee. Databases included in this review were PubMed, Biosis Previews, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and EMBASE. All functional, gross anatomic, histologic, and histochemical outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Results: Primary outcomes of CPM analyzed in rabbit animal models (19 studies) included histologic changes in articular cartilage (13 studies), biomechanical changes and nutrition of intra-articular tissue (3 studies), and anti-inflammatory biochemical changes (3 studies). Nine studies specifically examined osteochondral defects, 6 of which used autogenous periosteal grafts. Other pathologies included were antigen-induced arthritis, septic arthritis, medial collateral ligament reconstruction, hemarthrosis, and chymopapain-induced proteoglycan destruction. In comparison to immobilized knees, CPM therapy led to decreased joint stiffness and complications related to adhesions while promoting improved neochondrogenesis with formation and preservation of normal articular cartilage. CPM was also shown to create a strong anti-inflammatory environment by effectively clearing harmful, inflammatory particles from within the knee. Conclusions: Current basic science evidence from rabbit studies has shown that CPM for the knee significantly improves motion and biological properties of articular cartilage. This may be translated to potentially improved outcomes in the management of articular cartilage pathology of the knee. Clinical Relevance: If the rabbit model is relevant to humans, CPM may contribute to improved knee health by preventing joint stiffness, preserving normal articular tissue with better histologic and biologic properties, and improving range of motion as compared with joint immobilization and intermittent active motion.

TI  - The Behavioral Health Role in Nursing Facility Social Work
PY  - 2019
AB  - Types of compromised resident behaviors licensed nursing facility social workers encounter, the behavioral health role they enact, and effective practices they apply have not been the subject of systematic investigation. Analyses of 20 in-depth interviews with Bachelor of Social Work (BSW)/Master of Social Work (MSW) social workers averaging 8.8 years of experience identified frequently occurring resident behaviors: physical and verbal aggression/disruption, passive disruption, socially and sexually inappropriateness. Six functions of the behavioral health role were care management, educating, investigating, preventing, mediating, and advocating. Skills most frequently applied were attention/affirmation/active listening, assessment, behavior management, building relationship, teamwork, and redirection. Narratives revealed role rewards as well as knowledge deficits, organizational barriers, personal maltreatment, and frustrations. Respondents offered perspectives and prescriptions for behavioral health practice in this setting. The findings expand understanding of the behavioral health role and provide an empirical basis for more research in this area. Recommendations, including educational competencies, are offered.

TI  - The Brain Compass: A Perspective on How Self-Motion Updates the Head Direction Cell Attractor
PY  - 2018
AB  - Head direction cells form an internal compass signaling head azimuth orientation even without visual landmarks. This property is generated by a neuronal ring attractor that is updated using rotation velocity cues. The properties and origin of this velocity drive remain, however, unknown. We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues. Laurens and Angelaki present a quantitative model of how multisensory self-motion signals update the firing rate of head direction cells to maintain a sense of orientation in light or darkness, during active or passive motion, and during three-dimensional movements.

TI  - The Cat Is On the Mat. Or Is It a Dog? Dynamic Competition in Perceptual Decision Making
PY  - 2014
AB  - Recent neurobiological findings suggest that the brain solves simple perceptual decision-making tasks by means of a dynamic competition in which evidence is accumulated in favor of the alternatives. However, it is unclear if and how the same process applies in more complex, real-world tasks, such as the categorization of ambiguous visual scenes and what elements are considered as evidence in this case. Furthermore, dynamic decision models typically consider evidence accumulation as a passive process disregarding the role of active perception strategies. In this paper, we adopt the principles of dynamic competition and active vision for the realization of a biologically-motivated computational model, which we test in a visual categorization task. Moreover, our system uses predictive power of the features as the main dimension for both evidence accumulation and the guidance of active vision. Comparison of human and synthetic data in a common experimental setup suggests that the proposed model captures essential aspects of how the brain solves perceptual ambiguities in time. Our results point to the importance of the proposed principles of dynamic competition, parallel specification, and selection of multiple alternatives through prediction, as well as active guidance of perceptual strategies for perceptual decision-making and the resolution of perceptual ambiguities. These principles could apply to both the simple perceptual decision problems studied in neuroscience and the more complex ones addressed by vision research.

TI  - The Challenge of Low-temperature Sealing
PY  - 2001
AB  - One of the most difficult and frustrating challenges for mechanical seals is to function properly in low-temperature applications. The challenges are most pronounced with dynamic seals, such as rotating and reciprocating shaft seals, but there are often leakage problems and surprises even with seals that see only mild dynamic motion, as well as with truly static seals. This article discusses each of the areas of seal dynamics: dynamic seals, pseudo-dynamic seals and static seals. Spring-loaded shaft seals are the classic elastomeric seals used with either rotating or reciprocating shafts. Visualize a spring-loaded shaft-seal on a rotating shaft. Since no shaft is ever perfectly round, there is always some dynamic, radial movement of the seal. Many traditional O-ring applications are pseudo-dynamic. While the system is at steady state, the O-ring is a static seal. Based on the discussion of pseudo-dynamic seals, it becomes apparent that there may not be too many truly static seals. Even the most benign static-seal environment may have occasional motion or vibration.

TI  - The Charnley-Hastings bipolar prosthesis in femoral neck fractures - a study of dynamic motion
PY  - 2000
AB  - Fourteen patients who had a Charnley-Hastings bipolar prosthesis inserted for a fracture of the neck of the femur underwent a fluoroscopic assessment of the prosthesis while walking on a treadmill at an average of 24 months (range 8-48 months) postinsertion. This motion was compared with static weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing motion. The area of interest was the motion at the interprosthetic junction. Previous studies of this and similar prostheses had suggested that interprosthetic motion lessened with time, as the inner bearing stiffened up. However, in this study it was found that although the interprosthetic motion during non-weight-bearing abduction was in the region of 20-30% of total abduction, the interprosthetic motion during flexion and extension in gait accounted for 70-80% of motion. We suggest this can be explained by considering the biomechanical effect of sliding friction at the metal-acetabular bone junction during weight-bearing gait, as well as the impingement of the neck on the prosthetic socket during extremes of movement. The reported superior long term results of the bipolar prosthesis over its unipolar counterparts in femoral neck fracture treatment can be explained by the delayed acetabular wear due to reduced motion, and shear forces, at the prosthetic-bone interface.

TI  - The Co-ordination of Swimmeret Movements in the Crayfish, Procambarus Clarkii (Girard)
PY  - 1960
AB  - 1. Electrical activity recorded in the first roots of the abdominal nerve cord show bursts of activity which accompany rhythmic movements of the swimmerets. These bursts persist when a root is cut distal to the electrodes.2. Proprioceptive impulses have been recorded from the distal portion of these nerves during passive movements of the swimmerets. They have also been recorded in the connectives during both passive and active movements.3. Cutting all second and third roots of the abdominal ganglia does not interfere with the rhythmic swimmeret movements of the isolated abdomen. Rhythmic efferent bursts persist in first roots even when only a single first root remains intact in such a preparation.4. Intermittent bursts are also found in the first roots of a completely isolated cord but their pattern, frequency and phase relationships differ from those recorded in the same roots before isolation was completed. Such bursts are very rare in second and third roots.5. Stimulation of small bundles of fibres in the circumoesophageal commissure produces well-defined inhibitory and excitatory effects on the discharge of single units in the first roots.6. One specific bundle found in many preparations, when stimulated at 50/sec., caused a tonic retraction of all the swimmerets which then began to beat rhythmically and continued to do so when stimulation was discontinued.7. Intermittent bursts in the first roots took place with correct phasing during this stimulation even when the abdominal ganglia were isolated except for their connexion with the last thoracic ganglion. Again, such bursts were absent in the second and third roots.8. It is concluded that both the inflow from peripheral proprioceptors and intrinsic properties of the central ganglia play essential parts in the co-ordination of the metachronal movements of the swimmerets.

TI  - The Continuum Of Material, Structure And Space. Anti-gravity Architecture: A New Utopia For An Experimental Architecture
PY  - 1996
AB  - In the historical development from static to dynamic perception of space, there are concomitant changes in the concept of architectural style. Materials become lighter, structures more kinetic and spaces less bounded and more energetic. This paper is an attempt to examine the expression of movement in architecture, advanced concepts of equilibrium, and a new sense of weight, that would finally lead to a new concept of space expressing the essence of movement. Energy, is the basic element of this new language, since it is capable of articulating the emerging concepts of force and dynamic space in a new architectural form. This language will be an abstract element behind every design, where typical themes from static compositions, arranged on the basis of tectonic principles are

TI  - The Contribution of Visualisation to Modelling-Based Teaching
PY  - 2016
AB  - Both the creation of models and their communication to other people involve visualisations. These are, respectively, 'internal' (or mental) and 'external' (or public) representations, with the latter confusingly also being called visualisations. Perceptions by one of the five senses provide external representations. The modes of external representation of particular importance in science education are the: gestural, concrete, static visual (pictures, diagrams, graphs, mathematical and chemical equations), dynamic visual (drama, animation, simulation), oral and auditory. The skills and abilities that constitute meta-visual competence in the modes are reviewed in this chapter, for they enable the central element of modelling - the design and conduct of thought experiments - to take place. Consequently, the skills and abilities of both modelling and of visualisation are mutually developed and employed during MBT.

TI  - The Cortical Activation by Functional Electrical Stimulation, Active & Passive Movement
PY  - 2005
AB  - We investigated the activation of the cerebral cortex during active movement, passive movement, and functional electrical stimulation (FES), which was provided on wrist extensor muscles. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study was performed on 5 healthy volunteers. Tasks were the extension of right wrist by active movement, passive movement, and FES at the rate of .5 Hz. The regions of interest were measured in primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (SI), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and supplementary motor area (SMA). We found that the contralateral SI and SII were significantly activated by all of three tasks. The additional activation was shown in the areas of ipsilateral S1 (n=2), and contralateral (n=1) or ipsilateral (n=2) SII, and bilateral SMA (n=3) by FES. Ipsilateral M1 (n=1), and contralateral (n=1) or ipsilateral SII (n=1), and contralateral SMA (n=1) were activated by active movement. Also, Contralateral SMA (n=3) was activated by passive movement. The number of activated pixels on SM1 by FES (12±4 pixels) was smaller than that by active movement (18± 4 pixels) and nearly the same as that by passive movement (13± 4 pixels). Findings reveal that active movement, passive movement, and FES had a direct effect on cerebral cortex. It suggests that above modalities may have the potential to facilitate brain plasticity, if applied with the refined-specific therapeutic intervention for brain-injured patients.

The overall scheme, hardware and software architectures of the system were designed. The key technologies dealing with the embedded linux drivers and the applications based on QT were studied. Experimental results proved that the designed embedded control system is reliable, easy to handle, and can control the KRT to realize isokinetic continuous passive motion and isokinetic active resistance motion. This can provide the guidance for the design of embedded control system in similar medical devices.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Purpose: Study 1 developed the Assessment of Attitudes Toward Augmentative and Alternative Communication-2 (AATAAC-2) to assess adolescents' attitudes toward peers who use AAC. Study 2 used the AATAAC-2 to examine influences of familiarity with people with disabilities; type of AAC device; and various combinations of gender of rater, AAC user, and communication partner on adolescents' attitudes.Method: In Study 1, 194 adolescents viewed videotapes depicting adolescents using AAC, then completed AATAAC-2. Study 2 utilized 8 videotapes depicting 4 different gender combinations of AAC user and communication partner as experimental stimuli. Each gender combination was filmed twice: once with a static touch screen device, and once with a dynamic touch screen device. One-hundred thirty-six adolescents were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 8 videos. Participants then completed AATAAC-2.Results: Study 1 demonstrated that AATAAC-2 has adequate psychometric properties. Raters' responses in Study 2 indicated no main effect of device type; girls were more positive than boys; and familiarity with peers with disabilities was associated with more positive attitudes. No 2-way interactions were significant; 3-way interaction of level of familiarity, gender, and type of device used was significant.Conclusions: Familiarity and gender contribute to adolescents' attitudes; type of AAC device combined with these factors to influence attitudes.

TI  - The Difference between Active and Passive Exploration on Texture Discrimination Ability in Hemiplegic Patients
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the texture discrimination ability of correlated cognitive function by active and passive touch in hemiplegic patients. Methods: The subject were 15 hemiplegic patients with a mean age of 55.53. When subjects moved their fingers over the surfaces (active touch) and moved under the subject`s stationary finger (passive touch) displayed the same contact time as in the active touch experiments. Tactile task was used a set of five difference texture panel (10cm×10cm×0.5cm), and two conditions of three level (simple, complex, contrast). This approach was based on patterned, randomized texture panel applied to the fingertips for 30 seconds. The subjects ability to identify texture panel by means of active and passive haptic exploration was quantified by the cognitive exercise point to perform the tasks. Results: There was significant difference in sound side of active touch between low group and high group in the cognition. There was significant difference in simple task of active touch between 21 below group and 22 above group in the hand function. There was significant difference in discrimination task of both touch between 5 below group and 6 group in the Brunnstrom recovery stage. There were difference between sound side and affected side in the passive touch. There were also difference between active touch and passive touch in the affected side. Conclusion: The present study identify the haptic exploration method on changing cognitive exercise point in the hemiplegic patients. This results suggest that development training method on the recovery of hand function with hemiplegia. (J Korean Society of Neurocognitive Rehabilitation 2012;4:1∼9).

TI  - The Differences of Postural Disorders Between Supratentorial and Infratentorial Ischemic Strokes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Research Objectives: To estimate the differencs of imbalance and postural disorder in patients with supratentorial ischemic strokes (SIS) and infratentorial ischemic strokes (IIS). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Hospitalized care. Participants: 93 patients with ever first ischemic stroke, SIS 54 and IIS 39. Interventions: To analyze the differences of imbalance and postural disorder in patients with SIS and IIS, static balance and dynamic balance were performed by computerized dynamic posturogrphy (CDP). Romberg test was performed for static balance. Dynamic balance estimated by the limits of stability (LoS) for stability limitation. Main Outcome Measure(s): Center of pressure (CoP) trajectories were measured of sway length (cm), area (mm2) and velocity (cm/s) by computerized dynamic posturogrphy, BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, Rodez, France). Results: Static balance was not significantly differences between the measurements of CoP in SIS group and IIS group. However the measurements of CoP of LoS were significantly differences. The area of CoP of LoS in IIS group were more unstable during dynamic performance compared with the area of CoP of Los in SIS group. The areas of CoP of LoS in IIS group were moved longer to right side than left side and to forward than backward. There were no significantly associations with age, height, weight, Beck Depression Inventory, Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index, manual motor power test, Mini- Mental State Examination for Koreans, Korean version of Berg Balance Scale. Conclusions: There was more susceptible to balance and postural disorder during dynamic motion changes in patients with IIS. Therefore, theses results may require close attention to falls on a moving moment to right side and to forward in patients with IIS compared with patients with SIS.

TI  - The Dorsal Homodigital Island Flap Based on the Dorsal Branch of the Digital Artery: A Review of 166 Cases
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Soft-tissue reconstruction in the finger continues to evolve. This study reports reconstruction of small to moderate finger defects with the dorsal homodigital island flap and compares the results between the innervated and noninnervated flaps.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of 166 patients who had soft-tissue defects of the finger treated with the dorsal homodigital island flap (187 defects in 187 fingers in 166 patients). Mean defect size and flap size were 2.2 x 1.9 cm and 2.4 x 2.1 cm, respectively. When return of sensation was important, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve or the dorsal digital nerve was attached with the flap to restore neurosensory function. The main outcomes were static two-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the flap, fingertip pain, and joint motion.Results: A significant difference was found between the innervated and noninnervated flaps in two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, and fingertip pain. The dual-innervated flap presented better discriminatory sensation on the flap and a lower incidence of fingertip pain than the noninnervated and single-innervated flap. In addition, the innervated flap obtained better Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores than the noninnervated flap. For flaps harvested from the middle phalanx, the mean active motion arc of the distal interphalangeal joint was 69 degrees (range, 35 to 90 degrees). The contralateral side measured 73 degrees (range, 45 to 90 degrees) (significant difference, p = 0.041). Maximum amplitude losses of 15 degrees were seen in 10 percent of patients in the distal interphalangeal joint.Conclusion: The dorsal homodigital island flap is an alternative for tissue reconstruction in the finger.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - The Dynamics of Shadow: Architecture of Natural Light in Extreme Latitudes
PY  - 2015
AB  - While architecture is composed of static structural elements, daylit space is perceived as a dynamic play of light and shadow – ephemeral qualities that add depth, texture, and movement to spatial composition. Our perception of architecture is greatly impacted by the intensity and geometry of natural light, which creates dynamic temporal effects through hourly and daily shifts in solar orientation. While most designers can agree that the composition of natural light is an important design consideration for the functionality, experience of, and comfort within architecture, daylight is most often evaluated for its ability to offset electric lighting use and promote energy efficient building practices. Using threshold illumination levels, most industry-standard metrics are concerned with evaluating whether there is sufficient illumination to conduct visual tasks and tend to promote a ‘more is better’ approach to lighting design - favoring uniformity over diversity and composition. While this approach is useful for measuring illumination requirements and evaluating daylight autonomy, there are limited metrics for evaluating the compositional factors of daylight and tools that can illustrate the ephemeral impacts of light and shadow as perceived by the human eye. The authors will present new performance metrics that are being developed to measure the compositional impacts of contrast in architecture, as perceived dynamically over space and time. Using high-dynamic-range renderings of an interior space located at 64°N, the authors will illustrate the dynamic visual effects of light and shadow through a short film. This film will document the daylight dynamics in two extreme conditions: the summer and winter solstices, drawing attention to the impact of latitude on our spatial perception of daylight. This presentation will combine cutting edge research in daylight analysis with stop motion film to communicate the power of light and shadow in our experience of architecture within a dynamic environment.

AB  - Although the benefit of bimodal listening in cochlear implant users has been agreed on, speech comprehension remains a challenge in acoustically complex real-life environments due to reverberation and disturbing background noises. One way to additionally improve bimodal auditory performance is the use of directional microphones. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a binaural beamformer for bimodal cochlear implant (CI) users. This prospective study measured speech reception thresholds (SRT) in noise in a repeated-measures design that varied in listening modality for static and dynamic listening conditions. A significant improvement in SRT of 4.7 dB was found with the binaural beamformer switched on in the bimodal static listening condition. No significant improvement was found in the dynamic listening condition. We conclude that there is a clear additional advantage of the binaural beamformer in bimodal CI users for predictable/static listening conditions with frontal target speech and spatially separated noise sources.

TI  - The Effect of Cervical Taping on Neck Pain and Kinematics in Patients With Chronic Neck Pain
PY  - 2016
AB  - Neck pain is a common disorder, affecting 30‐50% of the general population annually, comprising approximately 25% of the patients receiving physiotherapy in outpatient clinics. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the neck, headache, dizziness, and pain radiating to the shoulders or upper limbs. Physical impairments associated with neck pain can include decreased cervical range of motion (ROM), increased fatigability, compromised strength and endurance of the cervical muscles, and impaired sensorimotor control. A variety of Physiotherapeutic interventions have been described for the treatment of neck pain. Taping is a passive technique, widely used for the treatment of sport injuries, muscle imbalance, and impaired neural control. Clinically, taping is used for neck pain in spite of lack of research regarding its effectiveness. In addition, the mechanism by which elastic tape application affects tissue and function is yet unknown, but various effects have been described such as the ability to increase ROM, facilitate muscles and proprioception, and decrease pain. A literature search retrieved only 3 relevant studies examining the use and efficacy of elastic tape on the cervical spine. Gonzalez‐Iglesias et al. (2009) conducted a randomized trial in whiplash patients, Karatas et al. (2012) studied the effect of taping in surgeons with cervical pain after performing surgery, and Saavedra‐Hernandez et al (2012)‐ in patients with mechanical neck pain. All three studies demonstrated short‐term effectiveness of elastic taping on pain relief and cervical ROM. However, all samples were small, of mostly young participants, and effect size was not described. Reported changes were small implying that further research is needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short‐term effect of cervical elastic taping on pain intensity, disability and neck kinematics in patients with chronic neck pain. Materials and Methods This study was a non‐controlled trial with a pre‐post test design and a single intervention group. Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee, the Faculty of Social welfare and Health Sciences at the University of Haifa, and from the Helsinki committee at Rambam Health Care Campus Helsinki Committee. Participants A convenience sample of 27 individuals, 13 males and 14 females, was recruited via electronic media. Inclusion criteria were (a) chronic neck pain (>3 months), with or without referral to the upper limb; (b) age of 18 years or more; (c) pain intensity≥ 30% on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Subjects were excluded if they had physiotherapy in the previous 2 months, known skin allergy to the tape, evidence for active vestibular disorders, medical conditions that may affect performance such as Rheumatic Arthritis, Diabetes Mellitus, neurological disorders, head injuries, lower limb pathologies, local or systemic infections, inability to communicate and provide informed consent, unstable fracture/dislocation, post‐orthopaedic surgery in the upper body or spine, and pregnancy. Following screening, each participant signed a consent form. Virtual Reality Assessment A neck virtual reality (VR) system was used to assess cervical motion kinematics by the protocol of Sarig‐Bahat et al. (2010). This system included off‐the‐shelf hardware and customized software. Hardware included a head‐mounted display with a built‐in tracker. Virtual environment software was developed using Unity‐pro software, version 3.40f520. Cervical motion was elicited by interaction with images during a video game displayed on the two monitors embedded in the HMD. All dynamic motion data was recorded during the VR session and analysed by the software in real‐time. During the game, the participant acts as a pilot flying an airplane. The position of the airplane was controlled by the participant's head motion. Yellow targets were displayed on the HMD monitors and the participant had to contact them within 5 seconds by aligning the airplane with the virtual target. Once the target was contacted, a new target would appear at a random location and the player's task was to move towards it. Based on this principle, the VR assessment included (a) evaluating cervical ROM, (b) cervical motion velocity, and (c) cervical motion accuracy during a smooth head pursuit task. Taping Technique Kinesio®Tex Tape 23 was used in this study. Two strips of tape were applied: The first layer was a Y‐shaped strip with 2 tails on 2 sides of the cervical vertebrae, placed over the posterior cervical extensor muscles and applied from the insertion to origin. The second strip was an I‐shaped approximately 20cm long, transversally applied over the C5‐C7 vertebra with a tension‐on‐base technique in a space correction technique. Study Procedure Patients were screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria. The physiotherapist performing the assessments and taping techniques was a qualified physiotherapist with 13 years of clinical experience in musculoskeletal physiotherapy and was a qualified Kinesio® taping practitioner. Each patient was assessed 3 times: pre‐ and 20 minutes post‐taping on day 1, and in a follow‐up assessment 7 days later. Following the subjective examination and completion of the questionnaires, an explanatory VR session was provided to minimize training effects and to reach a stable level of VR control. Patients were evaluated in upright sitting position, with the trunk strapped to the back of a rigid chair to eliminate thoracic motion. Calibration was performed at each session for each participant, as instructed by the manufacturer. Each VR evaluation took up to 15 minutes. Breaks were provided when needed. Following the assessment, tape was applied. After a washout period 20 minutes post‐taping application, the second examination was performed. No other physiotherapy procedures were provided. Patients were instructed to maintain the elastic tape for up to 5 days. They were instructed to remove the tape if symptoms were aggravated or if any topical irritation appeared. The third examination was one‐week after the initial examination and included VR assessment without tape application. A paired‐samples t‐test was used to evaluate the pre‐post differences in studied outcome measures. Two paired‐sample t‐tests were run: pre‐ vs. immediate post‐, and pre‐ vs. one week post‐taping. Significance level was set at 5%. Cohen's d was calculated to determine the effect size. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software, version 17.

TI  - The Effect of Dynamic and Static Core Exercises on Physical Performance in Children
PY  - 2018
AB  - The study aims to investigate whether or not there is an acute effect of dynamic and static core exercises applied to footballer children with 12-14 years of age on their physical performances. The experimental method with pre-test and post-test pattern and control group has been used in the study. A sampling of the study has been created from the athletes between 12-14 years of age and playing in a football team in a private school. A total of 48 students have participated voluntarily as dynamic core group (DCG, n=15), static core group (SCG, n=15) and Control Group (CG, n=15). Static and dynamic core exercises with 30-35 minutes and 3 days have been applied during 10 weeks to the study groups. Pre-test measurements of height, weight, vertical jump, pull-up, standing long jump, flamingo balance, flexibility hand grip strength and plank have been taken from child athletes before exercises. After obtained data has been applied in a computer environment, arithmetic mean (x) and standard deviation (ss) of DCG, SCG and CG groups have been taken and Paired Samples t-test has been applied for the differences between pre-test and post-test. Significance level has been studied in p&gt;0.05 level. According to the findings, static and dynamic core exercises of 10 weeks have exhibited significant differences according to the performances of control group athletes. (p&lt;0.05). In addition to this, it is observed that physical performance values of dynamic core exercises are better when compared with the group performing static core exercises. As a result, a contribution can be provided to development periods of child athletes with core exercise to be applied. Also, the fact that there are dynamic core exercises of movements within exercise program will affect strength developments much more when compared with static movements. It is contemplated that applying dynamic and static exercises in combination will affect their developments much more efficiently.

TI  - The Effect of High Versus Low Teacher Affect and Passive Versus Active Student Activity During Music Listening on Preschool Children's Attention, Piece Preference, Time Spent Listening, and Piece Recognition
PY  - 1986
AB  - This study was designed to examine the effects of high versus low non-verbal teacher affect and active versus passive student activities during music listening on preschool children's attention, paired-comparison piece preference, time spent listening, and piece recognition. Three-through five-year-old subjects (N = 94) participated in four small-group listening lessons and subsequent individual posttests. Through the use of a modified multiple baseline design, each of four treatment conditions, representing different sequences of instructional events, was replicated three times. All lessons were videotaped on a split screen showing both teacher and students. Data obtained through observation of the videotaped lessons indicated that high teacher affect was associated with higher levels of group attending behavior than was low affect, and active listening activities elicited similar or higher on-task behavior than passive activities. No significant effects concerning teacher affect during listening or piece familiarity were found in analyses of posttest piece preferences, time spent listening, or piece recognition, although some differences between older and younger children were evident. © 1986, SAGE Publications.

TI  - The Effect of Lifeguard Experience upon the Detection of Drowning Victims in a Realistic Dynamic Visual Search Task
PY  - 2018
AB  - Lifeguard surveillance is a complex task that is crucial for swimmer safety, though few studies of applied visual search have investigated this domain. This current study compared lifeguard and non-lifeguard search skills using dynamic, naturalistic stimuli (video clips of confederate swimmers) that varied in set size and type of drowning. Lifeguards were more accurate and responded faster to drowning targets. Differences between drowning targets were also found: Passive drownings were responded to less often, but more quickly than active drownings, highlighting that passive drownings may be less salient but are highly informative once detected. Set size effects revealed a dip in reaction speeds at an intermediate set-size level, suggesting a possible change in visual search strategies as the array increases in size. Nonetheless, the ability of the test to discriminate between lifeguards and non-lifeguards offers future possibilities for training and assessing lifeguard surveillance skills.

TI  - The Effect of Noise on Cortical Auditory Evoked Potential in Cochlear Implant Users
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose: Cochlear implant (CI) users typically complain of impaired ability to understand speech in noise. Previous studies indicate that the detrimental effects of noise can be measured by the change of neural activities. The current study examined the noise effect on psychoacoustic measures while at the same time used cortical evoked potentials to quantify the change of neural processing of speech sounds caused by noise. Methods: Ten adult CI users and fourteen normal-hearing subjects were participated in this study. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes in both quiet and noise conditions each during passive and active listening. Speech stimuli were synthesized consonant-vowels with 0 ms and 50 ms voice onset time (VOT). N1/P2 amplitudes and latencies were analyzed as a function of VOT and listening condition. Behavioral measures as well as a variety of speech perception tasks were conducted. Results: For good CI users, speech perception scores in noise condition significantly decreased compared to those in quiet condition for most speech perception tasks. N1 and P2 latencies became prolonged with noise masking compared to the quiet condition. However, unlike what we expected, attentional modulation of CAEPs was not revealed in noise listening. The P2 latency measures were correlated with vowel and consonant perception in noise. Conclusion: The effects of noise masking on temporal processing can be reflected in cortical responses in CI users. These results suggest that N1/P2 measures to VOT stimuli with noise masking may represent the change of neural activities in challenging listening situations.

TI  - The Effect of Osteochondral Regeneration Using Polymer Constructs and Continuous Passive Motion Therapy in the Lower Weight-Bearing Zone of Femoral Trocheal Groove in Rabbits
PY  - 2013
AB  - Remedying patellofemoral osteochondral defects using clinical therapy remains challenging. Construct-based and cell-based regenerative medicine with in vitro physical stimuli has been progressively implemented. However, the effect of physical stimuli in situ in knee joints with degradable constructs is still not well-documented. Therefore, we studied whether it was practical to achieve articular cartilage repair using a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) construct in addition to early short-term continuous passive motion (CPM) for treatment of full-thickness osteochondral defects in the lower-weigh bearing (LWB) zone of the femoral trocheal groove. Twenty-six rabbits were randomly allocated into either intermittent active motion (IAM) or CPM treatment groups with or without PLGA constructs, termed PLGA construct-implanted (PCI) and empty defect knee models, respectively. Gross observation, histology, inflammatory cells, which were identified using H&E staining, total collagen and alignment, studied qualitatively using Masson's trichrome staining, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), identified using Alcian blue staining, and newly formed bone, observed using micro-CT, were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. Repair of osteochondral defects in the PCI-CPM group was more promising than all other groups. The better osteochondral defect repair in the PCI-CPM group corresponded to smooth cartilage surfaces, no inflammatory reaction, hyaline cartilaginous tissues composition, sound collagen alignment with positive collagen type II expression, higher GAG content, mature bone regeneration with osteocyte, clear tidemark formation, and better degradation of PLGA. In summary, the use of a simple PLGA construct coupled with passive motion promotes positive healing and may be a promising clinical intervention for osteochondral regeneration in LWB defects.

TI  - The Effect of Passive Movement on Range of Motion in Temporomandibular Joint
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects on improvement of the range of motion in the TM joint. Methods: 26 subjects who have TM joint limitation were divided to passive movement group(n=13,21.31±2.95 years ) and active movement group(n=13,20.62±1.39 years). All of the subjects were treated 5 to 10 minutes per one time, five times once a week for 4 weeks by the physical therapist. The open bite and cross bite were investigated at before, during(2wks) and treatment(4wks). Results: In order to assure the statistical significance of the result, a Repeated measures ANOVA were applied at the 0.05 level of the significance. There was a significant difference in terms of the rates of open bite mean change in within-open bite effects among pre-test, post-test 2weeks and post-test 4weeks in each group(P=.029). There was no significant difference in the rates of mean change in between-open bite effects(P=.441) but interactions between two types of effects(P=.025) were statistical significance among pre-test, post-test 2weeks and post-test 4weeks in each group. There was no significant difference in the rates of mean change in within-close bite effects(P=.112), between-cross bite(P=.179) and interactions between the two types of effects(P=.098) among pre-test, post-test 2weeks and post-test 4weeks in each group. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that passive movement and active movement were effect on increase of TM joint ROM about open bite and cross bite.

TI  - The Effect of Patellar Taping on Knee Joint Proprioception in PFPS and Healthy Subjects
PY  - 2004
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception in two groups. This research was based on repeated measurement of quasi-experimental design and non-probability sampling. Active and passive angle reproduction and threshold were performed to detect passive movement on isokinetic dynamometer. After taping, evaluation of tests was repeated and it was found that taping could affect passive angle reproduction in 20-degree angle. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of patellar taping on proprioception status of PFPS subjects.

TI  - The Effect of Repetitive Passive and Active Movements on Proprioception Ability in Forearm Supination
PY  - 2013
AB  - [Purpose] This study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of repetitive passive movement and repetitive active movement on proprioception in forearm supination. [Subjects] This study had a cross-sectional design. Twenty-three right-handed healthy subjects were recruited. All subjects randomly received both repetitive passive movement and repetitive active movement (repetitive passive/active movement at 120 degrees/s with 60 repetitions over a 0-80 degrees range). Active and passive joint repositioning of all subjects was measured using the error score for position sense, both before and after repositioning intervention. [Results] In the repetitive passive movement test, there was a statistically significant decrease in the pre- versus post-repositioning error scores in the active and passive angle examinations. In the repetitive active movement test, there was a statistically significant increase in pre- versus post-repositioning error scores in the active and passive angle examinations. In the comparison of position sense, there was a statistically significant decrease in both active and passive angle repositioning error scores in repetitive passive movement versus repetitive active movement. [Conclusion] Repetitive passive movement improved the proprioception results for forearm supination, compared to repetitive active movement. Results of this study indicate that repetitive passive movement can be recommended to clinicians for rehabilitation therapy as it provides greater proprioception benefits.

TI  - The Effect of Stabilization Exercises on Playing Performance in Musicians With Joint Hyperlaxity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether a protocol with an emphasis on motor control techniques consisting of segmental cervical stabilization and neural mobilization have better results in mechanical reorganization and reduction of symptoms when compared with classic therapeutic exercise techniques in the conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Methodology: This was a double-blind, randomized pilot study for which we recruited 11 women with an average age of 54 (±6) years, allocated in classical Kinesiotherapy group or control group (CG) and experimental group (EG). A total of 63.6% were away from work. And 45.4% had completed elementary education degree. All volunteers had right dominance, and of them, 10 (90.9%) were diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, all being treated conservatively, with an average dys-function duration of 48 (±30) months. Randomization was performed in the presence of all patients and the physiotherapy team, using 15 envelopes distributed randomly on a table. Patients were directed to pick an envelope from the table in a random fashion, mark it with their name, and hand over to a staff member, without opening. Inside each envelope , the assignment to either the CG or EG was identified. Following the opening of envelopes, performed by a member responsible for allocation, the volunteers received information about the routine of intervention. Patients were unaware of the differences in treatment between the groups. To ensure double-blinding, the examiner was unaware of the composition of the groups before making final evaluations. The evaluation of sensitivity, strength, symptoms and function were performed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, grip and pinch dynamometers of E-Link Kit Biometrics®, The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) respectively. Patients performed the treatment program for 12 weeks, at a frequency of twice a week and duration of 60 minutes per session. All treatment protocols were guided and accompanied by 2 previously trained staff members (called "instructors"). Treatment sessions for both groups were performed at the same time, and on the same days, but in different rooms. All patients received a static splint neutrally positioned. The patients of CG received a classic therapeutic exercise program and the patients of EG received an exercise protocol based on motor control principles and neural mobilization of the median nerve and neuraxis. The data showed normal distribution and the Test T Student was used. Results: In the intragroup analysis, we observed a higher gain in grip strength and pinch for the EG, but this gain was not statistically significant. For most variables, the best results were observed in the EG, but without statistical significance. The effect size for objective variables measured by means of instruments was greater than in the variables measured by questionnaires. Conclusion: The proposed protocol group showed better results in mechanical reorganization, reflected in increased strength, sensitivity, and improved functionality when confronted the group with conventional therapeutic exercise, but without the same impact on reducing symptoms. Purpose/Hypothesis: Joint hypermobility is defined as an abnormal increase in the range of active and passive motion, which is a very common situation in musicians. However, its relation to injuries and on musical performance is not clear; it is thought that unstable joint can be harmed with repetitive playing task. Therefore, stabilization exercises can have a positive effect in hypermobile hands. This study is aimed to investigate the effect of stabilization exercises in musicians having hypermobile joints. Material and Methods: Seventy-five musicians who are playing string instruments and piano at conservatory were assessed if they have joint laxity, and it was found that 45% of this population had joint laxity. The ones who had laxity have asked if they would like to attend to an exercise program aiming stabilization. Twelve people accepted to do the exercises. These 12 people have been assessed by Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH). In addition, they are asked to rate their musical performance, fatigue, and pain according to visual analogue scale, and hand strength was evaluated with pinchmeter. Stabilization exercises were given for 4 weeks; once a week, students worked with the therapist, and during the whole week, they did home exercises. Ten people completed the exercise program, and they were evaluated again at the end of the month. Results: The mean DASH score (musician part) of the musicians was 25.12; this score decreased significantly (P < .05) after exercises. Also hand strength and musical performance increased significantly(P < .05). Conclusion: When treating a musician patient, if she or he has joint hyperlaxity, adding stabilization exercises to rehabilitation program can be useful. It is also suggested that musicians with hypermobile joints can do stabilization exercises to prevent their joints from injury and to increase musical performance. Preventive programs of musicians mostly include stretching exercises, however 1 or 2 stabilization exercise can be added for especially musicians with hyperbole joints.

TI  - The Effect of Visual Information on Young Children's Perceptual Sensitivity to Musical Beat Alignment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Recent work examined five-year-old children's perceptual sensitivity to musical beat alignment. In this work, children watched pairs of videos of puppets drumming to music with simple or complex metre, where one puppet's drumming sounds (and movements) were synchronized with the beat of the music and the other drummed with incorrect tempo or phase. The videos were used to maintain children's interest in the task. Five-year-olds were better able to detect beat misalignments in simple than complex metre music. However, adults can perform poorly when attempting to detect misalignment of sound and movement in audiovisual tasks, so it is possible that the moving stimuli actually hindered children's performance. Here we compared children's sensitivity to beat misalignment in conditions with dynamic visual movement versus still (static) visual images. Eighty-four five-year-old children performed either the same task as described above or a task that employed identical auditory stimuli accompanied by a motionless picture of the puppet with the drum. There was a significant main effect of metre type, replicating the finding that five-year-olds are better able to detect beat misalignment in simple metre music. There was no main effect of visual condition. These results suggest that, given identical auditory information, children's ability to judge beat misalignment in this task is not affected by the presence or absence of dynamic visual stimuli. We conclude that at five years of age, children can tell if drumming is aligned to the musical beat when the music has simple metric structure. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

TI  - The Effect of Watching Korean Traditional Dance on the Emotion  of College Dancer and College Student
PY  - 2010
AB  - This study was to investigate the emotional changes of college dancer and college student after watching Korean traditional dance, three static movements such as Salpoollee dance, Sanjo, and Hanryangmu and three dynamic movements such as Mudang dance, Seoljanggo dance, and Drum dance. Forty-nine college dancers and 54 college students were analyzed before and after watching static movements using PANAS(positive and negative affect schedule) questionnaires. A weeks after, it was analyzed again after watching dynamic movements. Paired t-test was used to examine the differences within experimental groups and ANOVA with repeated measure was used to examine the differences between experimental groups. The cronbach's α of PANAS questionnaires according to the subjects was 0.864. Watching static movements did not increase positive emotion in both college dancers and college students, but decreased nagative emotion(p<0.05). Watching dynamic movements showed the increase of positive emotion(p<0.01) and decrease of negative emotion(p<0.01). Watching dynamic movements rather than static movements is recommended to create positive energy in college dancers and college students.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Active-Passive Motion Therapy and Deep Breath Relaxation Technique Toward Pain Intensity of Patients with Post-Sectio Caesarea Surgery in Santa Anna Room Santo Vincentius Hospital Singkawang 2017
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Active-passive motion therapy and deep breathing techniques are non-pharmacological methods of pain management. This method can reduce pain intensity and without indication. This happens because it can control pain by minimizing sympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous system. Relaxation involves muscles and does not require exercise. Aims: To compare the active-passive motion therapy and which deep breath relaxation is more effective toward pain intensity of patients with post-section Caesarea surgery. Method: The research design was used quasi-experimental. The number of samples was 32 people. The sample of this study was undertaken by Accidental Sampling. this research was conducted at the Santo Vincentius Singkawang Hospital. Data analysis was using an independent paired t-test. Result: From the results of statistical calculations, the data obtained p = 0.041 (p = <0.05), thus H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted, which means that the active-passive motion therapy is more effective in reducing pain intensity in patients with Post-sectio Caesarea surgery. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the active-passive motion therapy was very effective in reducing the intensity of post-operative pain Caesarea. This study recommended that the active-passive motion therapy can be used to reduce pain intensity in patients with sectio Caesarea surgery.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Physical Therapy in Improving Psycho-Motor Skills in Children with Down Syndrome
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper presents a study conducted on a group of 13 subjects (7 males and 6 females), with the clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome, between 6 and 14 years old. The research was conducted between March and December 2017, the practical assessment consisting in applying the test "Clinical Observations of Neuromotor Performances". The specific objectives were to: increase the muscle strength and endurance; educate and rebuild the body image and scheme, the laterality, the spatial-temporal orientation and organization; increase the stability, balance, control, and coordination. The physical therapy programs consisted in: maintaining the acquired postures and positions and performing active movements during it, continuing the already known movements, using alternate global and segmental movements, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, therapeutic physical exercises during applicative tracks, improving stability, balance and perceptive-motor coordination throughout the strategy, going from static to dynamic balance, the subjects becoming aware of their body scheme, laterality and temporal-spatial orientation, improving their skills during their daily life activities. At the end of the physical therapy intervention on the Down syndrome patients, the initial psycho-motor deficiencies were diminished. After analyzing the results recorded by the entire group of subjects for the test "Clinical Observations of Neuromotor Performance", I observed that by using the physical therapy intervention, the "sensory perception" and "postural reactions" have improved by 4 points out of a total of 8, the "bilateral motor abilities", by 5 points out of 6, and the criteria "somatopraxis" and "other clinical observations" by 2 points out of 4. The great majority of the subjects have improved their neuro-motor results by over 80%, the smallest progress being recorded by subject 9 (an improvement of 54.8%), while the biggest progress, by subject 5 (96.77%). This reduction of the number of difficulties indicates that the subjects recorded a remarkable progress in regard to their neuromotor abilities.

TI  - The Effectiveness of a Hinged Elbow Orthosis in Medial Collateral Ligament Injuries: An In Vitro Biomechanical Study
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries are common after elbow trauma and in overhead throwing athletes. A hinged elbow orthosis (HEO) is often used to protect the elbow from valgus stress early after injury and during early return to play. However, there is minimal evidence regarding the efficacy of these orthoses in controlling instability and their influence on long-term clinical outcomes. Purpose: (1) To quantify the effect of an HEO on elbow stability after simulated MCL injury. (2) To determine whether arm position, forearm rotation, and muscle activation influence the effectiveness of an HEO. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Seven cadaveric upper extremity specimens were tested in a custom simulator that enabled elbow motion via computer-controlled actuators and motors attached to relevant tendons. Specimens were examined in 2 arm positions (dependent, valgus) and 2 forearm positions (pronation, supination) during passive and simulated active elbow flexion while unbraced and then while braced with an HEO. Testing was performed in intact elbows and repeated after simulated MCL injury. An electromagnetic tracking device measured valgus angulation as an indicator of elbow stability. Results: When the arm was dependent, the HEO increased valgus angle with the forearm in pronation (+1.0 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees, P = .003) and supination (+1.5 degrees +/- 0.0 degrees, P = .006) during active motion. It had no significant effect on elbow stability during passive motion. In the valgus position, the HEO had no effect on elbow stability during passive or active motion in pronation and supination. With the arm in the valgus position with the HEO, muscle activation reduced instability during pronation (-10.3 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees, P = .006) but not supination (P = .61). Conclusion: In this in vitro study, this HEO did not enhance mechanical stability when the arm was in the valgus and dependent positions after MCL injury.

TI  - The Effects of Cochlear Implantation on Vestibular Function
PY  - 2009
AB  - Objective: Determine the risk posed by cochlear implantation (CI) to the labyrinth.Study Design: Prospective cohort study.Setting: Academic tertiary referral center.Patients: Thirty-six ears belonging to 35 adult CI candidates (mean age, 46 yr; range, 23-69 yr).Intervention: Cochlear implantation.Main Outcome Measures: Vestibular function was assessed using the quantitative 3-dimensional head impulse test (qHIT), clinical head impulse test (cHIT), post-head shake nystagmus, caloric electronystagmography, vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, dynamic visual acuity, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory.Results: All 36 ears were tested using qHIT before CI, and 28 ears were tested 4 to 8 weeks after CI. qHIT showed that 1 of 28 ears had reduced function. cHIT was 44% sensitive and 94% specific for identification of severe-to-profound vestibular hypofunction confirmed by qHIT. Post-head shake nystagmus was unchanged in 11 of 11 subjects. New hyporeflexia was found in 1 of 16 electronystagmography-tested ears. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential showed either a disappearance of response or an increase in threshold by greater than 10 dB in 5 of 16 ears. Passive dynamic visual acuity showed no change in 16 of 16 ears. Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores worsened in 3 of 28 and improved in 4 of 28 subjects.Conclusion: Although small, the observed rate of labyrinthine injury was comparable to that for other risks of CI. Thus, it is important to educate CI candidates regarding possible risk to balance function, particularly when CI of an "only balancing ear" is contemplated. cHIT is useful for detecting severe high-frequency vestibular hypofunction and should be part of the pre-CI physical examination.

TI  - The Effects of Dynamic Visual by Students' Field Independence-Dependence on Learning with Multiple Representations: Focused on Connecting Errors and Conceptual Understanding
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study investigated the effects of dynamic visual on students' field independence-dependence on connecting errors and conceptual understanding in learning chemistry concepts with multiple representations.Seventh graders (N=123) at a co-ed middle school were assigned to a static visual (SV) group learning with text and static visual, and a dynamic visual (DV) group learning with text and dynamic visual. The students then learned‘Boyle's Law’ and ‘Charles's Law’ for two class periods. Results revealed that the percentages of the DV group were lower than those of the SV group on connecting errors. However, the percentages of the students' connecting errors were still high regardless of their field independence-dependence. There was a little different tendency in the percentages of connecting errors between the two groups by students' field independence-dependence according to the types of connecting errors. The scores of the DV group were significantly higher than those of the SV group in a test on conceptual understanding. However, there was no significant interaction between the instruction and the students' field independence-dependence. Educational implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - The Effects of Habituation and Gaze Stability Exercises in the Treatment of Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction: A Preliminary Results
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background and Purpose: The efficacy of both habituation and adaptation exercise interventions in the treatment of unilateral vestibular hypofunction has been demonstrated by previous studies. The purpose of this article is to describe the preliminary results of an ongoing study that compares the effects of these 2 different exercise approaches on outcomes related to vestibular function.Methods: Seven participants with unilateral vestibular hypofunction completed a 6-week exercise intervention after random assignment to either habituation exercises or gaze stability (GS) adaptation exercises. The following measures were performed pre- and posttreatment: Dizziness Handicap Inventory to measure the symptom impact, motion sensitivity quotient (MSQ) to assess sensitivity to head movements, and the dynamic visual acuity (DVA) test as a measure of GS during head movements.Results: After the 6-week intervention, there was an overall improvement in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, the MSQ score, and both the active and passive DVA. The habituation and GS intervention group participants each demonstrated similar improvements in both the MSQ score and the active and passive DVA measures.Discussion and Conclusions: The improvement in the MSQ score for the GS group and the improvement in the DVA measures for the habituation group were unexpected findings. Head movement, which is required by both exercise interventions, rather than the specific type of exercise may be the critical factor underlying the observed improvements in motion sensitivity and DVA.

TI  - The Effects of Hearing Impairment, Age, and Hearing Aids on the Use of Self-Motion for Determining Front/Back Location
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: There are two cues that listeners use to disambiguate the front/back location of a sound source: high-frequency spectral cues associated with the head and pinnae, and self-motion related binaural cues. The use of these cues can be compromised in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids.Purpose: To determine how age, hearing impairment, and the use of hearing aids affect a listener's ability to determine front from back based on both self-motion and spectral cues.Research Design: We used a previously published front/back illusion: signals whose physical source location is rotated around the head at twice the angular rate of the listener's head movements are perceptually located in the opposite hemifield from where they physically are. In normal-hearing listeners, the strength of this illusion decreases as a function of low-pass filter cutoff frequency, this is the result of a conflict between spectral cues and dynamic binaural cues for sound source location. The illusion was used as an assay of self-motion processing in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids.Study Sample: We recruited 40 hearing-impaired participants, with an average age of 62 yr. The data for three listeners were discarded because they did not move their heads enough during the experiment.Data Collection and Analysis: Listeners sat at the center of a ring of 24 loudspeakers, turned their heads back and forth, and used a wireless keypad to report the front/back location of statically presented signals and of dynamically moving signals with illusory locations. Front/back accuracy for static signals, the strength of front/back illusions, and minimum audible movement angle were measured for each listener in each condition. All measurements were made in each listener both aided and unaided.Results: Hearing-impaired listeners were less accurate at front/back discrimination for both static and illusory conditions. Neither static nor illusory conditions were affected by high-frequency content. Hearing aids had heterogeneous effects from listener to listener, but independent of other factors, on average, listeners wearing aids exhibited a spectrally dependent increase in "front" responses: the more high frequency energy in the signal, the more likely they were to report it as coming from the front.Conclusions: Hearing impairment was associated with a decrease in the accuracy of self-motion processing for both static and moving signals. Hearing aids may not always reproduce dynamic self-motion related cues with sufficient fidelity to allow reliable front/back discrimination.

TI  - The Effects of Motor Control with Active Movement and Passive Movement
PY  - 1999
AB  - Active movement is able to actively contract his muscles and move a segment either with or without assistance. This movement maintain physiologic elasticity and contractility of the participating muscles, provide sensory feedback from the contracting muscles and stimulus for bone integrity as well as increase circulation and prevent thrombus formation, in addition to develop coordination and moor skills for functional activities. Passive movement is the motion to the external force; gravity, machine, another individuals. Active movement is more activated rather than passived on the central nervous system. Therefore, we think that active movement is more effected facilitating through specific inhibitory mobilization of muscle.

TI  - The Effects of Repeated Passive Movement of Different Velocities on Knee Joint Position Sense in Patients With Post-Stroke Hemiplegia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of repeated passive movement (RPM) of different velocities on the improvement of knee joint position sense (JPS) in post-stroke patients with hemiplegia, thereby investigate the possibility of clinical application in the initial stage of rehabilitation for patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. Thirteen hemiplegic patients participated in this study. For the subjects’ knee JPS tests, a passive angle reproduction test and an active angle reproduction test were performed prior to and after the intervention, which involved 30 repetitions of passive full-range-of-motion flexion and extension exercise of the knee joints at randomized degrees of 0Â°/s, 45Â°/s, and 90Â°/s. Paired t-test analysis was done in order to compare changes in the pre- and post-intervention knee JPS. One-way repeated analysis of variance was used in order to compare changes in JPS after intervention at three different movement velocities. The level of significance was set at .05. The result was that the subjects’ post-intervention knee JPS significantly improved after the RPM exercise at a 45Â°/s and a 90Â°/s relative to the RPM exercise 0Â°/s (p<.05). JPS changes with RPM intervention at the rapid velocity of 90Â°/s were most increased, suggesting the most effective enhancement in knee JPS is with intervention at the velocity (p<.05). Therefore, RPM intervention at a half or higher velocity improved stroke patients’ knee JPS. During the initial stage of rehabilitation for patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, the efficient application of the RPM exercise at a half or higher velocity will be possible.

TI  - The Effects of Scapular Postural Control on Neck and Upper Limb Muscular Activities During Static and Dynamic Functional Tasks
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background and Purpose: The concept of shoulder postural control or “scapular stabilization” has been commonly adopted as a therapeutic exercise in physiotherapy for the management of work-related neck and upper limb disorders (WRNULD). The objective of the present study is to investigate the muscle activities of the neck and upper limb muscles, while individuals perform functional tasks with and without scapular stabilization. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects aged between 20 and 40 will be recruited in this study. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded while the subjects performed a 5-min static typing task and a dynamic forward reaching task - with and without scapular stabilization. The muscles examined were the right upper and lower trapezii, anterior deltoid, biceps, triceps, flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis. EMG activities and amplitude ratios between agonistic and antagonistic muscles are compared with paired t-tests in different tasks. Results: In the pilot trials, upper trapezius demonstrated significantly lower activity (p=0.045) with scapular stabilization compared to the condition without scapular stabilization. In contrast, lower trapezius showed higher activity (p=0.026) with scapular stabilization. Anterior deltoid and forearm muscles did not show obvious changes with and without scapular stabilization. This pattern was consistent in both typing and dynamic movement tasks. Conclusion: The results have provided evidence to confirm the influence of scapular postural control on the muscle activity in the shoulder and upper limb muscles. This may provide better understanding to the physiotherapists when using scapular stabilization as a treatment for their patients with work-related neck and shoulder pain.

TI  - The Effects of Static Stretching Warm-up Versus Dynamic Warm-up on Sprint Swim Performance
PY  - 2014
AB  - Recent research has revealed that static stretching (SS) warm-ups may attenuate power performance compared to dynamic protocols, but most studies have focused on dry land modalities. This study examined the effects of an SS warm-up versus a dynamic warm-up (DW) on freestyle sprint performance in competitive swimmers. Using a crossover design, 16 NCAA Division 1 swimmers swam a 50-meter freestyle sprint after two different warm-up protocols that were designed to mirror typical practice among competitive swimmers, while allowing any practically significant experimental effects from the SS versus DW contrasts to occur: Specifically, the warm-ups were Static Stretch + Swim (SS/S), and Dynamic Warm-up + Swim (DW/S). In each case the contrasting experimental warm-up exercises (nine static stretches versus nine dynamic movements) were immediately followed by a typical swimming warm-up (about 20-minutes). The timed 50-meter sprints took place 5-minutes after the SS/S and DW/S warm-ups, and they were conducted three days apart under simulated competitive conditions. In separate analyses there were no significant differences in mean times over the first 25 meters, the second 25 meters, or the overall 50-meter sprint time. Thus, in contrast to the effects shown in many other performance modalities, SS in warm-up did not attenuate performance in this study. It is possible that the swimming warm-up done subsequently to the SS or DW component may have blunted any SS-induced performance deficits. Thus, future research might vary the swimming component of warm-up to see if any effects of SS versus DW emerge. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

TI  - The Effects of Static and Dynamic Visual Representations as Aids for Primary School Children in Tasks of Auditory Discrimination of Sound Patterns. An Intervention-based Study.
PY  - 2018
AB  - It has been proposed that non-conventional presentations of visual information could be very useful as a scaffolding strategy in the learning of Western music notation. As a result, this study has attempted to determine if there is any effect of static and dynamic presentation modes of visual information in the recognition of sound patterns. An intervention-based quasi-experimental design was adopted with two groups of fifth-grade students in a Spanish city. Students did tasks involving discrimination, auditory recognition and symbolic association of the sound patterns with non-musical representations, either static images (S group), or dynamic images (D group). The results showed neither statistically significant differences in the scores of D and S, nor influence of the covariates on the dependent variable, although statistically significant intra-group differences were found for both groups. This suggests that both types of graphic formats could be effective as digital learning mediators in the learning of Western musical notation.

TI  - The Effects of Stroboscopic Vision on Drop Landing Kinematics
PY  - 2007
AB  - Introduction: Visual input is a crucial component in the control of human movement. Previous research using vision obstruction (blindfold) demonstrates alterations in landing neuromuscular control that may increase injury risk. Due to the method of limiting vision, these investigations lacked generalizability and sport specificity as the tasks were simple single movements without environmental interaction. The development of stroboscopic glasses that disrupt vision without completely removing it now allows visualmotor assessment during dynamic movements and target acquisition tasks. No research has yet considered the effect of dynamic visual stroboscopic interference on lower extremity kinematics. Purpose: To investigate the effects of interfering with dynamic visual processing on drop vertical jump (DVJ) landing kinematics. Methods: Participants consisted of twenty five NCAA Division I university women's basketball and soccer athletes (20.0±0.97 years, 180.2±12.8 cm, 78.7±16.3 kg). The participants were fitted with a modified PluginGait retroreflective marker set to track 3D kinematics via a Vicon passive optical motion capture system. A 5 minute warm up with the stroboscopic glasses was completed. Participants then completed 3 normal DVJs and 3 wearing stroboscopic glasses. The DVJ consists of leaning forward from a 30.5 cm plyometric box until falling, landing, and then immediately jumping up to a target set at 90% of their maximum vertical jump. Data were processed using Visual 3D software to assess peak knee flexion angles. Change scores were computed using the subtracted average of the normal landings from the stroboscopic landings. A one sample ttest, alpha .05 a priori, was used to determine if the stroboscopic condition altered knee flexion greater than 0 and greater than a previously determined measure of error of 3.2°(Ford, 2007). Data are reported as the mean difference [°]. Results: The stroboscopic condition altered peak knee flexion on the left (4.49±3.27°, p<.0001) and the right (4.22±2.76°, p<.0001) sides. Significance was maintained when analyzed for a difference from 3.2 for left (1.29±0.70°, p<.037) and right (1.01 ± 0.58°, p<.042) sides. Forty four percent had greater than 5° change in peak knee flexion, 20% greater than 8°, while 40% had less than 3.2° change due to the visual disruption. Conclusions: Stroboscopic visual interference affects landing knee flexion mechanics. While the relative overall group change in knee flexion was slight, the stroboscopic condition created a varied response in motor control. These results suggest that even a mild disruption to visualmotor processing can impact landing mechanics. : Presentation Preference (Complete): Unsolicited Podium Presentation (no more than 2 total per speaker) Awards (Complete): I would like to be considered for the PhD Podium Competition: Yes

TI  - The Effects of a Valgus Collapse Knee Position on In Vivo ACL Elongation
PY  - 2013
AB  - There are conflicting data regarding what motions increase ACL injury risk. More specifically, the mechanical role of valgus collapse positions during ACL injury remains controversial. Our objective was to evaluate ACL elongation in a model that mimics knee movements thought to occur during ACL injury. Eight healthy male subjects were imaged using MR and biplanar fluoroscopy to measure the in vivo elongation of the ACL and its functional bundles during three static knee positions: full extension, 30A degrees of flexion, and a position intended to mimic a valgus collapse position described in the literature. For this study, the valgus collapse position consisted of 30A degrees of knee flexion, internal rotation of the hip, and 10A degrees of external tibial rotation. ACL length decreased significantly from full extension (30.2 +/- A 2.6 mm) to 30A degrees of flexion (27.1 +/- A 2.2 mm). ACL length further decreased in the valgus collapse position (25.6 +/- A 2.4 mm). Both functional bundles of the ACL followed similar trends with regards to decreases in length in each of the three positions. Since strain would follow patterns of ACL length, landing on an extended knee may be a more relevant risk factor for ACL injuries than the valgus collapse position in males. Future studies should evaluate the effects of dynamic motion patterns on in vivo ACL strains.

TI  - The Effects of the Visualizing Strategy on the Achievement, Conceptual Understanding, and Learning Satisfaction: Focused on Hormone and Homeostasis
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study investigated the effects of static and dynamic visualizing strategy on the students' achievement, conceptual understanding, and learning satisfaction in symbolical conception learning focused on hormone and homeostasis. 39 students in the 10th graders at a high school in Busan were assigned to a static visualizing strategy group (Sv) learning with static visual materials(words and pictures) and 39 students to a dynamic visualizing strategy group (Dv) learning with dynamic visual using of macro-media flash program. Control group (Con), 40 students were taught by traditional method focused on the teacher's lectures. The results revealed that the scores of achievement, conceptual understanding, and learning satisfaction of the visualizing strategy groups (Sv & Dv) were significantly higher than those of the control group. Additionally the levels of conceptual understanding and learning satisfaction were significant difference between the Sv and the Dv. And the learning continuous times of the Dv's was shorter than Sv's. The visualizing strategy, however, made a positive effect on students' achievement, conceptual understanding and learning satisfaction in hormone and homeostasis. Especially dynamic visualizing strategy was useful in symbolical conception learning but needed to take measure for using depending on students' learning continuous times.

TI  - The Efficacy of Transverse Fixation and Early Exercise in the Treatment of Fourth Metacarpal Bone Fractures
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background Several techniques have been designed to treat fifth metacarpal fractures reported to be effective. However, these methods cannot be easily applied to the fourth metacarpal due to its central anatomical position. In this study, we sought to analyze the functional outcomes of patients who underwent transverse pinning for a fourth metacarpal bone fracture.Methods A total of 21 patients were selected and their charts were retrospectively reviewed. After fracture reduction, two transverse Kirchner wires were first inserted from the fifth metacarpal to the third metacarpal transversely at the distal part of the fractured bone, and then another two wires were inserted at the proximal part of the fractured bone. The splint was removed approximately one week postoperatively and the Kirchner wires were removed four to five weeks postoperatively. Patients started active and passive exercise one week after the operation. Pain visual analog scores, total active and passive motion, and the active and passive range of motion of the metacarpophalangeal joint and grip strength were evaluated.Results Dorsal angulation improved from a preoperative value of 44.2 degrees to a postoperative value of 5.9 degrees. Six weeks after surgery, functional recovery parameters, such as range of motion and grip strength, had improved to 98% of the function of the normal side. No major complication was observed.Conclusions We suggest that the transverse pinning of fourth metacarpal bone fractures is an effective treatment option that is less invasive than other procedures, easy to perform, requires no secondary surgery, minimizes joint and soft tissue injury, and allows early mobilization.

TI  - The Endangered Species Act: Static Law Meets Dynamic World
PY  - 2010
AB  - This Article looks at the discussion that preceded and accompanied the passage of the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"), focusing on why the law, including its implementation as well as its text, took the form it did. In particular, I am interested in why the ESA came to assume an unrealistically static vision of nature. The answer is complex. First, the Act's static structure is typical of law in general, which has traditionally embodied the human search for stability. Second, the Act is, inevitably, a product of the political times in which it was drafted and of a rapid and chaotic legislative process, which did not encourage thoughtful examination of the complex contours of the conservation problem. Third, it followed in part from incorrect but widely shared assumptions about the nature of the problem and potential solutions. Fourth, scientific understanding was itself in transition as the law was being crafted, moving from a focus on the tendency of ecological systems to approach equilibrium to one on the ongoing dynamics of many systems.

TI  - The Examination of Relationship Between Balance Performances and Some Anthropometric Characteristics of Athletes in Different Branches
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW) and height variables and static-dynamic balance of athletes specialized in different branches. Totally 160 active athletes (21,34 ± 2,58 years), 78 female (21,10 ± 1,63 years), 82 male (21,56 ± 3,23 years) who did not have any health problems participated in the study voluntarily. Biodex Balance System was used for balance measurement. Static equilibrium measurements were performed on a fixed platform and dynamic equilibrium measurements were performed on 2 different levels (levels 1 and 6). Normal distribution indicators of the data were analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Q-Q Plots and histogramgraphs and it was found that the data did not comply with the normal distribution. Spearman-Rho test was used for statistical analysis of the data. While there was a positive correlation between BMI, BW and height and dynamic balance values (Level 1 and 6) of the participants (p&lt;0,01), a significant negative correlation was found between BMI and BW. (p&lt;0.05). According to the acquiredresults, it can be said that individuals with higher BW and BMI values can achieve postural balance better but have more difficulty in compensating when they lose balance. It is suggested that individuals with long stature should do more balance trainings in order to be successful especially in branches that include dynamic movements.

AB  - Electromyographic activity of the teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles using indwelling bipolar fine‐wire electrodes was recorded during motion of the arm and shoulder without resistance, against resistance, and during static resisted activity. The teres major is active during static motion and during motion against resistance with medial rotation, adduction, and extension of the arm. It is not active during motion without resistance, although latissimus dorsi usually is. Copyright © 1971 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - The Functional Head Impulse Test to Assess Oscillopsia in Bilateral Vestibulopathy
PY  - 2019
AB  - Introduction: Bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) is a chronic condition in which vestibular function is severely impaired or absent on both ears. Oscillopsia is one of the main symptoms of BV. Oscillopsia can be quantified objectively by functional vestibular tests, and subjectively by questionnaires. Recently, a new technique for testing functionally effective gaze stabilization was developed: the functional Head Impulse Test (fHIT). This study compared the fHIT with the Dynamic Visual Acuity assessed on a treadmill (DVA(treadmill)) and Oscillopsia Severity Questionnaire (OSQ) in the context of objectifying the experience of oscillopsia in patients with BV.Methods: Inclusion criteria comprised: (1) summated slow phase velocity of nystagmus of <20 degrees/s during bithermal caloric tests, (2) torsion swing tests gain of <30% and/or phase <168 degrees, and (3) complaints of oscillopsia and/or imbalance. During the fHIT (Beon Solutions srl, Italy) patients were seated in front of a computer screen. During a passive horizontal head impulse a Landolt C optotype was shortly displayed. Patients reported the seen optotype by pressing the corresponding button on a keyboard. The percentage correct answers was registered for leftwards and rightwards head impulses separately. During DVA(treadmill) patients were positioned on a treadmill in front of a computer screen that showed Sloan optotypes. Patients were tested in static condition and in dynamic conditions (while walking on the treadmill at 2, 4, and 6 km/h). The decline in LogMAR between static and dynamic conditions was registered for each speed. Every patient completed the Oscillopsia Severity Questionnaire (OSQ).Results: In total 23 patients were included. This study showed a moderate correlation between OSQ outcomes and the fHIT [rightwards head rotations (r(s) = -0.559; p = 0.006) leftwards head rotations (r(s) = -0.396; p = 0.061)]. No correlation was found between OSQ outcomes and DVA(treadmill), or between DVA(treadmill) and fHIT. All patients completed the fHIT, 52% of the patients completed the DVA(treadmill) on all speeds.Conclusion: The fHIT seems to be a feasible test to quantify oscillopsia in BV since, unlike DVA(treadmill), it correlates with the experienced oscillopsia measured by the OSQ, and more BV patients are able to complete the fHIT than DVA(treadmill).

TI  - The Future of Biomechanical Spine Research: Conception and Design of a Dynamic 3D Printed Cervical Myelography Phantom
PY  - 2019
AB  - BackgroundThree-dimensional (3D) printing is a growing practice in the medical community for patient care and trainee education as well as production of equipment and devices. The development of functional models to replicate physiologic systems of human tissue has also been explored, although to a lesser degree. Specifically, the design of 3D printed phantoms that possess comparable biomechanical properties to human cervical vertebrae is an underdeveloped area of spine research. In order to investigate the functional uses of cervical 3D printed models for replicating the complex physiologic and biomechanical properties of the human subaxial cervical spine, our institution has created a prototype that accurately reflects these properties and provides a novel method of assessing spinal canal dimensions using simulated myelography. To our knowledge, this is the first 3D printed phantom created to study these parameters.Materials and methodsA de-identified cervical spine computed tomography imaging file was segmented using threshold modulation in 3D Slicer software. The subaxial vertebrae (C3-C7) of the scan were individualized by separating the facet joint spaces and uncovertebral joints within the software in order to create individual stereolithography (STL) files. Each individual vertebra was printed on an Ultimaker S5 dual-extrusion printer using white "tough" polylactic acid filament. A human cadaveric subaxial cervical spine was harvested to provide a control for our experiment. Both models were assessed and compared in flexion and extension dynamic motion grossly and fluoroscopically. The maximum angles of deformation on X-ray imaging were recorded using DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) viewing software. In order to compare the ability to assess canal dimensions of the models using fluoroscopic imaging, a myelography simulation was designed.ResultsThe cervical phantom demonstrated excellent ability to resist deformation in flexion and extension positions, attributed to the high quality of initial segmentation. The gross and fluoroscopic dynamic movement of the phantom was analogous to the cadaver model. The myelography simulator adequately demonstrated the canal dimensions in static and dynamic positions for both models. Pertinent anatomic landmarks were able to be effectively visualized for assessment of canal measurements for sagittal and transverse dimensions.ConclusionsBy utilizing the latest technologies in DICOM segmentation and 3D printing, our institution has created the first cervical myclography phantom for biomechanical evaluation and trainee instruction. By combining new technologies with anatomical knowledge, quality 3D printing shows great promise in becoming a standard player in the future of spinal biomechanical research.

TI  - The Impact of Arthroscopic Capsular Release in Patients with Primary Frozen Shoulder on Shoulder Muscular Strength
PY  - 2014
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of arthroscopic capsular release in patients with primary frozen shoulder on muscular strength of nonaffected and treated shoulder after at least two-year follow-up after the surgery. The assessment included twenty-seven patients, who underwent arthroscopic capsular release due to persistent limitation of range of passive and active motion, shoulder pain, and limited function of upper limb despite 6-month conservative treatment. All the patients underwent arthroscopic superior, anteroinferior, and posterior capsular release. After at least two-year follow-up, measurement of muscular strength of abductors, flexors, and external and internal rotators of the operated and nonaffected shoulder, as well as determination of range of motion (ROM) and function (ASES) in the operated and nonaffected shoulder, was performed. Measurement of muscular strength in the patient group did not reveal statistically significant differences between operated and nonaffected shoulder. The arthroscopic capsular release does not have significant impact on the decrease in the muscular strength of the operated shoulder.

TI  - The Impact of Dynamic Alignment, Motion and Center of Rotation on Myelopathy Grade and Regional Disability in Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy
PY  - 2014
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Cervical stenosis is a defining feature of CSM. Matsunaga et al proposed that elements of stenosis are both static and dynamic, where the dynamic elements magnify the canal deformation of the static state.We hypothesize that dynamic motion may be associated with myelopathy severity and neck disability and present novel methods of dynamic motion analysis in CSM. PURPOSE: To analyze the dynamic motion of the cervical spine and its relationship with myelopathy severity and neck disability. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Post-hoc analysis of a prospective, multi- center cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: 110 adults treated surgically for cervical spondy- lotic myelopathy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and Neck Disability Index (NDI), Short-Form-36 Physical Com- ponent Score (SF-36 PCS), Nurick grade. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter database of pa- tients with (CSM). 110 patients (34%) met inclusion criteria: symptomatic CSM, age over 18, baseline flexion/extension radiographs, and HRQOLs (mJOA, NDI, SF-36, and Nurick grade). The mean age was 57þ12 years with 41% female (n546). Correlations with HRQOLs were analyzed for re- gional and focal parameters in flexion and extension. Baseline dynamic pa- rameters (F/E cone relative to a fixed C7, center of rotation, range of motion arc relative to the COR) were also analyzed for correlations to HRQOLs. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean HRQOLs demonstrated disability and the mean radiographic parameters demonstrated sagittal malalignment. Among regional parameters, there was a significant correlation between in- creased C2-C7 angle in flexion and Nurick grade (R50.189, p 0.048) with no significant correlations in extension (Fig 1). Focal parameters including C7 slip were significantly correlated with disability (Flex R5-0.377, p 0.003; Ext R5-0.261, p 0.027). Reduced flexion/extension motion cones, a more posterior center of rotation, and smaller range of motion correlated with worse HRQOLs CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic motion analysis may play an important role in understanding CSM. Focal parameters demonstrated a significant corre- lation with worse HRQOLs, especially C7 slip, in flexion and extension. Novel methods of motion analysis demonstrated reduced motion cones correlated with worse myelopathy grades. More posterior center of rotation and smaller range of motion were both correlated with worse general health scores (PCS & Nurick). FDA DEVICE/DRUG STATUS: This abstract does not discuss or include any applicable devices or drugs.

TI  - The Impact of Dynamic Presentation Format on Consumer Preferences for Hedonic Products and Services
PY  - 2015
AB  - Manufacturers and online retailers are readily availing themselves of new technologies to present their merchandise using a variety of formats, including static (still image) and dynamic (video) portrayal. Building on vividness theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that presenting products and services using a dynamic visual format enhances consumer preference for hedonic options and willingness to pay for those options. The dynamic presentation format increases involvement with the product/service experience in a manner presumably similar to that of the actual product experience. The result is an increased preference for and valuation of hedonic options. This holds true for experiential and search products in single and joint evaluations and carries over to subsequent choices. Across all studies, the results demonstrate that a dynamic (relative to static) presentation format enhances choice of the hedonically superior (vs. utilitarian-superior) option by more than 79%.

TI  - The Impact of Musicianship on the Cortical Mechanisms Related to Separating Speech from Background Noise
PY  - 2015
AB  - Musicians have enhanced auditory processing abilities. In some studies, these abilities are paralleled by an improved understanding of speech in noisy environments, partially due to more robust encoding of speech signals in noise at the level of the brainstem. Little is known about the impact of musicianship on attention-dependent cortical activity related to lexical access during a speech-in-noise task. To address this issue, we presented musicians and nonmusicians with single words mixed with three levels of background noise, across two conditions, while monitoring electrical brain activity. In the active condition, listeners repeated the words aloud, and in the passive condition, they ignored the words and watched a silent film. When background noise was most intense, musicians repeated more words correctly compared with nonmusicians. Auditory evoked responses were attenuated and delayed with the addition of background noise. In musicians, P1 amplitude was marginally enhanced during active listening and was related to task performance in the most difficult listening condition. By comparing ERPs from the active and passive conditions, we isolated an N400 related to lexical access. The amplitude of the N400 was not influenced by the level of background noise in musicians, whereas N400 amplitude increased with the level of background noise in nonmusicians. In nonmusicians, the increase in N400 amplitude was related to a reduction in task performance. In musicians only, there was a rightward shift of the sources contributing to the N400 as the level of background noise increased. This pattern of results supports the hypothesis that encoding of speech in noise is more robust in musicians and suggests that this facilitates lexical access. Moreover, the shift in sources suggests that musicians, to a greater extent than nonmusicians, may increasingly rely on acoustic cues to understand speech in noise.

TI  - The Impact of Ocean Sound Dynamics on Estimates of Signal Detection Range
PY  - 2015
AB  - This work examines the impact of the dynamic soundscape on estimates of the signal detection area (DA) of passive acoustic monitoring stations. The range of signal detection was investigated at three site locations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System (CTBTO IMS). Transmission loss to each hydrophone was computed using the OASIS Peregrine parabolic equation model for a source within the upper 300 m of the water column to be consistent with the hypothesized location of vocalizing baleen whales. Seasonal, monthly, and daily soundscape measurements were incorporated into the sonar equation to estimate the variability in signal DA as a function of sound level and time As a comparison, the seasonal analysis was repeated with a constant noise level to quantify the extent of variability due solely to changes in the seasonal sound speed profile. The greatest DA variability was observed at the Wake Island location in the Pacific Ocean where only a maximum of 18% of the 71 to 85% difference in DA estimates across seasons was attributable to changes in the sound speed profile. Differences in the daily DA estimate distributions as a function of frequency and location illustrate the impact of local sound field dynamics on the overall soundscape and the resulting signal detection range.

TI  - The Impact of the Electronic Skin Substrate on the Robotic Tactile Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - The tactile sensing is of significant interest for coexisting-cooperative-cognitive robots (Tri-Co robots). In order to improve the tactile sensing performance of the robot via an electronic skin (e-skin), an auxiliary elastomeric substrate is required. This paper investigates the effect of the substrate including elastic modulus, thickness and location on the static sensing at first. It is found that thick substrate with small elastic modulus can even the force distribution effectively and improve the contact area sensing. But it brought noises and crosstalk on the e-skin when the substrate has the large deformation. In occasions of dynamic tactile sensing, the impact of substrate thickness and elastic modulus was also studied and it is found that smaller elastic modulus can help e-skin sense larger and higher frequency stimulus. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

TI  - The Importance of Active Exploration, Optical Flow, and Task Alignment for Spatial Learning in Desktop 3D Environments
PY  - 2010
AB  - Arguments for the use of interactive 3D simulations in education and training depend to a large extent on an implicit assumption that a more accurate and complete spatial cognitive model can be formed through active user-controlled exploration of such an environment than from viewing an equivalent animation. There is a similar implicit assumption that the viewing of animated view changes provides advantages over the viewing of static images due to the value of optical flow. The results to date, however, do not clearly support these assumptions. In particular, the findings of Peruch, Vercher, and Gauthier (1995) and Christou and Bulthoff (1999) conflict in relation to the importance of active exploration and of optical flow. This article reports the results of two studies exploring the importance of active exploration and of optical flow for spatial learning in 3D environments. The results indicate that active exploration can provide greater spatial learning than viewing of animations, but only if there is an alignment between the task goals during this exploration and the spatial learning being tested. In addition, the results suggest that a set of well-chosen static views of the environment can in some cases allow the formation of as complete a spatial cognitive model as a set of animated views. The article concludes with an analysis of the methodologies used by Peruch et al. and by Christou and Bulthoff in light of the findings reported here, leading to a new explanation for their conflicting results.

TI  - The Importance of Measuring Dynamic Visual Acuity
PY  - 2013
AB  - In their everyday life, people interact with different objects, static as well as those in motion. However, dynamic acuity is rarely checked in medical examinations, even those preceding the issue of driving license. In order for driving to be safe, good eyesight or good correction with visual aids is imperative. Beside good eyesight, drivers also have to have good reflexes and short reaction span. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic and static visual acuity in order to observe how they vary among individuals. Twenty female and male participants, 65 years of age, took part in the study and the comparison was made with the results provided by 20 20-year old participants. Dynamic acuity was tested using the Landolt-ring optotype which was simulating movement velocity of 72 km/h. T-test demonstrated the presence of a statistically significant difference between dynamic and static acuity among the participants from 62 to 68 years of age (t=15.852; df=39; p<0.01). Within the same group, dynamic acuity (mean=0.887; std. deviation=0.297) proved to be significantly worse than static acuity (mean=1.40; std. deviation=0.317). By comparing the results measured within the older group of participants with those measured in the younger group, it was shown that there exists a statistically significant difference (t=0.275; df=58; p<0,05) between the older and younger group in their dynamic binocular acuity with correction. Younger participants had better dynamic binocular acuity with correction (mean=1.063; std. deviation=0.259) than the older participants (mean=0.884; std. deviation=0.298). The differences between dynamic and static acuity and its degradation in the older age groups have to be taken into account when issuing driving licenses. The future of research lies within the study of correlation between the age and acuity in order that the results can be applied in practice.

TI  - The Independent and Interactive Effects of Navicular Drop and Quadriceps Angle on Neuromuscular Responses to a Weight-Bearing Perturbation/COMMENTARY/AUTHORS' RESPONSE
PY  - 2006
AB  - Little is known about the effects of static alignment on neuromuscular control of the knee during dynamic motion. To evaluate the isolated and combined effects of quadriceps angle (QA) and navicular drop (ND) on neuromuscular responses to a weight-bearing perturbation. Mixed-model, repeated-measures design. Sports medicine and athletic training research laboratory. Seventy-nine National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate female athletes, classified with below-average ND and QA (LND-LQA); below-average ND and above-average QA (LND-HQA); above-average ND and below-average QA (HND-LQA); or above-average ND and QA (HND-HQA). A lower extremity perturbation device produced a forward and either internal or external rotation of the trunk and femur on the weight-bearing tibia to evoke a reflex response. Neuromuscular responses were examined in the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles: preperturbation amplitude 50 milliseconds before the perturbation, reflex time, and postperturbation amplitude 150 milliseconds immediately postperturbation. Navicular drop had the greatest effect on preperturbation amplitude of the lateral hamstrings and postperturbation amplitude of all muscles, with greater activation amplitude noted in subjects in the HND classifications. Quadriceps angle primarily affected reflex time of the quadriceps; in subjects with LQA, reflex time was faster for internal rotation than external rotation perturbations. The interaction between ND and QA had the greatest effect on reflex time of the lateral hamstrings. For internal rotation perturbations, subjects in the LND classifications had faster reflex times in the lateral hamstrings if they had HQA values rather than LQA values. With external rotation perturbations, HND-LQA subjects had slower reflex times than those in all other alignment classifications. Navicular drop and QA have both independent and interactive effects on neuromuscular responses to a weight-bearing, rotational perturbation. These interactive effects highlight the importance of considering the entire lower extremity posture rather than a single alignment characteristic, given the potential for one alignment factor to compensate for or interact with another.

TI  - The Industrial District: A Stage of a Diffuse Industrialization Process—The Case of Roanne
PY  - 1994
AB  - The industrial district is an important element of the theoretical debates concerning the appearance of original features of regional development in Europe. Issuing from Marshallian theory, this concept was ‘reinvented’ in the late 1970s in order to interpret a series of ‘regional success stories’ of industrial development that occurred in middle Italy. Thus, for some economists and geographers, the industrial district has become a new ‘standard’ of regional development, appearing as an autonomous integrated system, whose functions are based on the principle of ‘autocreation’ This system represents an optimal structure in terms of economic efficiency and resource allocation, and owns its proper mechanisms of reproduction related to specific territorial regulations. A crisis for such a system can only be related to exogenous factors. Rejecting this static vision of economic structures, which reintroduces the ‘growth/crisis’ divide in the analysis of economic development, it seems necessary to promote a more dynamic approach in terms of ‘change through continuity’. This approach was initially developed by some Italian authors who tried to analyze the original features of regional development in the Third Italy in terms of ‘industrialization without fracture’. This approach does not deny the existence of industrial districts but refuses to accept that they are static: districts can evolve, change, develop … Thus, they appear as a particular stage of development in a diffuse industrialization process. Their evolution is no longer simply related to exogenous variables but also to endogenous ones; and this evolution does not necessarily lead to an implosion or a complete transformation of space but can also lead, through the continuity of the industrial district's mechanisms, to a post-district organizational configuration. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The Inferential Language Comprehension (iLC) Framework: Supporting Children's Comprehension of Visual Narratives
PY  - 2019
AB  - We present an integrated theoretical framework guiding the use of visual narratives in educational settings. We focus specifically on the use of static and dynamic visual narratives to teach and assess inference skills in young children and discuss evidence to support the efficacy of this approach. In doing so, first we review the basis of the integrated framework, which builds on major findings of cognitive, developmental, and language research highlighting that (a) inference skills can be developed in non-reading contexts using different media, (b) inference skills can transfer across different media, and (c) inference skills can be improved using questioning that includes scaffolding and specific feedback. Second, we review instructional and assessment approaches that align with the proposed framework; these approaches are designed to teach or assess inference making skills using visual narratives and interactive questioning. In this context, we discuss how these approaches leverage the unique affordances of static and dynamic visual narratives with respect to unit of meaning (by increasing opportunities to generate inferences), multimodality (by providing opportunities to generate inferences of higher complexity than text), and vocabulary/knowledge demands (by providing vocabulary/knowledge support), while also reviewing evidence for their usability, feasibility, and efficacy to improve educational outcomes. We conclude with important theoretical and practical questions about future work in this area.

TI  - The Influence of Motor Task on Tactile Suppression During Action
PY  - 2016
AB  - Movement of a limb substantially decreases the intensity and sensitivity with which tactile stimuli on that limb are perceived. This movement-related tactile suppression likely interferes with performance in motor tasks that require the precise evaluation of tactile feedback, such as the adjustment of grip forces during grasping. Therefore, we hypothesise that suppression might be stronger for stimuli that are irrelevant to successful performance in a given motor task. To test this hypothesis, we measured participants' perception of tactile intensity while performing different motor tasks. We investigated perception of both suprathreshold stimuli (Exp. 1: intensity discrimination) and of stimuli close to the detection threshold (Exp. 2: detection). We compared tactile perception between two grasping conditions (active, tactile inputs relevant), a condition where participants pointed in the air (active, tactile inputs irrelevant) and a static condition (baseline). In both experiments, we observed tactile suppression in all three movement conditions but not the predicted attenuation of tactile suppression in the grasp conditions. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was even an amplification of tactile suppression in the grasping conditions of Exp. 1, which might be related to the movement velocity. In conclusion, we did not find evidence that motor tasks modulate the strength of tactile suppression. Our results further suggest that it is important to control for possibly confounding variables, such as movement velocity and laterality, in this line of research.

TI  - The Interaction of Pre-programmed Eye Movements With the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) works to stabilize gaze during unexpected head movements. However, even subjects who lack a VOR (e.g., vestibulopathic patients) can achieve gaze stability during planned head movements by using pre-programmed eye movements (PPEM). The extent to which PPEM are used by healthy intact subjects and how they interact with the VOR is still unclear. We propose a model of gaze stabilization which makes several claims: (1) the VOR provides ocular stability during unexpected (i.e., passive) head movements; (2) PPEM are used by both healthy and vestibulopathic subjects during planned (i.e., active) head movements; and (3) when a passive perturbation interrupts an active headmovement in intact animals (i.e., combined passive and active headmovement) the VOR works with PPEM to provide compensation. First, we show how our model can reconcile some seemingly conflicting findings in earlier literature. We then test the above-mentioned predictions against data we collected from both healthy and vestibular-lesioned guinea pigs. We found that (1) vestibular-lesioned animals showed a dramatic decrease in compensatory eye movements during passive head movements, (2) both populations showed improved ocular compensation during active vs. passive head movements, and (3) during combined active and passive head movements, eye movements compensated for both the active and passive component of head velocity. These results support our hypothesis that while the VOR provides compensation during passive head movements, PPEM are used by both intact and lesioned subjects during active movements and further, that PPEM work together with the VOR to achieve gaze stability.

AB  - The aim of this study was to report our experience of using the free RASPBF to treat a range of finger i nj uries. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent RASPBF transfer reconstruction for finger injuries between October 2010 and March 2015. The mean age of the patients was 42years Irange 1 6-651; there were 95 men and 30 women. The injured digits were: thumb 40, index finger 38, middte finger 28, ring finger 16 and tittte finger nine. The patients were divided into three groups: 46 distat finger injuries , 25 amputations fottowing faited finger reptanta-tions and 54 patmar injuries with tendon, bone or joint exposed. 0ut of 125 cases, 109 had face-to-face fottow-up consuttation, 11 of them had tetephone consuttation and five of them had chart review as we coutd not contact them. At finat fottow-up at a mean of 32 months Irange 60-121,120 patients were assessed. During the fottow-up consuttation, we performed the fottowing assessments. To eva[uate function, we measured totaI active motion ITAMl. TAM was defined as the ratio of the totaI arc of motion in the affected digits compared with the contrataterat digits, and was recorded for the distaI interphatangeat, proximaI interphatangeat and metacarpophatangeat joints IUsami et at., 20151. For the thumb ctose to the donor site, the TAM test was conducted after l2weeks of surgery; white for the digits with ftaps, the TAM test was conducted at the finaI foltow-up. We used static two-point discrimination with the two-point discrimi-nator IFabrication Enterprises, lnc., Etmsford, NY, USAI to assess sensibitity in the ftap. To assess cotd intoterance, we asked patients about skin cotour changes and any uncomfortabte symptoms Ipain, numbness, aching, stiffness) depending on the temperature conditions of the environment [Sun et at., 20161. To assess the donor-site, we asked about pain using a visuatanatogue scate, and asked about numbness or paraesthesia ltingtingl. We assessed donor site hypertrophic scarring by subjectivety assessing thickness, width and pigmentation. 0perative technique Fottowing wound debridement [Figure 1[a)) the artery and vein of the donor side were dissected and marked with a single stitch IFigure 1[b)]. The skin overtying the scaphoid tubercte was inctuded in the ftap so that a flap of the desired size could be constructed and the major axis of the ftap coutd be directed toward the three digits. Additionatty, mid-patmar creases were ptaced atong the utnar side of the ftap to minimize the surgicaI scar IFigure 1[c]]. First, the proximaI part of the ftap was incised and the superficiaI patmar vein under the skin was dissected and marked. Second, the ftap was incised from proximatty to radiatty to dissect out the superficiaI patmar branch of the radiaI artery and venae commitantes. Then, the ftap was incised from the radiaI side of the ftap up to the distaI end, white the distaI part of the superficial palmar branch of the radiatartery entering the thenar muscte were [ocated and [igated. Lastty, the remaining proxi-maI utnar side was incised and the patmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve that pierces the fascia from the proximaI part of the ftap was incised. ln order to try to avoid a superficial neuroma, the most proxi-maI part of nerve was divided proximatty. The ftap was positioned over the recipient site, the artery of the ftap was connected to the digital artery and the venae commitantes were connected with a patmar digitat vein (Figure l[d] and [e]. lf the venae commitantes were too smat[ to be connected, the superficiaI patmar vein of the ftap was anastomosed to the digital vein on the dorsal side of the finger. Neurorrhaphy was performed between the median patmar cutaneous branch and the digitat nerve. After neurorrhaphy, the donor site was ctosed. The patients remained in hospitaI on comptete bed rest for 5 days. They underwent rehabititation for digit movement starting 2weeks post-operativety. The patient was attowed to return to normaI activities at /rweeks post-operativety. Between 3 and 6months post-operatively, a debutking procedure was performed as required IFigure 1[f)1.

TI  - The Kenny Method of Treatment for Infantile Paralysis
PY  - 1942
AB  - Since June 1940, The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has sponsored a study of the Kenny Method of treatment at the University of Minnesota Medical School under the direction of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Physical Therapy. The authors do not intend this manual to replace Miss Kenny's book on treatment. It does not attempt to analyse or to modify the theory of the treatment, but is an attempt in the light of experience, to clarify what she has written about the technique. Miss Kenny's terminology has been retained; it describes the facts although it is riot scientifically accurate. In 1941, after the first term of observation, it was concluded that the Kenny Method would be the basis for the future treatment of infantile paralysis. Further study and observation have confirmed the conclusion. The authors believe that more general use of the method is advisable. According to Miss Kenny the patient with infantile paralysis shows three major symptoms. Muscle spasm, " incoordination, " and "mental alienation." When the infection is severe, enough anterior horn cells are destroyed at the outset to cause complete flaccid paralysis of certain muscles or parts and spasm, if present, may be fleeting. Treatment in such cases will not be effective in preventing paralysis. Muscle spasm denotes a group of symptoms which include fibrillary twitchings, hyper-irritability to stretching and a tonic contraction of fibres which frequently cannot be overcome, even by great force. If spasm is not relieved it will result in destruction of muscle tissue with permanent changes and deformities. Spasm will cause further disruption of the motor system by eliminating or " alienating " non-affected muscles and will produce " incoordination " of the muscles concerned in the joint motions of the region involved. Examination of a patient with untreated spasm will show that the patient suffers from stiffness and contractions rather than from paralysis and weakness. The attempt to keep a hyperirritable muscle under tension in a cast or splint induces a stretch reflex which further increases the spasm and adds to the damage in the muscle. Spasm may be diagnosed by observation, or by observation and palpation. It becomes obvious when the affected muscle is stretched. If possible the diagnosis should be made by observation. The authors review the muscular system in some detail and give the characteristics of spasm in the various muscle groups. Special attention is directed to spasm of the respiratory muscles. " Incoordination " is described as of two kinds: (a) That which is due to spread of motor impulses, intended for a certain muscle, to a group of muscles, and which may arise from pain on attempt to move the involved muscle or from inability 'of that muscle to perform its proper function; (b) That occurring within the involved muscle itself so that ineffective contraction is produced, instead of a coordinated rhythmic contraction producing maximum motion at the insertion of the muscle. When uncontrolled' voluntary motion is attempted in the presence of spasm it leads to " incoordina-tion " by the development of abnormal motion patterns and misuse of muscles. Active movements should therefore be carefully supervised and directed or they may lead to difficulties in securing the return of normal function. " Mental alienation " describes an inability to produce a voluntary purposeful movement in a muscle, although the nerve paths to that muscle are intact. This is a physiological block which must be distinguished from the organic interruption resulting from destruction of anterior horn cells. Muscles which do not function because of " mental alienation " may remain permanently in this state unless they are treated. The Kenny treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis of infantile paralysis is made. As soon as spasm appears, hot fomentations are applied to the affected muscles until it is relieved. They may be applied as often as every 15 minutes when spasm is unusually severe or threatens the life of the patient. Passive motion, through the range that can be obtained without pain, is carried out at least once a day. Splints are not used in the early treatment. The author states that the Kenny technique does not permit muscle testing or the use of respirators. The respirator is not used because its mechanical action aggravates spasm in the intercostal muscles. Patients in whom the higher centres are involved are not benefited by foments and their condition may be aggravated by the respirator. The purpose of the Kenny method of muscle re-education is to restore connexion of the part with the central nervous system (to restore " mental awareness " of the muscle and its connexions). The method demands an intimate knowledge of muscle anatomy and much attention to detail. The treatment must be checked and supervised by the physician in charge of the case. The re-education of muscles can be done only by technicians with the highest skill and ability. Muscle strength is not a primary consideration; the aim is a re-establishment of awareness and the production of a normal rhythmic motion no matter how weak. Increase in muscle strength will follow. The authors describe the technique of muscle re-education and give a fairly complete description of the re-education of the muscles of the neck, the shoulder girdle, the upper extremity, the trunk, and the lower extremity. [The Kenny method has not been so favourably reported on in Britain and Miss Kenny's notions on the pathological physiology of poliomyelitis have not been generally accepted here. There should not be a divergence of opinion about the symptomatic treatment of this serious disease. It seems clear that further studies must be made on the neuromuscular mechanisms and on the muscle changes in the acute stage so that the causes of spasm are unfolded. The effect of contrast therapy on the nerves, muscles", and circulation should also be studied and an effort should be made to place the treatment on a basis which will meet universal agreement. For an Australian report on the Kenny method, see this Bulletin, 1938, v. 13, 627.] J. C.McEntee.

TI  - The Kessel prosthesis in total shoulder arthroplasty: A five-year experience
PY  - 1992
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985, 23 Kessel total shoulder arthroplasties were performed on 22 patients. A clinical and roentgenographic review was performed by an independent observer. Three patients had their prostheses removed and three had revision surgery, leaving 17 shoulders in 16 patients available for study, all with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All patients were relieved of pain and noticed a general improvement in activities of daily living. Passive flexion and rotation were increased, but active movements remained unchanged. Roentgenographically, radiolucent zones developed around the scapular component on all patients within one year but only around one of the humeral components. Total shoulder arthroplasties with the Kessel prosthesis in RA relieved pain and improved shoulder and arm function. The long-term results were complicated by a high incidence of loosening of the glenoid component, probably a feature of the constrained design of the Kessel prosthesis.

TI  - The Kinematic Analysis of Korean Athlete of Men’s Shot put - In 2011 IAAF World Championship Daegu -
PY  - 2012
AB  - This research aims to kinematically analyze the movements of Korean male shot-putters who participated in IAAF World Championships Daegu 2011. To accomplish this puropse, this research analyzed seven factors executive time of delivery phase, center of mass (COM) displacement, center of mass (COM) velocity, release angle, release height, release velocity and shot trajectories of ball.This research drew the following conclusions.First, for executive time of delivery phase, P2 (Phase 2) was long. So, horizontal rapid acceleration should be obtained by shortening the executive time of glide phase. This will exercise a positive influence on a throwing distance.Second, vertical displacement of center of mass is the process of momentum transfer from proximal muscle to distal muscle in shot-putting. During the process, in E3 (Event 3) energetic knee extension is done to transfer effective and explosive powers. A shot-putter should do the following sequential movements by using elasticity of waist twisting: moving the upper body forward and stretching one arm.Third, COM velocity according to executive time of delivery phsae falls in the landing moment of back fee t (i.e. E3 (Event 3)) and the release moment (i.e. E5 (Event 5) )A. shot-putter needs an active play in that th e passive play of the shot-putter who considers the foul of release moment acts as a factor of reducing COM velocity and that the reduction of speed interrupts momentum transfer.Fourth, contrary to world-class/international shot-putters, Korean players showed greater differences of release velocity compared to release angle and release heightT. o overcome this, they should increase COM velocity in E3 and E5 more. Active and dynamic movements are prerequisite for an increase in the speed.Finally, shot trajectories of ball showing its movements and rlease direction tend to fly to the right when a shot-putter releases the ball. The tendency is caused by the wrong rotation of the body, that is, the improper momentum transfer in the skill types for glide of release methdos of straight line. This results in a loss o f throwing distance. To make up for the weak point, a shot-putter should correct his body rotation. This can be expected to contribute to a rise in release velocity acting as an important factor of throwing distance.

TI  - The MOC Reflex During Active Listening to Speech
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that active listening to speech would increase medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent activity for the right vs. the left ear.Method: Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) were evoked by 60-dB p. e. SPL clicks in 13 normally hearing adults in 4 test conditions for each ear: (a) in quiet; (b) with 60-dB SPL contralateral broadband noise; (c) with words embedded (at -3-dB signal-to-noise ratio [SNR]) in 60-dB SPL contralateral noise during which listeners directed attention to the words; and (d) for the same SNR as in the 3rd condition, with words played backwards.Results: There was greater suppression during active listening compared with passive listening that was apparent in the latency range of 6- to 18-ms poststimulus onset. Ear differences in CEOAE amplitude were observed in all conditions, with right-ear amplitudes larger than those for the left. The absolute difference between CEOAE amplitude in quiet and with contralateral noise, a metric of suppression, was equivalent for right and left ears. When the amplitude differences were normalized, suppression was greater for noise presented to the right and the effect measured for a probe in the left ear.Conclusion: The findings support the theory that cortical mechanisms involved in listening to speech affect cochlear function through the MOC efferent system.

TI  - The MPI cybermotion simulator: A novel research platform to investigate human control behavior
PY  - 2013
AB  - The MPI CyberMotion Simulator provides a unique motion platform, as it features an anthropomorphic robot with a large workspace, combined with an actuated cabin and a linear track for lateral movement. This paper introduces the simulator as a tool for studying human perception, and compares its characteristics to conventional Stewart platforms. Furthermore, an experimental evaluation is presented in which multimodal human control behavior is studied by identifying the visual and vestibular responses of participants in a roll-lateral helicopter hover task. The results show that the simulator motion allows participants to increase tracking performance by changing their control strategy, shifting from reliance on visual error perception to reliance on simulator motion cues. The MPI CyberMotion Simulator has proven to be a state-of-the-art motion simulator for psychophysical research to study humans with various experimental paradigms, ranging from passive perception experiments to active control tasks, such as driving a car or flying a helicopter. © 2013.

TI  - The Malnutrition-Related Increase in Early Visceralization of Leishmania donovani Is Associated with a Reduced Number of Lymph Node Phagocytes and Altered Conduit System Flow
PY  - 2013
AB  - In a murine model of moderate childhood malnutrition we found that polynutrient deficiency led to a 4-5-fold increase in early visceralization of L. donovani (3 days post-infection) following cutaneous infection and a 16-fold decrease in lymph node barrier function (p<0.04 for all). To begin to understand the mechanistic basis for this malnutrition-related parasite dissemination we analyzed the cellularity, architecture, and function of the skin-draining lymph node. There was no difference in the localization of multiple cell populations in the lymph node of polynutrient deficient (PND) mice, but there was reduced cellularity with fewer CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs), fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), MOMA-2(+) macrophages, and CD169(+) subcapsular sinus macrophage (p<0.05 for all) compared to the well-nourished (WN) mice. The parasites were equally co-localized with DCs associated with the lymph node conduit network in the WN and PND mice, and were found in the high endothelial venule into which the conduits drain. When a fluorescent low molecular weight (10 kD) dextran was delivered in the skin, there was greater efflux of the marker from the lymph node conduit system to the spleens of PND mice (p<0.04), indicating that flow through the conduit system was altered. There was no evidence of disruption of the conduit or subcapsular sinus architecture, indicating that the movement of parasites into the subcortical conduit region was due to an active process and not from passive movement through a leaking barrier. These results indicate that the impaired capacity of the lymph node to act as a barrier to dissemination of L. donovani infection is associated with a reduced number of lymph node phagocytes, which most likely leads to reduced capture of parasites as they transit through the sinuses and conduit system.

TI  - The Manchester short splint: A change to splinting practice in the rehabilitation of zone II flexor tendon repairs
PY  - 2014
AB  - Introduction: The results of patients with primary zone II flexor tendon repairs rehabilitated using a traditional forearm-based splint were audited and compared with those who were managed in the Manchester short splint. Method: The short splint was fabricated to permit maximal wrist flexion and up to 45° of wrist extension with a block to 30° of metacarpophalangeal joint extension. A rehabilitation regimen consisting of early combined passive flexion exercises and active motion was employed. In 2011, 62 patients (76 digits) with a mean age of 34 years (range 14–58) were rehabilitated using the forearm-based splint (group A). In 2012, 40 patients (45 digits) with a mean age of 31 years (range 15–71) were rehabilitated using the Manchester short splint (group B). Results: Group B had significantly less flexion contracture at their proximal interphalangeal joints than group A at 6 weeks (median 15° versus 28°; p=0.003) and 12 weeks (median 6° versus 18°; p=0.024) postoperatively. At the final review, group B had a significantly greater arc of flexion at their distal interphalangeal joints (median 59° versus 30°; p<0.001) and a greater proportion of patients with excellent/good Strickland’s grades. There were three (3.9%) ruptures in group A and two (4.4%) ruptures in group B (p>0.999). Conclusion: The use of a shorter splint would appear to enhance the outcomes whilst preserving repair integrity. © The British Association of Hand Therapists Ltd 2014.

TI  - The Medawar Lecture 2001 - Knowledge for vision: vision for knowledge
PY  - 2005
AB  - An evolutionary development of perception is suggested-from passive reception to active perception to explicit conception-earlier stages being largely retained and incorporated in later species. A key is innate and then individually learned knowledge, giving meaning to sensory signals. Inappropriate or misapplied knowledge produces rich cognitive phenomena of illusions, revealing normally hidden processes of vision, tentatively classified here in a 'peeriodic table'. Phenomena of physiology are distinguished from phenomena of general rules and specific object knowledge. It is concluded that vision uses implicit knowledge, and provides knowledge for intelligent behaviour and for explicit conceptual understanding including science.

TI  - The More It Changes, the More It becomes the Same: The Development of the Routine of Shape Identification in Dynamic Geometry Environment
PY  - 2012
AB  - The overall aim of our research project is to explore the impact of dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) on children's geometrical thinking. The point of departure for the study presented in this paper is the analytically and empirically grounded assumption that as the geometric discourse develops, the direct visual identification of geometric shapes gives way to discursively mediated identification, that is to a process in which one needs to perform a discursive procedure, prescribed by a formal definition of the shape, in order to ascertain the name of the shape. Previous research, conducted in static geometry environments, has already shown that many children, even in the middle school grades, rely on static, visual prototypes when identifying geometric shapes and that formal definitions, even if known, play no role in this process. Our study aimed at testing the conjecture that DGEs, in which the shapes can be continuously transformed, may flex the routine of identification, allowing for greater diversity in the shapes recognized as deserving a given name (e.g. triangle). This, we believed, would be an important step toward the discursively mediated routine of identification. The study, conducted among 4-5 year-old children working with "Sketchpad", furnished some supporting evidence. In this paper, the focus is on one 30-min lesson during which the children observed, described, created and transformed triangles of different sizes, proportions, and orientations. During this one meeting the children's thinking evolved, in that the diversity of three-sided polygons they were prepared to call "triangle" grew substantially. Not surprisingly, however, this rapidly-induced change was local and object-level rather than meta-level: it changed the children's use of a specific word rather than causing a transition to a discourse-mediated routine of identification.

TI  - The Most Beautiful Pearls: Speculative Thoughts on a Phenomenology of Attention (with Husserl and Goethe)
PY  - 2017
AB  - In this chapter, I present some systematic thoughts on a phenomenology of attention, There are two angles from which I will approach this topic. For one, the phenomenon in question is quite important for Husserl, but his thoughts on the topic have not been known to the public until recently through a new volume of the Hussediana (Hua XXXVIII) that presents the only analyses in HusserIs entire oeuvre dealing with this phenomenon. As it turns out, attention, as located between passive perception and active, synthetic consciousness, plays a key role in genetic phenomenology and its attempt to work out the levels of consciousness from passivity to activity. Hence, one part of this paper has the intention of presenting some of Husserrs thoughts on attention and the systematic role it plays in his phenomenology of constituting consciousness. Secondly, in order to further the systematic point of the phenomenon, I turn to Goethe's reflections on the primal phenomenon (Urpheinomen) that can, I believe, be brought to bear on attention, Indeed, the primal phenomenon as a phenomenon that immediately and forcefully seizes our attention Goethe, once compares to "the most beautiful pearls" in a chain of related phenomena. Among the phenomena appearing to us, some "simply" have a special quality in that they beckon us to investigate them, very much in the way in which Husserl describes the manner in which some phenomena lure us to focus our attention on them, Finally, if it is the world which "chooses," as it were, certain phenomena for us to be drawn into their meaningful contexts, this observation has serious consequences for phenomenology as transcendental idealism. I want to put it as a question: What does it mean for a theory of world-constitution through consciousness that the world is "designed" such that certain phenomena are privileged from within the world to leap out at us, enticing us to explore it? Does attention bring us before the limits of phenomenology as transcendental idealism?

TI  - The Moving Rubber Hand Illusion Reveals that Explicit Sense of Agency for Tapping Movements Is Preserved in Functional Movement Disorders
PY  - 2017
AB  - Functional movement disorders (FMD) are characterized by motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, gait disorder, and dystonia) that are not compatible with movement abnormalities related to a known organic cause. One key clinical feature of FMD is that motor symptoms are similar to voluntary movements but are subjectively experienced as involuntary by patients. This gap might be related to abnormal self-recognition of bodily action, which involves two main components: sense of agency and sense of body ownership. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate whether this function is altered in FMD, specifically focusing on the subjective feeling of agency, body ownership, and their interaction during normal voluntary movements. Patients with FMD (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 21) underwent the moving Rubber Hand Illusion (mRHI), in which passive and active movements can differentially elicit agency, ownership or both. Explicit measures of agency and ownership were obtained via a questionnaire. Patients and controls showed a similar pattern of response: when the rubber hand was in a plausible posture, active movements elicited strong agency and ownership; implausible posture of the rubber hand abolished ownership but not agency; passive movements suppressed agency but not ownership. These findings suggest that explicit sense of agency and body ownership are preserved in FMD. The latter finding is shared by a previous study in FMD using a static version of the RHI, whereas the former appears to contrast with studies demonstrating altered implicit measures of agency (e.g., sensory attenuation). Our study extends previous findings by suggesting that in FMD: (i) the sense of body ownership is retained also when interacting with the motor system; (ii) the subjective experience of agency for voluntary tapping movements, as measured by means of mRHI, is preserved.

TI  - The Mulligan Concept; The Next Step in the Evolution of Manual Therapy MCTA Accredited Mulligan Concept Teacher
PY  - 1999
AB  - Brian Mulligan's novel concept of the simultaneous application of therapist applied accessory mobilizations and patient generated active movements is described. The indications for use of this unique approach and examples of commonly treated clinical presentations are outlined. Increased function and decreased pain are expected to be immediate and sustained with the application of these techniques with no pain experienced during their utilization. Introduction The Physiotherapy treatment of musckuloskeletal injuries has progressed from its foundation in remedial gymnastics and active exercise to therapist-applied passive physiological movement and on to therapist-applied accessory techniques. Brian Mulligan's concept of mobilizations with movement (MWMS) is the logical continuance of this evolution with the concurrent application of both therapist applied accessory and patient generated active physiological movements. These techniques were developed by Mulligan in New Zealand through his role as the principle clinical instructor for the New Zealand Manipulative Therapy Associations Graduate Diploma program and over 30 years in private clinical practice. First used in the cervical spine, MWMs quickly found their way into the treatment of peripheral joint dysfunctions and have undergone clinical refinement and expansion to all areas of the spine and most extremity joints.

TI  - The Nature of the Sensory Input to the Neonatal Rat Barrel Cortex
PY  - 2016
AB  - Sensory input plays critical roles in the development of the somatosensory cortex during the neonatal period. This early sensory input may involve: (1) stimulation arising from passive interactions with the mother and littermates and (2) sensory feedback arising from spontaneous infant movements. The relative contributions of these mechanisms under natural conditions remain largely unknown, however. Here, we show that, in the whisker-related barrel cortex of neonatal rats, spontaneous whisker movements and passive stimulation by the littermates cooperate, with comparable efficiency, in driving cortical activity. Both tactile signals arising from the littermate's movements under conditions simulating the littermates' position in the litter, and spontaneous whisker movements efficiently triggered bursts of activity in barrel cortex. Yet, whisker movements with touch were more efficient than free movements. Comparison of the various experimental conditions mimicking the natural environment showed that tactile signals arising from the whisker movements with touch and stimulation by the littermates, support: (1) a twofold higher level of cortical activity than in the isolated animal, and (2) a threefold higher level of activity than in the deafferented animal after the infraorbital nerve cut. Together, these results indicate that endogenous (self-generated movements) and exogenous (stimulation by the littermates) mechanisms cooperate in driving cortical activity in newborn rats and point to the importance of the environment in shaping cortical activity during the neonatal period.

PY  - 2013
AB  - The original objective of this study was to quantify spasticity in a spastic subject using the Pendulum Knee Drop test. An interesting phenomenon was observed while analyzing the collected data. The neural contribution in defining or changing the set point for a passive joint movement is not well understood, therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explain the noted phenomenon according to the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis with which we can justify the changes in moments during PKD test. In passive limb movements the virtual trajectory follows the actual trajectory; in contrast for an active movement the desired trajectory precedes the actual trajectory. The present data explains passive knee movement during PKD for a CP individual and describe the changes in joint moment as function of theta(vt) assigned by the CNS.

TI  - The NuMesh: A modular, scalable communications substrate
PY  - 1993
AB  - Many standardized hardware communication interfaces offer runtime flexibility and configurability at the cost of efficiency. An alternate approach is the use of a highly-efficient, minimal communication element, with as much communication decision-making as possible done at compile time. NuMesh is a packaging and interconnect technology supporting high-bandwidth systolic communications on a 3D nearest-neighbor lattice; our goal is to combine Lego-like modularity with supercomputer performance. To date, the primary focus of the project has been the class of applications whose static communication patterns can be precompiled into independent and carefully choreographed finite state machines running on each node. Several extensions of the NuMesh to more general communication paradigms have been implemented, and the issues involved are under active exploration. This paper presents an overview of our approach, as well as an introduction to our current-generation prototype. We also discuss our software environment and simulation technology, and enumerate some of the applications and programming models we have developed to make full use of the capabilities of the NuMesh. © 1993 ACM.

TI  - The Onset Time of the Ownership Sensation in the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion
PY  - 2017
AB  - The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a perceptual illusion whereby a model hand is perceived as part of one's own body. This illusion has been extensively studied, but little is known about the temporal evolution of this perceptual phenomenon, i.e., how long it takes until participants start to experience ownership over the model hand. In the present study, we investigated a version of the rubber hand experiment based on finger movements and measured the average onset time in active and passive movement conditions. This comparison enabled us to further explore the possible role of intentions and motor control processes that are only present in the active movement condition. The results from a large group of healthy participants (n = 117) showed that the illusion of ownership took approximately 23 s to emerge (active: 22.8; passive: 23.2). The 90th percentile occurs in both conditions within approximately 50 s (active: 50; passive: 50.6); therefore, most participants experience the illusion within the first minute. We found indirect evidence of a facilitatory effect of active movements compared to passive movements, and we discuss these results in the context of our current understanding of the processes underlying the moving RHI.

TI  - The Oss of Dynamic Motion about ‘Qian’
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper aims to demonstrate the semantic, functional change of Qian and figure out the cause which affects the loss of dynamic motion among Qian. In this paper, we investigate a large sum of diachronic and synchronic Chinese texts based on Chinese corpus. Evidences are given to show that Archaic Chinese Qian has been a motion verb involved ＜motion＞ and ＜path＞ in the motion event which was proposed by Talmy,L.(2000a, 200b). However Qian has lost its function of motion gradually and only the function of static location survived in Mandarin Chinese. In order to account for the historical change of Qian, this paper gives a brief review of the distribution and usage about Qian in different Chinese historical stages and classifies the sentences in which Qian occurs into four types: ‘Bare Verb-Qian’, ‘Qian+Common Verb’, ‘Qian+Motion Verb’ and ‘Qian+Common Noun’. In conclusion, we figure out that there are several factors which may result in the loss of the motion about Qian. First, asymmetry between Archaic Qian and Hou. Second, reanalysis of the ‘Qian+Verb’ structure. Third, the change of Chinese conceptualization pattern etc. The emergence and development of 處置式(e.g. BA construction) and 使成式(e.g. SHI construction) in Ancient Chinese has also be a part which may affects the loss of the motion about Qian.

The author updates the problem of supporting the students’ attention during the lecture, since modern electronic devises have increased their «stickiness», attractiveness and accessibility and have become the main teachers’ “competitor” in obtaining students’ attention. Numerous statements regarding the term «attention» and types of attention are given by leading domestic and foreign psychologists” in its essential characteristics. The author indicates that today’s modern students’ society understanding has been more formed in the virtual world than in real one, this kind of understanding communicates with social networks in non-stop mode and within the study time, during the lectures, seminars, between the work of mastering professional training program. The demonstration of an abstract, passive listening by students of a lecturer in the course of lessons, poor subject mastering causes fears among teachers, who are powerless in the face of the pressure of the gadget revolution and technological modernization. The author focuses on the various components of the lecture, makes recommendations for the increase of students’ active attention.

TI  - The Ramp Archetype: A Score-Based Study of Musical Dynamics in 14 Piano Composers
PY  - 1991
AB  - A study of 435 piano works by 14 composers reveals a significant asymmetry between increasing and decreasing dynamics. Specificallv: (1) there is an association between incremental crescendos and abrupt diminuendos for successions of static dynamic indications, (2) crescendos are more frequent than diminuendos, (3) crescendos tend to last longer than diminuendos, (4) crescendos will more commonly follow low dynamic levels than will diminuen- dos follow high dynamic levels, and (5) sudden changes in dynamics are much more prone to be reductions of loudness than increases of loudness. These findings support the existence of a “ramp archetype” for musical dynamics in which the music tends to build in a gradual way, but tends to subside relatively quickly. The results replicate and extend a previous study of musical dynamics in Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. The results are consistent with a well-adapted strategy for maintaining passive auditory attention/arousal. © 1991, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

LogMAR scores on static visual acuity test demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability among healthy young adults while DVA loss symmetry and number of incorrect responses on the DVA and gaze stabilization test demonstrated good-to-moderate test-retest reliability. The lack of concurrent validity between GST and DVA tests suggests that these tests measure different constructs of dynamic visual acuity.

TI  - The Reported Incidence of Man-Machine Interface Issues in Army Aviators Using the Aviator's Night Vision System (ANVIS) in a Combat Theatre
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Army Aviators rely on the ANVIS for night operations. Human factors literature notes that the ANVIS man-machine interface results in reports of visual and spinal complaints. This is the first study that has looked at these issues in the much harsher combat environment. Last year, the authors reported on the statistically significant (p<0.01) increased complaints of visual discomfort, degraded visual cues, and incidence of static and dynamic visual illusions in the combat environment [Proc. SPIE, Vol. 7688, 76880G (2010)]. In this paper we present the findings regarding increased spinal complaints and other man-machine interface issues found in the combat environment. Methods: A survey was administered to Aircrew deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Results: 82 Aircrew (representing an aggregate of >89,000 flight hours of which >22,000 were with ANVIS) participated. Analysis demonstrated high complaints of almost all levels of back and neck pain. Additionally, the use of body armor and other Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) caused significant ergonomic complaints when used with ANVIS. Conclusions: ANVIS use in a combat environment resulted in higher and different types of reports of spinal symptoms and other man-machine interface issues over what was previously reported. Data from this study may be more operationally relevant than that of the peacetime literature as it is derived from actual combat and not from training flights, and it may have important implications about making combat predictions based on performance in training scenarios. Notably, Aircrew remarked that they could not execute the mission without ANVIS and ALSE and accepted the degraded ergonomic environment.

TI  - The Representation of Space Through Static and Dynamic Tactile Displays
PY  - 2004
AB  - Tactile displays to enhance appreciation of virtual and real environments are becoming increasingly common (e.g., Dobbins & Samway, 2002; Rupert, 2000; van Erp, 2000). Often, however, the optimal display design for the human operator has not been well-explored. Extending a series of prior studies, the following experiments explored parameters that influence spatial resolution for individual vibrating sites on very dense arrays worn on the observer’s trunk. Two tactor types, two stimulus frequencies, and three locations across the abdomen were tested in the series. Stimuli were composed of individual vibrating locations (stationary stimuli) or a series of vibrating sites that create the impression of movement across the skin (dynamic stimuli). In all cases, the task for the observer involved identifying the location of the vibrotactile stimulus on the body. Significant variables included the location of the target tactor within the array and the location of the array on the body. Tactor type and stimulus frequency did not affect performance. Performance was improved for sites at the body midline or corners of the arrays, while errors tended to be made in a direction away from the body midline. It was also possible to improve performance by “frequency-tagging” sites within the array, providing artificial anchors that the operator could use as points of reference

TI  - The Research of Depth Perception Method Based on Sparse Random Grid
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this paper, we propose a high-resolution depth sensing method based on structured light. In 3D contour scanning, passive binocular stereo vision is difficult to obtain enough 3D information for objects with inconspicuous surface features. To solve this problem, based on the binocular stereo vision principle and the structured light projection method in active vision, a method of obtaining sparse depth based on random mesh is proposed. Four templates are projected onto the surface of the object, which are random meshes and three templates with phase difference. In addition, the relative phase image is calculated according to the three-step phase-shifting mode. Finally, the depth map calculated in the conventional structured light method. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness algorithm to show that our depth sensing are more accurate and resolution than the existing methods in the experiments.

TI  - The Role of Fabricated Chimeric Free Flaps in Reconstruction of Devastating Hand and Forearm Injuries
PY  - 2011
AB  - Devastating hand and forearm injuries almost exclusively need free flap transfer if reconstruction is attempted. Early active and passive motion is only possible with aggressive, early, and comprehensive reconstruction. Despite recent advances in compound flaps, in selected cases it might be wise to harvest several smaller flaps and microsurgically combine them to one "chain-linked" flap "system." Four microsurgically fabricated chimeric free flaps were used in four patients for complex hand and forearm injuries. The combinations were sensate anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap plus sensate extended lateral arm flap (2x), ALT plus free fibula, and ALT plus functional musculocutaneous gracilis muscle. All flaps survived completely. Functional rehabilitation was possible immediately after flap transfer. There were no donor-site complications except two widened scars. The microsurgical fabrication of chimeric free flaps, as well established in head and neck reconstruction, can be successfully adapted to massive hand injuries as well. Individual placement of selected tissue components, early comprehensive reconstruction, and reduction of the number of operations are beneficial in cases that need more than one free flap.

TI  - The Role of Neuronal Oscillations in Visual Active Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Visual perception is most often studied as a "passive" process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural "active" vision, however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. The underlying motor sampling plan contains highly reliable information regarding "where" and "when" the eyes will land, this information can be used predictively to modify firing properties of neurons precisely at the time when this "contextual" information is most useful - when a volley of retinal input enters the system at the onset of each fixation. Analyses focusing on neural events leading to and resulting from shifts in fixation, as well as visual events external to the observer, can provide a more complete and mechanistic understanding of visual information processing. Studies thus far suggest that active vision may be a fundamentally different from that process we usually study with more traditional passive viewing paradigms. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain's visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.

TI  - The Role of Trust in Health Decision Making Among African American Men Recruited From Urban Barbershops
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective: To examine factors within the patient-provider relationship that influence which role African American men aged 40-70 years prefer when making health care decisions.Methods: We recruited 40 African American men from barbershops in the Richmond, Virginia, metropolitan area to participate in semistructured interviews. At the completion of each interview, participants completed a brief self-administered demographic survey.The semistructured interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim and then imported into a qualitative software program for organizing, sorting, and coding data. The principles of thematic analysis and template approach were used in this study. The survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results: Trust was a major theme that emerged from the semistructured interviews. The men listed trust in the health care provider as the primary reason for choosing a collaborative or active role in the decision-making process. Within the theme of trust, 4 subthemes emerged: expertise, information sharing, active listening, and relationship length. Thirty-five out of the 40 men interviewed preferred an active or collaborative role in the decision-making process; only 5 preferred passive decision making.Conclusions: Trust emerged as an important factor that influenced role preference for African American men when making health care decisions in the context of the patient-provider relationship. Future studies that help identify which other factors influence health care decision-making roles among African American men may have implications for addressing health disparities among this population and improve the quality of their health care.

TI  - The Role of the Epidermal Cells in the Stomatal Movements
PY  - 1966
AB  - The water deficit of the leaves, the osmotic values of the stomatal cells and epidermal cells at incipiment plasmolysis, as well as the width of the stomatal apparatus and pore opening, were measured every hour from 6‐17 o'clock under natural environmental conditions. During the noon hours, the intensity of light in clear weather ranged from 40,000‐55,000 lux in the open position, and from 15,000‐20,000 lux in the shade. The temperature was usually 15–20°C. The experimental object was Vicia Faba growing in a field, both plants freely rooted and plants in pots buried in the soil. The experiments resulted in the following observations and conclusions: 1. When leaves are exposed to strong light, the osmotic value at incipient plasmolysis changes not only in the guard cells, but also in the epidermal cells. If the epidermal cells' osmotic value rises, water is sucked from the guard cells and their uptake of water by suction is decreased, which promotes closure and counteracts opening, respectively. If the value falls, the effect is the reverse. The guard cells react passively to these epidermal changes. The passive stomatal movement eliciteed in this way has therefore been denoted as “osmopassive”, in contrast to the long known passive movement caused by a change in turgor of the epidermal cells, and which has therefore been denoted as “turgorpasslve”. The osmopassive component of stomatal closure has an earlier and more rapid onset than the hydroactive closing reaction, which consists of a decrease in the guard cells' osmotic value. Stomatat closure often starts with the osmopassive rapid process, and is completed and stabilized by the hydroactive process. It has not been possible to determine whether the osmopassive closing reaction is identical with the rapid reaction previously described, and interpreted as of adenoid nature, and tlius belonging to the active group. 2. The osmotic potential of the guard cells ‐ i.e., the difference between the osmotic value of guard cells and epidermal cells at incipient plasmolysis ‐ is, therefore, formed not only by a cbange in the osmotic value of the former cells, but also by a cbange in that of the latter. 3. Although the pore width runs largely parallel to the osmotic value of the guard cells, there is greater agreement between pore width and osmotic potential. When the water deficit of the leaf exceeds a certain threshold value, potential and stomatal width start to decrease. Closure is completed when the fall in potential approaches the zero value. If the water deficit subsequently continues to increase, the potential becomes negative and the stomata remain closed. 4. The stomatal movements are regulated by physiological processes which form two kinds of equilibrium between increase and decrease of the osmotic potential of the guard cells, i.e. the osmopassive increase ‐ osmopassive decrease and the photoactive increase ‐ hydroactive decrease. These equilibria complement each other in rate and stability. The osmopassive processes start rapidly and as soon as the deficit cbanges; hydroactive closure and sometimes also photoactive opening, are, on the contrary, time‐consuming. When the water deficit is suboptimal, turgorpassive opening and closing are superadded, but only in those cases in which the osmotic potential of the guard cetls is positive.

TI  - The Rorschach active-passive movement response: A concurrent validation study.
PY  - 2005
AB  - The present investigation explored whether inflexibly active, balanced, and inflexibly passive individuals display the interpersonal characteristics and ideational flexibility described in the Comprehensive System (Exner, 1974, 1986, 1993, 2003), in an attempt to validate the a:p ratio. The sample included 101 non-patient adults who completed the Rorschach and were videotaped discussing a problem area in their relationship with their spouse for a period of 10-minutes. The videotapes were coded for the presence of affects and behaviors representing Exner's (1974, 1986, 1993, 2003) description of inflexibly active, balanced, and inflexibly passive individuals. These affects and behaviors were used to determine if there were relationships between the a:p ratio and (a) the Specific Affect Coding System's (SPAFF; Gottman, 1996) affects of domineering, interest, and validation, (b) type of response to proposed solutions, (c) dominance as measured by the visual dominance ratio (Exline, Ellyson, & Long, 1974), and number of successful interruptions, and (d) locus of control as measured by number of solutions proposed, immediately accepting proposed solutions, and length of time speaking. Linear and logistic regression analyses yielded few significant findings. However, several findings are noteworthy. First, number of solutions proposed, immediately accepting proposed solutions, and length of time speaking (external locus of control) were found to predict inflexibly passive individuals (p < 0.05) jointly. Number of proposed solutions and immediately accepting proposed solutions were found to be significant predictors of inflexibly passive individuals. Second, although validation was found to predict the a:p ratio (p < .01), an examination of the means of inflexibly active, balanced, and inflexibly passive individuals revealed that balanced individuals did not display the highest level of validation, as had been expected. The findings from the present investigation support both the interpersonal and ideational flexibility components as described by Exner (2003) for inflexibly passive individuals. However, neither the interpersonal nor ideational flexibility components were supported regarding balanced and inflexibly active individuals. The findings from the present investigation suggest that although clinician's should use Exner's description of inflexibly passive individuals when interpreting the a:p ratio, they should exercise caution when using Exner's interpretive categories of balanced and inflexibly active individuals.

TI  - The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index demonstrates factor, construct and longitudinal validity
PY  - 2006
AB  - Background: The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-report measure developed to evaluate patients with shoulder pathology. While some validation has been conducted, broader analyses are indicated. This study determined aspects of cross-sectional and longitudinal validity of the SPADI.Methods: Community volunteers (n = 129) who self-identified as having shoulder pain were enrolled. Patients were examined by a physical therapist using a standardized assessment process to insure that their pain was musculoskeletal in nature. This included examination of pain reported during active and passive shoulder motion as reported on a visual analogue pain scale. Patients completed the SPADI, the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) at a baseline assessment and again 3 and 6 months later. Factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to assess subscale structure. Expectations regarding convergent and divergent subscales of CSQ and SIP were determined a priori and analysed using Pearson correlations. Constructed hypotheses that patients with a specific diagnosis or on pain medication would demonstrate higher SPADI scores were tested. Correlations between the observed changes recorded across different instruments were used to assess longitudinal validity.Results: The internal consistencies of the SPADI subscales were high (alpha > 0.92). Factor analysis with varimax rotation indicated that the majority of items fell into 2 factors that represent pain and disability. Two difficult functional items tended to align with pain items. Higher pain and disability was correlated to passive or negative coping strategies, i.e., praying/hoping, catastrophizing on the CSQ. The correlations between subscales of the SPADI and SIP were low with divergent subscales and low to moderate with convergent subscales. Correlations, r > 0.60, were observed between the SPADI and pain reported on a VAS pain scale during active and passive movement. The two constructed validity hypotheses (on diagnosis and use of pain medications) were both supported (p < 0.01). The SPADI demonstrated significant changes over time, but these were poorly correlated to the SIP or CSQ suggesting that these scales measure different parameters.Conclusion: The SPADI is a valid measure to assess pain and disability in community-based patients reporting shoulder pain due to musculoskeletal pathology.

TI  - The SmartVision navigation prototype for blind users
PY  - 2011
AB  - The goal of the Portuguese project SmartVision: active vision for the blind is to develop a small, portable and cheap yet intelligent and reliable system for assisting the blind and visually impaired while navigating autonomously, both in- and outdoor. In this article we present an overview of the prototype, design issues, and its different modules which integrate GPS and Wi-Fi localisation with a GIS, passive RFID tags, and computer vision. The prototype addresses global navigation for going to some destiny, by following known landmarks stored in the GIS in combination with path optimisation, and local navigation with path and obstacle detection just beyond the reach of the white cane. The system does not replace the white cane but complements it, in order to alert the user to looming hazards. In addition, computer vision is used to identify objects on shelves, for example in a pantry or refrigerator. The user-friendly interface consists of a four-button hand-held box, a vibration actuator in the handle of the white cane, and speech synthesis. In the near future, passive RFID tags will be complemented by active tags for marking navigation landmarks, and speech recognition may complement or substitute the vibration actuator.

It is a phenomenological analysis to analyze their socialization process of self formation through the course. The results show that self-formation in a college liberal arts course based on online culture experience is divided into static and dynamic perception stages. This study also makes possible the descriptive and expository discussion on the individual’s socialization process in the exchange of different experience on cultural content. The phenomenological analysis proved that a college liberal arts course based on cyberculture experience enables students to seek existence values at individual scale and relational scale. Therefore, in the technology-driven age moving into a information society it is to consider the importance of the socialization process performed through experiencing technology in college curriculum as well as technology education.

TI  - The Sound and Dynamics of Kim Soo-young's poems
PY  - 2018
AB  - In Kim Soo-young's poem, hearing is just as important as vision. Words that indicate hearing are the second most common after sight. This is why Kim Soo-young's poem should have sound as its subject. Sound is movement. Sound is a moving air, a wave that comes up to me. Sound and movement have to be connected. That is why sound is presented as a basis for dynamics. The previous dissertations were focused on noise, not the sound of Kim Soo-young’s sound. Noise is a particular aspect of sound. This paper focuses on the poetic function and meaning of sound, which is a more comprehensive concept than noise. We organize the entire aspect of sound, including noise, in Kim Soo-young's poem. In this paper we identify the poetic meaning and function of sound. The aspects of sound include not only the presence of sound, but also the absence of sound, ‘stillness' ‘silence.' This paper is selected as the subject of study not only when the word ‘sound’ is used alone, but also the compound word ‘~ sound’ combined with other words. The sounds used in Kim Soo-young's poem are varied and frequently used. Sound is an important material that continues to appear from early to late Kim's work. Sound, the subject and subject of hearing, plays a key role in Kim Soo-young's poetry. Sound is an unbroken motion that controls time duration. The sound is expressed as a specific sensory target of Kim's dynamic perception. Moving sound and static silence combine to create the dynamic of Kim Soo-young’s poems.

PY  - 2014
AB  - The study presents results of the opinion survey of Latvian State Revenue Service (SRS) employees, which was carried out with the aim to clarify the current level of satisfaction of the officers with their uniform and its structure and to identify the users' subjective, comfort describing the positive and negative feelings that arise wearing a specific clothing in certain environmental conditions. The results of the analysis of the survey presented the level of satisfaction with the existing everyday uniform and its structure and determined in what work environment and how long the respondents perform their service duties. It was determined that the most important qualities are of the everyday uniform are: convenience in dynamic conditions; functionality and dimensional stability after care; hygienic requirements, the convenience of elements (such as pockets, drawstrings, fasteners) and convenience in a static position. The survey clarified users' subjective comfort and provided the description of positive and negative feelings that arise wearing a specific clothing in certain environmental conditions. It was determined that 31.4% of men and 29.7% of women feel uncomfortable in their present uniforms in both indoor and outdoor application. The study provides recommendations that should be followed when designing new uniforms for the officers to improve the comfort level of the functional clothing. It was concluded that changes should be made in choosing the material for the uniforms as well as in designing in order to produce uniforms which are convenient for the consumer in dynamic motion, are warm but do not cause sweating, are representative for civil servants, are easy to clean and have aesthetic look after care.

AB  - A problem when comparing active and passive tactile perception of two-dimensional (2-D) stimuli is matching the active and passive tasks on all variables except the one of interest-active versus passive touch. A new computer-controlled device-the tactile display system (TDS)-has been developed to deal with this problem. The TDS tracks an "active" subject's fingertip movements during exploration of a raised line drawing and digitally records this spatio-temporal information. It then guides a passive participant's fingertip over the same path, matching for location and speed, Any difference in performance can thus be attributed to the different conditions (active versus passive) because other variables are held constant.

For this, we analyze the relationship between the screen door and the train, then derive the positional and visual elements which help to create efficient animated images. Based on this analysis, we made an example and applied into 3D program to confirm the implementation process of the animated PSD ads. As the result, the research shows that it is possible to produce a new type of PSD ads that can show dynamic visual effects and can give diversity to the PSD advertising media through the combination of the images using time difference.

TI  - The Technique of Productive Reading: Its Essence and Particularities in Pre-School- and School-Age Education
PY  - 2014
AB  - As creators of learning materials for children under school age as well as authors of textbooks on Russian language arts, readings in literature, and literary study for primary and secondary schools, we have been purposefully and systematically dealing with the tasks facing continuous literary education for over 15 years. At every level of education, our conception of the child reader is colored by considerations of independence in reading, initiative, capacity for active listening and understanding, readiness and ability to ask questions, to express judgments and opinions on those questions and issues that arise, to draw conclusions, since the productivity of reading rests on the degree to which these skills and qualities are formed. The cultivation of competent readers requires providing opportunities for thorough cognitive perception and understanding of text, for " experiencing " literary creations by readers of varying ages. This is possible if the preschool educator or schoolteacher possesses the means for systematically developing the reader within the child; that is, if one creates effective methodologies that take into the reading skills of children at various developmental stages. We undertook the development of methodological and technological pedagogical " equipment " with full consideration of recent scientific studies. Thus, in the study of the methodology of literary education (V. Bogdanova and others), cognitive perception of texts is understood to mean mental activity synthesizing thought, memory, and imagination as well as the child's emotions. Cognitive perception is a process requiring not passive contemplation, but active inner " acting-with " and " feeling-with " literary protagonists that expresses itself in the imaginary projection of events onto oneself. This, in turn, produces the effect of personal participation in fictional events. In general, cognitive perception of fiction by pre-school-aged children and young schoolchildren possesses the following characteristics: 1. Dominance of naïvely realistic interpretations in the independent reading and evaluation of texts. This " naïve realism " is naturally prevalent in the cognitive process of pre-school-aged-and younger schoolchildren. It leads to the conflation of art with reality and endows the child with emotional activeness, empathy, and the ability to form a holistic impression of literature, though the latter is rather schematic and at times not very logical. 2. Understanding the events in the text is a process of much greater intensity than is the work of creative imagination. 3. Emotional reactions far outpace other aspects of perception; often, they are not even motivated by the text itself.

TI  - The Temporal Interplay between Conscious and Unconscious Perceptual Streams
PY  - 2009
AB  - An optimal correspondence of temporal information between the physical world and our perceptual world is important for survival. In the current study, we demonstrate a novel temporal illusion in which the cause of a perceptual event is perceived after the event itself. We used a paradigm referred to as motion-induced blindness (MIB), in which a static visual target presented on a constantly rotating background disappears and reappears from awareness periodically [1-3], with the dynamic characteristics of bistable perception [4]. A sudden stimulus onset (e.g., a flash) presented during a period of perceptual suppression (i.e., during MIB) is known to trigger the almost instantaneous reappearance of the suppressed target [5]. Surprisingly, however, we report here that although the sudden flash is the cause of the static target's reappearance (the corresponding effect), it is systematically perceived as occurring after this reappearance. Further investigation revealed that this illusory temporal reversal is caused by an similar to 100 ms advantage for the unconscious representation of the perceptually suppressed target to access consciousness, as compared to the newly presented flash. This new temporal illusion therefore reveals the normally hidden delays in bringing new visual events to awareness.

TI  - The U.S. - Mexico Transborder Region: Cultural Dynamics and Historical Interactions
PY  - 2018
AB  - The U.S.-Mexico Transborder Region presents advanced anthropological theorizing of culture in an important regional setting. Not a static entity, the transborder region is peopled by ever-changing groups who face the challenges of social inequality: political enforcement of privilege, economic subordination of indigenous communities, and organized resistance to domination.
 
    The book, influenced by the work of Eric Wolf and senior editor Carlos G. Vélez-Ibáñez, centers on the greater Mexican North/U.S. Southwest, although the geographic range extends farther. This tradition, like other transborder approaches, attends to complex and fluid cultural and linguistic processes, going beyond the classical modern anthropological vision of one people, one culture, one language. With respect to recent approaches, however, it is more deeply social, focusing on vertical relations of power and horizontal bonds of mutuality.
 
    Vélez-Ibáñez and Heyman envision this region as involving diverse and unequal social groups in dynamic motion over thousands of years. Thus the historical interaction of the U.S.-Mexico border, however massively unequal and powerful, is only the most recent manifestation of this longer history and common ecology. Contributors emphasize the dynamic "transborder" quality—conflicts, resistance, slanting, displacements, and persistence—in order to combine a critical perspective on unequal power relations with a questioning perspective on claims to bounded simplicity and perfection.
 
    The book is notable for its high degree of connection across the various chapters, strengthened by internal syntheses from notable border scholars, including Robert R. Alvarez and Alejandro Lugo. In the final section, Judith Freidenberg draws general lessons from particular case studies, summarizing that "access to valued scarce resources prompts the erection of human differences that get solidified into borders," dividing and limiting, engendering vulnerabilities and marginalizing some people.
 
    At a time when understanding the U.S.-Mexico border is more important than ever, this volume offers a critical anthropological and historical approach to working in transborder regions.

TI  - The Under-compensatory Roll aVOR Does Not Affect Dynamic Visual Acuity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Rotations of the head evoke compensatory reflexive eye rotations in the orbit to stabilize images onto the fovea. In normal humans, the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) gain (eye/head velocity) changes depending on the head rotation plane. For pitch and yaw head rotations, the gain is near unity, but during roll head rotations, the aVOR gain is similar to 0.7. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this physiological discrepancy affects dynamic visual acuity (DVA)-a functional measure of the aVOR that requires subjects to identify letters of varying acuities during head rotation. We used the scleral search coil technique to measure eye and head velocity during passive DVA testing in yaw, roll, and pitch head impulses in healthy controls and patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH). For control subjects, the mean aVOR gain during roll impulses was significantly lower than the mean aVOR gain during yaw and pitch impulses; however, there was no difference in DVA between yaw, roll, or pitch. For subjects with UVH, only aVOR gain during head rotations toward the affected side (yaw) were asymmetric (ipsilesional, 0.32 +/- 0.17, vs. contralesional, 0.95 +/- 0.05), with no asymmetry during roll or pitch. Similarly, there was a large asymmetry for DVA only during yaw head rotations, with no asymmetry in roll or pitch. Interestingly, DVA during roll toward the affected ear was better than DVA during yaw toward the affected ear-even though the ipsilesional roll aVOR gain was 60 % lower. During roll, the axis of eye rotation remains nearly perpendicular to the fovea, resulting in minimal displacement between the fovea and fixation target image projected onto the back of the eye. For subjects with UVH, the DVA score during passive horizontal impulses is a better indicator of poor gaze stability than during passive roll or pitch.

TI  - The Validity of Physical Therapy Assessment of Low Back Pain via Telerehabilitation in a Clinical Setting
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:Back pain is a common and disabling condition for people in rural and remote areas. In these areas, access to rehabilitation services is limited by service availability. Telerehabilitation is suggested as a solution for providing physical therapy services; however, the validity of clinical assessment is largely unproven. The aim of this study was to establish the validity of clinically pragmatic remote assessment of spinal posture, active movements of the lumbar spine, and the passive straight leg raise (SLR) test.Subjects and Methods:Face-to-face physical therapist assessment was compared with telerehabilitation assessment of spinal posture, active movements of the lumbar spine, and the SLR test. Twenty-six participants recruited from a rural population with current or recent low back pain (LBP) were assessed by a face-to-face physical therapist and a remote physical therapist. Pain, disability, and clinical measurements were assessed. Outcomes were compared to establish agreement.Results:High levels of agreement were found with detecting pain with specific lumbar movements, eliciting symptoms, and sensitizing the SLR test. Moderate agreement occurred with identifying the worst lumbar spine movement direction, SLR range of motion, and active lumbar spine range of motion. Poor agreement occurred with postural analysis and identifying reasons for limitations to lumbar movements.Conclusions:Conducted in a rural clinical setting, this study validates elements of the physical assessment of the lumbar spine and identifies technical and clinical issues to be addressed by future research. Important components of the standard musculoskeletal assessment of LBP are valid via telerehabilitation in a clinical setting.

TI  - The Ventral Posterior Lateral Thalamus Preferentially Encodes Externally Applied Versus Active Movement: Implications for Self-Motion Perception
PY  - 2019
AB  - Successful interaction with our environment requires that voluntary behaviors be precisely coordinated with our perception of self-motion. The vestibular sensors in the inner ear detect self-motion and in turn send projections via the vestibular nuclei to multiple cortical areas through 2 principal thalamocortical pathways, 1 anterior and 1 posterior. While the anterior pathway has been extensively studied, the role of the posterior pathway is not well understood. Accordingly, here we recorded responses from individual neurons in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus of macaque monkeys during externally applied (passive) and actively generated self-motion. The sensory responses of neurons that robustly encoded passive rotations and translations were canceled during comparable voluntary movement (similar to 80% reduction). Moreover, when both passive and active self-motion were experienced simultaneously, neurons selectively encoded the detailed time course of the passive component. To examine the mechanism underlying the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active motion, we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement. We found that suppression only occurred if the actual sensory consequences of motion matched the motor-based expectation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the posterior thalamocortical vestibular pathway selectively encodes unexpected motion, thereby providing a neural correlate for ensuring perceptual stability during active versus externally generated motion.

TI  - The Virtual Hand Illusion and body ownership
PY  - 2008
AB  - The illusion described here is well documented, and known as the rubber hand illusion (RHI). It is used to investigate perceptual processes and multisensory interactions. In the presented study we aimed to achieve the projected sensation using a paradigm designed to achieve a Virtual Hand Illusion (VHI). This allowed the exploration of novel stimuli including passive and active movement of the arm, self stimulus and haptic stimuli other than just brushing. Our results showed similar effects to the original RHI and demonstrated the advantage of active haptic stimulation for enhancement of body ownership.

TI  - The ability to reason about movement in the visual field
PY  - 1988
AB  - In tests of visual-spatial reasoning, the examinee must reason about some aspect of a picture. Because of the limitations of paper-and-pencil tests, the picture do not contain any moving elements. These are referred to as static displays. Outside the test situation, people frequently have to reason about visual displays that contain moving elements. These will be called dynamic displays. This experiment investigated whether or not individual differences in the ability to reason about dynamic displays are predictable from tests using static displays. One hundred and seventy people were given a battery of tests, including six standard paper-and-pencil tests of visual-spatial ability, five computer-controlled tests using static displays, and six computer-controlled tests using dynamic displays. Several multivariate analyses indicated that the ability to reason about dynamic visual motion is distinct from the ability to reason about static displays. © 1988.

TI  - The adaptability of self-action perception and movement control when the limb is passively versus actively moved
PY  - 2012
AB  - Research suggests that perceptual experience of our movements adapts together with movement control when we are the agents of our actions. Is this agency critical for perceptual and motor adaptation? We had participants view cursor feedback during elbow extension-flexion movements when they (1) actively moved their arm, or (2) had their arm passively moved. We probed adaptation of movement perception by having participants report the reversal point of their unseen movement. We probed adaptation of movement control by having them aim to a target. Perception and control of active movement were influenced by both types of exposure, although adaptation was stronger following active exposure. Furthermore, both types of exposure led to a change in the perception of passive movements. Our findings support the notion that perception and control adapt together, and they suggest that some adaptation is due to recalibrated proprioception that arises independently of active engagement with the environment.

TI  - The aerodynamics of forebodies undergoing longitudinal motion
PY  - 1999
AB  - A low-speed wind tunnel investigation was conducted to investigate the aerodynamics of a forebody undergoing pitch oscillations. Two different 3.5 tangeni: ogive forebodies (axisymmetric and chined cross-section) were pitched sinusoidally through an angle of attack range of 0-90° and 0-45° at a Reynolds number of 76,300. Force balance data was acquired to resolve the aerodynamic loads for static and dynamic testing. The data indicates that during the dynamic motion the developed aerodynamic loads are a function of the forebody cross-section, the upstroke/downstroke portion of the cycle, and the amplitude of the motion. © 1999 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics.

TI  - The amputation stump and its rehabilitation
PY  - 1974
AB  - Rehabilitation after amputation includes 3 well defined stages: postoperative recuperation; adaptation with respect to the prosthesis, with training for its use and the subsequent functional reeducation; occupational rehabilitation. This paper is concerned with the first stage. Postoperative physiotherapy has the fundamental objective of toning the muscles of the stump and preventing articular rigidity and muscular retraction. Retractions are prevented by adequate postural treatment of the patient starting from the first postoperative moments, for example, an arm maintained in abduction at 60° with intermediate rotation in the frontal plane. Amputees losing lower limbs can carry out continuous traction in the phase of cicatrization, thus avoiding thigh flexion. Physiotherapy stresses exercises of adduction and extension. Since muscular contraction occurs at an early stage, it is advisable to commence passive physiotherapy and isometric contractions of the stump within 48 hr of amputation. Once cicatrization has been achieved, active movements are used to achieve maximal articular mobility. In the post cicatrization stage, massage and thermotherapy complement repeated static contractions in the process of promoting trophicity and a good vascular status. The following phase is the development of the stump musculature by progressive exercise of the muscle groups using manual or mechanical resistance. Bandaging of the stump prevents edema but also aids in the general molding of the stump itself. (Ballarin - Barcelona)

TI  - The analysis of composite foundation with CFG and gravel piles to resist soil liquefaction
PY  - 2008
AB  - Based on a practical engineering project (in Inner Mongolia), which uses composite foundation with CFG & gravel piles to deal with the soil liquefaction, the composite foundation's capacity and function mechanism are analyzed in the paper. And the design, construction effect and test results of the composite foundation are also discussed. The test results presented in the paper can be applied to the similar projects in the region of Inner Mongolia. These include the experimental parameters of the composite foundation, the test results of the carrying capacity of single pile vertical. static load and heavy dynamic touch test, the test results of the pile's quality affected by low stain dynamic test and the test results of standard penetration experiment. The following conclusions can be reached from the analysis of the test results mentioned above: (1) That the engineering project involved in the paper has gotten good reinforcement effect shows that the application of the composite foundation to resisting soil liquefaction is successful, which sets an example for widely application of the composite foundation with CFG and gravel piles to treating the soil liquefaction of foundations; (2) The composite foundation with CFG and gravel piles has the functions of quickening up the soil's drainage and consolidation; and (3) During the construction of the composite foundation, the dynamical load and the shock absorption function of the piles can increase soil's density, and thereby abate or clear up soil liquefaction.

TI  - The ankle and subtalar joints
PY  - 1982
AB  - The ankle and subtalar joint act together to provide a universal-joint type of linkage between the foot and leg, plantar flexion and inversion occurring together as do dorsiflexion and eversion of the hind foot. There was a small mean decrease with age in active and passive subtalar movement for eversion and inversion but this reduction was less than might have been expected; for active subtalar movement the mean of inversion decreased by 5° and eversion by 9°. There was no difference between the range of passive movement in men and women. For active subtalar movement there was minimal difference in inversion for the fourth and fifth decades, but for active subtalar eversion the males aged between 11 and 10 years were much more mobile than the females. Both active and passive ankle movements showed some decrease with age, but it is noticeable that it is particularly the active and passive ankle plantar flexion that decreases with age, the difference in means of the former being 13.5° and of the latter 11°. Dorsiflexion was slightly greater in the males for the 41-70 age groups but the females had highly significant increase in plantar flexion from age 21 to 70 years, probably related to the heel height of their footwear.

TI  - The antennal movement apparatus in the small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae L., Insecta, Lepidoptera)
PY  - 1978
AB  - 1. The club-shaped antenna of Aglais urticae L. consists of 34-37 segments (scape, pedicel, and flagellar segments; Fig. 1) covered by hairs and scales (Fig. 4a). Only the scape and the pedicel can be moved by muscles (Fig. 6). 2. The head-scape joint may be compared to a ball-and-socket joint. The scape can be moved in various directions by four muscles of the head (Fig. 6a). The scape-pedicel joint functions like a hinge joint, about which axis G3-G4 the pedicel together with the flagellum can be turned upwards by one muscle and downwards by two muscles of the scape (Figs. 6b and 7). This axis, when the antenna is in resting position, makes an angle of ca. 40° (pointing forwards) with the longitudinal body axis when projected into the horizontal plane (Fig. 14). 3. The pedicel-flagellum joint, as all the successive joints, is of almost radial symmetry (Fig. 2). The flagellar segments can only be moved passively by a relatively small amount. 4. Aglais has in its pedicel a highly developed Johnston's organ (Figs. 8-10), the sense cells of which can probably perceive passive movements of the flagellum in relation to the pedicel. The active movements of the antenna can be controlled by Böhm's bristles on the scape and the pedicel (Figs. 3-7). 5. The Johnston's organ, the Böhm's bristles and the antennal muscles are supplied by nerves which arise in the deutocerebrum (Figs. 11 and 12). 6. During flight the antennae are stretched forward almost horizontally (Fig. 1). The adjustment of this antennal flight position is discussed (Figs. 13 and 14). © 1978 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The anxiolytic buspirone shifts coping strategy in novel environmental context of mice with different anxious phenotype
PY  - 2013
AB  - Patients suffering from anxiety disorders show increased fear when encounter a novel environment. Rodents, placed in new environmental context may respond either with increased novelty seeking (active), or enhanced anxiety (passive coping style), which may depend on the trait anxiety of the animal. Here, the connection between the initial level of anxiety and the behavioral responses in a novel environment was investigated. Two inbred mouse strains having either high- or low-anxiety related behavior (AX and nAX) were exposed to elevated plus maze (EPM), a standard test for assessing anxiety level, for 8 consecutive days. The initial anxiety level was modulated by chronic treatment with buspirone (bus) treatment, a clinically effective anxiolytic, using 2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg doses. Both strains showed a gradual decrease of open-arm exploration, which was not prevented by bus treatment. Another cohort of animals was exposed to EPM for 2 days, and then we changed to blue light illumination and used a different cleaning substance with citrus odor (context change, CC). It was found that upon CC AX mice exhibited increased, while nAX mice showed decreased anxiety. Bus in 2.5 mg/kg changed the coping strategy from passive to active exploration after CC in the AX mice; however, the same treatment rendered nAX mice passive upon CC. Bus in 5.0 mg/kg failed to alter the overall coping style in the novel environment of both strains. These results suggest that these mouse lines use different coping strategy in novel context, which can be changed with bus treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The assessment of imagery and visuo-spatial working memory functions in children and adults
PY  - 2006
AB  - Experimental evidence has shown the involvement of visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) in a large number of every-day tasks, such as generation, maintenance and transformation of visual mental images (Kosslyn 1980), processing of visual and spatial coordinates (Hanley, Young & Pearson 1991), map learning and navigation (Denis, Daniel, Fontaine & Pazzaglia 2001; Garden, Cornoldi & Logie 2002), drawing and memory for the positioning of objects (Postma & De Haan 1996; Zimmer, Speiser, & Seidler 2003). In Baddeley’s (1986) original model the system responsible for the storage and processing of non-verbal information was the visuo-spatial sketchpad, or, following the naming used in more recent models (Logie 1995; Cornoldi & Vecchi 2003), visuospatial working memory (VSWM). Although there is converging evidence supporting the multi-componential nature of the VSWM, so far there is no agreement on the number and identity of its components. For example, Logie (1995) distinguished between the visual cache, which temporarily stores visual information (i.e. memory for objects, shapes or colours) and the inner scribe, for the rehearsal of motor spatial sequences.Neuroanatomical data provide support for the distinction between a spatial and a visual component: Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982) proved that the primates’ visual system can be differentiated in a “where” system, or dorsal stream, processing spatial information and a “what” system, or ventral stream, processing the features of perceived objects. Spatial-storage tasks activate cells in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ofmonkeys, while object-storage tasks activate cells in amore ventral region of the prefrontal cortex (see Smith & Jonides 1999, for a review).Walsh, Ellison, Battelli and Cowey (1998), in a study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), reported that subjects’ performance was disrupted by TMS applied over cortical area V5, when the task required attention to motion, but was improved when motion processing was irrelevant. Studies using the dual-task paradigm showed that retention of visual shapes or colours is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures (Logie & Marchetti 1991) or by dynamic visual noise (Quinn & McConnell 1996), whereas retention of location is interfered with by spatial tracking tasks (Baddeley & Lieberman 1980), spatial tapping tasks (Della Sala, Gray, Baddeley, Allamano & Wilson 1999) and eye movement (Postle, Idzikowski, Della Sala, Logie, & Baddeley 2006). This fractionation between the visual and spatial working memory components is also corroborated by neuropsychological evidence from patients showing a selective deficit in the performance of either visual or spatial working memory tasks (Carlesimo, Perri, Turriziani, Tomaiuolo, & Caltagirone 2001; Luzzatti, Vecchi, Agazzi, Cesa-Bianchi, & Vergani 1998; Farah, Hammond, Levine, & Calvanio 1988). Moreover, regarding memory for object location, a further distinction was made; according to Postma and De Haan (1996), the object location memory can be subdivided into three separate processes: the first process requires encodingmetric information and the coordinates of a particular object located in the environment, the second process, called object-location binding, requires linking the object’s identity to the its position; finally, the last process integrates the first two mechanisms and combines metric information with object identity and location (Kessels, De Haan, Kappelle, & Postma 2002a; Kessels, Kappelle, De Haan & Postma 2002b). This distinction is in agreement with that made by Kosslyn (1987) between exact metric coordinates encoding and memory for the relative relation between objects (see also Landsdale 1998). Furthermore, studies regarding the specialized involvement of different brain structures shows that the right hemisphere is important in processing metric spatial information, whereas the left hemisphere participates in processing relative spatial relations (Kosslyn, Koenig, Barett, & Cave 1989). Another fractionation in VSWM processing was suggested by Pickering, Gathercole, Hall and Lloyd (2001). The authors distinguish between a static format, as for example in a matrix in which locations are presented simultaneously, and a dynamic format, like in the Corsi test (Corsi 1972), where the reproduction of moving paths between blocks is required. In their studies, participants were presented with matrix and maze tasks in either a static or a dynamic format. The static version of both tasks involved the presentation of static images on matrices or mazes, whilst the dynamic version involved the presentation of squares presented one at a time in a matrix, or required remembering a route traced by the experimenter in a maze. A developmental fractionation in performance was found for static and dynamic conditions, suggesting that a critical distinction may concern not the visual and spatial properties of the tests, but the static and dynamic nature of the tasks, that tap different subcomponents of VSWM. Recently, Lecerf and de Ribaupierre (2005) proposed the existence of a different way of processing visuospatial stimuli: extrinsic encoding important for anchoring objects with respect to an external frame and intrinsic encoding based on the relation among items within a complex pattern. The latter involves a pattern encoding, which leads to a global image of the stimulus and a path encoding, related to spatialsequential links created between different positions. Both static vs. dynamic (Pickering et al. 2001) and pattern encoding vs. path encoding (Lecerf & de Ribaupierre 2005) share similarities with the distinction made by Pazzaglia and Cornoldi (1999) between spatial-sequential and spatial-simultaneous processing: a spatial-sequential task requires recalling spatial positions presented in a sequential format, i.e. one at a time following the presentation order, whereas in a spatial-simultaneous task all the participants have to recall positions presented simultaneously. They distinguished these two spatial components from a visual one in which participants have to memorize objects with different shapes, colours and textures. These components are located in the horizontal continuum of Cornoldi and Vecchi’s continuity model (2000, 2003) which depends on the different types of material used in a task and, therefore, involves the distinction between visual, spatial-sequential and spatial-simultaneous tasks. The continuity model hypothesized another dimension, i.e. the vertical continuum, involved in all tasks but requiring different degrees of active control; in this framework a visual or a spatial-sequential task might be passive, if for example the task requires recalling the visual properties of a picture, or a pathway, but may be active, if the task requires subjects to actively manipulate the memory material in order to produce an output different from the original input. In other words, the continuity model proposes that each task could vary not only with respect to content-dependent processes, but also with respect to the position in the vertical continuum, i.e. the degree of control necessary to perform it. The architecture of the VSWM is therefore still questionable and any of the proposed viewpoints may be considered as definitive; moreover, for each model different tests have been used leading to different results. For this reason, the specific choice of tasks for the assessment of VSWM may be critical and there is need for the identification and classification of VSWMtasks. In the next paragraphs we will review tests used to assess VSWMand imagery and we will then focus on our VSWMbattery.

AB  - This study examines the association between dimensions of ECR (attachment-related avoidance and anxiety) and the Rorschach Oral Dependency scale (Bornstein &amp; Masling, 2005) on a sample of Czech adults. It points out the association between ECR and relevant Rorschach CS variables (Exner, 2003). Our research sample consists of 31 volunteers from the Czech Republic. The average age of the participants was 24.9 years, the age range from 19 to 47 years. The results indicate that attachment anxiety measured by ECR is significantly associated with the ROD score, but elaborated correlations between the ROD score and attachment anxiety show a significant association only in the group of participants without psychiatric or psychological care in their past (n = 18; r = 0.683, p &lt; .01). There were no significant correlations between self-reported attachment dimensions and the selected CS variables (textures, active and passive movements, food). Our findings seem to be consistent with the attachment theory—people with high level of attachment anxiety are often described as dependent. We discuss our findings with regards to the discrepancy between self-report measures and performance based tools.

TI  - The association between unilateral heel-rise performance with static and dynamic balance in community dwelling older adults
PY  - 2015
AB  - As a measure of both strength and muscle endurance of the plantar flexors, the unilateral heel rise (UHR) test has been suggested as a method to evaluate balance capabilities in older adults. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between UHR performance with biomechanical measures of balance in seniors. Twenty-two older adults completed two testing sessions. The first visit included UHR performance; the second visit included dynamic and static motion analysis. UHR performance was significantly associated with dynamic balance capability as measured by medial-lateral inclination angle during gait. As indicated by an analysis of center of pressure, there were significant associations between UHR performance and measures of static balance. Balance is influenced by plantar flexor performance as measured by the UHR test. We therefore suggest incorporating the UHR test in analyses of balance in seniors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The association of noise sensitivity with music listening, training, and aptitude
PY  - 2015
AB  - After intensive, long-term musical training, the auditory system of a musician is specifically tuned to perceive musical sounds. We wished to find out whether a musicians auditory system also develops increased sensitivity to any sound of everyday life, experiencing them as noise. For this purpose, an online survey, including questionnaires on noise sensitivity, musical background, and listening tests for assessing musical aptitude, was administered to 197 participants in Finland and Italy. Subjective noise sensitivity (assessed with the Weinsteins Noise Sensitivity Scale) was analyzed for associations with musicianship, musical aptitude, weekly time spent listening to music, and the importance of music in each persons life (or music importance). Subjects were divided into three groups according to their musical expertise: Nonmusicians (N = 103), amateur musicians (N = 44), and professional musicians (N = 50). The results showed that noise sensitivity did not depend on musical expertise or performance on musicality tests or the amount of active (attentive) listening to music. In contrast, it was associated with daily passive listening to music, so that individuals with higher noise sensitivity spent less time in passive (background) listening to music than those with lower sensitivity to noise. Furthermore, noise-sensitive respondents rated music as less important in their life than did individuals with lower sensitivity to noise. The results demonstrate that the special sensitivity of the auditory system derived from musical training does not lead to increased irritability from unwanted sounds. However, the disposition to tolerate contingent musical backgrounds in everyday life depends on the individuals noise sensitivity.

TI  - The auditory oddball paradigm revised to improve bedside detection of consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive patients
PY  - 2017
AB  - Active paradigms requiring subjects to engage in a mental task on request have been developed to detect consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive patients. Using auditory ERPs, the active condition consists in orienting patient's attention toward oddball stimuli. In comparison with passive listening, larger P300 in the active condition identifies voluntary processes. However, contrast between these two conditions is usually too weak to be detected at the individual level. To improve test sensitivity, we propose as a control condition to actively divert the subject's attention from the auditory stimuli with a mental imagery task that has been demonstrated to be within the grasp of the targeted patients: navigate in one's home. Twenty healthy subjects were presented with a two-tone oddball paradigm in the three following condition: (a) passive listening, (b) mental imagery, (c) silent counting of deviant stimuli. Mental imagery proved to be more efficient than passive listening to lessen P300 response to deviant tones as compared with the active counting condition. An effect of attention manipulation (oriented vs. diverted) was observed in 19/20 subjects, of whom 18 showed the expected P300 effect and 1 showed an effect restricted to the N2 component. The only subject showing no effect also proved insufficient engagement in the tasks. Our study demonstrated the efficiency of diverting attention using mental imagery to improve the sensitivity of the active oddball paradigm. Using recorded instructions and requiring a small number of electrodes, the test was designed to be conveniently and economically used at the patient's bedside.

TI  - The avulsion of subclavian artery from brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian vein from right brachiocephalic vein with brachial plexus injury [Oderwanie tetnicy podobojczykowej od pnia ramienno-głowowego i zyły podobojczykowej od prawej zyły ramienno-głowowej z uszkodzeniem splotu ramiennego]
PY  - 2013
AB  - UNLABELLED: The detachment of subclavian artery from brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian vein from right brachiocephalic vein with brachial plexus injury.INTRODUCTION: Traumas of large vessels of mediastinal and shoulder girdle cause significant life risk and constitute serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems because of lack of time for accurate treatment planning. Particularly difficult to treat are blunt trauma of large arteries in patients under the influence of drugs or with a progressive hypovolemic shock.AIM: The aim of this dissertation is presenting my own experience in treating a seventeen-year-old motorcyclist who was under the influence of alcohol suffered a detachment of subclavian artery and subclavian vein from mediastinal large vessels following a traffic accident.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen-year-old motorcyclist who was under the influence of alcohol alcohol hit a concrete pole at a speed of 130 km/h. The patient was brought to the hospital in a state of hypovolemic shock, pulse 126/min, blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, without pulse on the right upper limb. The right upper limb was cold, without active movements, pressure and pain sense. The right shoulder was tumid. The right lung without audible murmurs. Pulses on carotid arteries were perceptible. The thoracic plain film x-ray showed a shading on right half of thorax, widening of the upper mediastinum, fracture of right clavicle and the rear right shoulder sprain. Passive movements in the right elbow were correct. The patient was taken to the operating theatre because of progressive hypovolemic shock and was operated in emergency regimen. The transverse thoracotomy was made by both the intercostals spaces between the second and third rib. The thoracotomy showed that subclavian artery from brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian vein from right brachiocephalic vein were detachment. The subclavian vein was ligated and the brachiocephalic vein was sewn (phleborrhaphy). The subclavian artery was connected with brachiocephalic trunk by a synthetic vascular graft so that the received pulse at the periphery of the upper limb. The thyrocervical trunk, costocervical trunk and damaged intercostal vessels at the first, second and third rib were also ligated. The sprained shoulder was set. During the operation, there was no sight that even one of fascicles of brachial plexus was interrupted. The next day pateint was reoperated because of hemorrhage to right pleura. The rest of intercostal vessels at the first, second and third rib were ligated.RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful surgery. After operation was found that ulnar and radial nerve were demaged. The right lung expansion was achieved, upper limb had pulse, wounds healed as needed. The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical treatment.CONCLUSION: The quick decision to conduct operations without accurate diagnosis was the only factor for patient survival.

TI  - The biological effect of continuous passive motion on the healing of full-thickness defects in articular cartilage. An experimental investigation in the rabbit
PY  - 1980
AB  - A new concept, continuous passive motion of a synovial joint in vivo, was investigated to determine its biological effect on the healing of full-thickness articular cartilage defects that penetrate the subchondral bone of knee joints of adolescent and adult rabbits. The effect of continuous passive motion was compared with the effects of immobilization and of intermittent active motion. This investigation included assessment of 480 defects in the knees of 120 adolescent rabbits and assessment of 108 defects in the knees of twenty-seven adult rabbits. The continuous passive motion was well tolerated by these animals, whose general well-being was undisturbed. The healing of the defects at weekly intervals up to four weeks was assessed by gross examination and by an analysis of two indices of healing determined by light microscopy: (1) the nature of the reparative tissue, and (2) the degree of metachromasia of the matrix as demonstrated by toluidine-blue staining. At three weeks this assessment revealed that in the adolescent rabbits, healing of the defects by hyaline articular cartilage was present in 8 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were immobilized, in 9 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were permitted intermittent active motion, and in 52 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were managed immediately after operation by continuous passive motion. At three weeks, in the adult animals, healing of the defects by hyaline articular cartilage was present in 3 per cent of thirty-six defects in nine animals whose knees were immobilized, in 5 per cent of thirty-six defects in nine animals whose knees were permitted intermittent active motion, and in 44 per cent of thirty-six defects in nine animals whose knees were managed immediately after operation by continuous passive motion. Thus, the metaplasia of the healing tissue within the defects from undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue to hyaline articular cartilage was not only much more rapid but also much more complete with continuous passive motion than with either immobilization or intermittent active motion. Clinical Relevance: The results of the present investigation emphasize that neither immobilization nor intermittent active motion provides an adequate stimulus for the healing of full-thickness defects by articular cartilage. Although the biological effect of continuous passive motion on the healing of such defects was strikingly beneficial, it must be emphasized that none of the rabbits was allowed to resume normal activity after the completion of the experiment, which lasted for from one to four weeks. Thus, it remains to be determined whether or not the integrity of this newly formed reparative tissue will be maintained when it is subjected to normal weight-bearing activity for long periods.

TI  - The boundaries of river systems: the metazoan perspective
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. This overview of metazoans associated with the riparian/groundwater interface focuses on the fauna inhabiting substratum interstices within the stream bed and in alluvial aquifers beneath the floodplain. The objective is to integrate knowledge of habitat conditions and ecology of the interstitial fauna into a broad spatiotemporal perspective of lotic ecosystems.2. Most aquatic metazoans of terrestrial ancestry, secondarily aquatic forms including insects and water mites (Hydracarina), are largely confined to surface waters (epigean), most of the time penetrating only the superficial interstices of the stream bed.3. Primary aquatic metazoans include crustaceans and other groups whose entire evolutionary histories took place in water. Some species are epigean, whereas other members of the primary aquatic fauna are true subterranean forms (hypogean), residing deep within the stream bed and in alluvial aquifers some distance laterally from the channel.4. The hypogean/epigean affinities of interstitial animals are reflected in repetitive gradients of species distribution patterns along vertical (depth within the stream bed), longitudinal (riffle/pool), and lateral (across the floodplain) spatial dimensions, as well as along recovery trajectories following floods (temporal dimension).5. Fluvial dynamics and sediment characteristics interact to determine hydraulic conductivity, oxygen levels, pore space, particle size heterogeneity, organic content and other habitat conditions within the interstitial milieu.6. Multidimensional environmental gradients occur at various scales across riparian/ groundwater boundary zones. The spatiotemporal variability of hydrogeomorphological processes plays an important role in determining habitat heterogeneity, habitat stability, and connectivity between habitat patches, thereby structuring biodiversity patterns across the riverine landscape.7. The erosive action of flooding maintains a diversity of hydrarch and riparian successional stages in alluvial floodplains. The patchy distribution patterns of interstitial communities at the floodplain scale reflect, in part, the spatial heterogeneity engendered by successional processes.8. Interstitial metazoans engage in passive and active movements between surface waters and ground waters, between aquatic and riparian habitats, and between different habitat types within the lotic system. Some of these are extensive migrations that involve significant exchange of organic matter and energy between ecosystem compartments.9. The generally high resilience of lotic ecosystems to disturbance is attributable, in part, to high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Habitat patches less affected by a particular perturbation may serve as 'refugia' from which survivors recolonize more severely affected areas. Mechanisms of refugium use may also occur within habitats, as, for example, through ontogenetic shifts in microhabitat use. Rigorous investigations of interstitial habitats as refugia should lead to a clearer understanding of the roles of disturbance and stochasticity in lotic ecosystems.10. Development of realistic 'whole river' food webs have been constrained by the exclusion of interstitial metazoans, which may in fact contribute the majority of energy flow in lotic ecosystems. A related problem is failure to include groundwater/riparian habitats as integral components of alluvial rivers. A conceptual model is presented that integrates groundwater and riparian systems into riverine food webs and that reflects the spatiotemporal complexity of the physical system and connectivity between different components.11. Interstitial metazoans also serve as 'ecosystem engineers,' by influencing the availability of resouces to other species and by modifying habitat conditions within the sediment. For example, by grazing on biofilm, interstitial animals may markedly stimulate bacterial growth rates and nutrient dynamics.12. Although there has been a recent surge of interest in the role of interstitial animals in running waters, the knowledge gays are vast. For example, basic environmental requirements of the majority of groundwater metazoans remain uninvestigated. Virtually nothing is known regarding the role of biotic interactions in structuring faunal distribution patterns across groundwater/riparian boundary zones. Interstitial metazoans may contribute significantly to the total productivity and energy flow of the biosphere, but such data are not available. Nor are sufficient data available to determine the contribution of groundwater animals to estimates of global biodiversity.13. Effective ecosystem management must include groundwater/riparian ecotones and interstitial metazoans in monitoring and restoration efforts. Evidence suggests that a 'connected' groundwater/riparian system provides natural pollution control, prevents clogging of sediment interstices and maintains high levels of habitat heterogeneity and successional stage diversity. River protection and restoration should maintain or re-establish at least a portion of the natural fluvial dynamics that sustains the ecological integrity of the entire riverine-floodplain-aquifer ecosystem.

TI  - The case for haptic props: Shape, weight and vibro-tactile feedback
PY  - 2019
AB  - The use of haptic props in a virtual environment setting is purported to improve both user immersion and task performance. While the efficacy of various forms of haptics has been tested through user experiments, this is not the case for hand-held tool props, an important class of input device with both gaming and non-gaming applications. From a cost and complexity of implementation perspective it is also worth investigating the relative benefits of the different types of passive and active haptics that can be incorporated into such props. Accordingly, in this paper we present the results of a quantitative user experiment (n = 42) designed to assess a typical VR controller against passive, weighted, and active-haptic versions of a tracked prop, measured according to game experience, performance, and stance adopted by participants. The task involved playing a VR baseball game and the prop was a truncated baseball bat. We found a statistically significant improvement (at α = 0.05) with medium to large effect size (r > 0.38) for certain aspects of game experience (competence, immersion, flow, positive affect), performance (mean hit distance) and pose (two-handed grip) for the weighted prop over a generic controller, and in many cases over the unweighted passive prop as well. There was no significant difference between our weighted prop and the active-haptic version. This suggests that, for batting and striking tasks, tool props with passive haptics improve user experience and task performance but only if they match the weight of the original real-world tool, and that such weighting is more important than simple vibro-tactile style force-feedback.

TI  - The cerebellum contributes to proprioception during motion
PY  - 2017
AB  - Proprioception, the sense of limb position and motion, is essential for generating accurate movements. Limb position sense has typically been studied under static conditions (i.e., the fixed position of a limb in space), with less known about dynamic position sense (i.e., limb position during movement). Here we investigated how a person's estimate of hand position varies when using spatial or temporal information to judge the unseen hand's location during reaching. We assessed the acuity of dynamic position sense in two directions, orthogonal to hand movement, which only requires spatial information, and in line with hand movement, which has both spatial and temporal components. Our results showed that people have better proprioceptive acuity in the orthogonal condition where only spatial information is used. We then assessed whether cerebellar damage impairs proprioceptive acuity in both tasks during passive and active movement. Cerebellar patients showed reduced acuity in both tasks and in both movement conditions relative to age-matched controls. However, patients' deficits were most apparent when judgments of active movement relied on temporal information. Furthermore, both cerebellar patient and control performance correlated with the trialto-trial variability of their active movements: subjects are worse at the proprioceptive tasks when movements are variable. Our results suggest that, during active movements, proprioceptive acuity may be reliant on the motor system's ability to predict motor output. Therefore, the resultant proprioceptive deficits occurring after cerebellar damage may be related to a more general impairment in movement prediction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We assessed limb position sense during movement in patients with cerebellar damage and found deficits in proprioceptive acuity during both passive and active movement. The effect of cerebellar damage was most apparent when individuals relied on both timing and spatial information during active movement. Thus proprioceptive acuity during active movements may be reliant on the motor system's ability to predict motor output.

TI  - The challenge to manage reflex sympathetic dystrophy/complex regional pain syndrome
PY  - 2005
AB  - Can one prevent RSD? Certainly not in every situation because some highly predisposed patients apparently develop the disorder spontaneously. Empirical observation has convinced many that on recognition of the earliest signs (eg, disproportionate pain, swelling, vasomotor instability, and so forth), immediate therapeutic intervention may obviate development in some patients. One cannot expect consistently to prevent such a poorly understood disorder; however, there are six measures that may hopefully reduce the possibility of RSD. 1. Communication. As early as 1942, Miller suggested that a significant preventive factor is communication with the patient, expressing reassurance of support and assistance for relief of his or her anxiety and pain [264]. 2. Early active motion. Early active motion and function within the patient's pain threshold should be encouraged. Newer methods of management, such as relative motion splinting that permits immediate active motion after long extensor repair or sagittal band rupture [265], or secure plate fracture fixation and early active motion [266], do much to discourage the self-victimization that accompanies immobilization and seems related to RSD. 3. Avoid external fixation. Whenever possible, prolonged use of external fixation should be avoided [146]. One report noted development of RSD in 9.8% of patients after external fixation of distal radius wrist fractures and a 5.5% incidence after external minifixation in the hand. An even higher incidence was suggested in patients with distraction external fixation. If RSD-CRPS symptoms arise, abandon external fixation in favor of immobilization. 4. Remove painful casts. Remove any cast or splint that the patient believes is too tight or is causing pain. In general, RSD is more common in patients who are immobilized, and perception by the patient that a tight cast is causing their symptoms is frequent, even though the clinician may find no evidence on physical inspection. Nonetheless, the cast should be removed and replaced as often as necessary to rid the patient of burning, incessant pain. If unrelenting pain continues, it is appropriate to abandon immobilization completely (other than perhaps a soft dressing), but only after a physical examination to be certain that there is no other explanation for the pain (eg, acute carpal tunnel syndrome, infection, or ischemia) and thorough communication with the patient about the need to control the pain have taken place. Whenever the patient has subjective relief, the immobilization can be gently replaced. The patient is likely to have better function despite a nonunion or tendon rupture than he or she would ever have with the disaster of late RSD. 5. Avoid painful therapy. Avoid measures that increase inflammation. For example, avoid painful, forced passive range-of-motion therapy or dynamic splints until acute inflammation subsides. Pain is the indication to limit passive forced motion, which should remain within a relatively pain-free range. 6. Block patients with a history of RSD. Patients with a history of RSD are at greater risk for recurrence [194]. When surgery is necessary in such a patient, a long-acting block of the operative area should be performed before any incision is made, even under a general anesthetic. Keep the CNS unaware of the procedure as long as possible to avoid recurrence of the reflex or cycle of pain. Recurrent or migratory RSD is reported to occur in 15% to 75% of RSD-CRPS patients [36,45,46,51-54]. The study of RSD-CRPS brings into sharp focus the poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interrelationship of CNS physiology and hand function and reminds one of the large amount of cerebral cortex dedicated to hand activity. Once this challenge is unraveled, Pulvertaft's [4] belief that the hand is indeed the "mirror of man's emotion" may be verified. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The characteristics of krill swarms in relation to aggregating Antarctic blue whales
PY  - 2019
AB  - We model the presence of rare Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) in relation to the swarm characteristics of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). A combination of visual observations and recent advances in passive acoustic technology were used to locate Antarctic blue whales, whilst simultaneously using active underwater acoustics to characterise the distribution, size, depth, composition and density of krill swarms. Krill swarm characteristics and blue whale presence were examined at a range of spatiotemporal scales to investigate sub meso-scale (i.e., <100 km) foraging behaviour. Results suggest that at all scales, Antarctic blue whales are more likely to be detected within the vicinity of krill swarms with a higher density of krill, those found shallower in the water column, and those of greater vertical height. These findings support hypotheses that as lunge-feeders of extreme size, Antarctic blue whales target shallow, dense krill swarms to maximise their energy intake. As both Antarctic krill and blue whales play a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the nature of their predator-prey dynamics is an important consideration, not only for the recovery of this endangered species in a changing environment, but for the future management of Antarctic krill fisheries. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - The chondrogenic potential of free autogenous periosteal grafts for biological resurfacing of major full-thickness defects in joint surfaces under the influence of continuous passive motion. An experimental investigation in the rabbit
PY  - 1986
AB  - A rectangular graft of autogenous tibial periosteum was sutured (with its cambium layer facing into the joint) onto the base of a five by ten-millimeter full-thickness defect in the patellar groove of each of 143 adolescent and adult rabbits. The rabbits were managed postoperatively by either immobilization, intermittent active motion, continuous passive motion for two weeks, or continuous passive motion for four weeks. When the animals were killed four weeks postoperatively, the contour of the patellar groove had been restored in all of the rabbits in the group that had had four weeks of continuous passive motion, and the newly formed tissue in all of the defects in this group had the gross, histological, and histochemical appearance of smooth, intact hyaline articular cartilage. Histologically, the nature of the tissue that had formed, as well as its surface regularity, structural integrity, and bonding to the adjacent cartilage, were significantly better in the group that had had four weeks of continuous passive motion than in any of the other groups. The results were significantly worse when the orientation of the periosteal graft was reversed (that is, when it had been sutured into the defect with the cambium layer of the graft facing the subchondral bone rather than into the joint) or when no periosteal graft was used. Biochemical analyses revealed that, in the group that had had four weeks of continuous passive motion, the total hexosamine content, the levels of chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate, and the ratio of galactosamine to glucosamine were all comparable with the values for normal articular cartilage. In contrast, in the groups that were treated by immobilization, intermittent active motion, or two weeks of continuous passive motion, as well as in the adult rabbits, the content of the first three of these substances was significantly less than normal. In the groups that were treated by immobilization, intermittent active motion, or two weeks of continuous passive motion, 32 to 47 per cent of the total collagen was type II, while the group that had had four weeks of continuous passive motion, 93 per cent of the total collagen was type II. These results demonstrate that, under the influence of continuous passive motion, free autogenous periosteal grafts can repair a large full-thickness defect in a joint surface by producing tissue that resembles articular cartilage grossly, histologically, and biochemically, and that contains predominantly type-II collagen.

TI  - The clinical and cultural factors in classifying low back pain patients within Greece: a qualitative exploration of Greek health professionals
PY  - 2007
AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives Identifying homogenous subgroups of low back pain (LBP) patients is considered a priority in musculoskeletal rehabilitation and is believed to enhance clinical outcomes. In order to achieve this, the specific features of each subgroup need to be identified. The aim of this study was to develop a list of clinical and cultural features that are included in the assessment of LBP patients in Greece, among health professionals. This 'list' will be, utilized in a clinical study for developing LBP subgroups.Methods Three focus groups were conducted, each one comprising health professionals with homogenous characteristics and all coordinated by a single moderator. There were: 11 physiotherapists (PTs) with clinical experience in LBP patients, seven PTs specialized in LBP management, and five doctors with a particular spinal interest. The focus of discussions was to develop a list of clinical and cultural features that were important in the examination of LBP. Content analysis was performed by two researchers.Results Clinicians and postgraduates developed five categories within the History (Present Symptoms, History of Symptoms, Function, Psychosocial, Medical History) and six categories within the Physical Examination (Observation, Neurological Examination, Active and Passive Movements, Muscle Features and Palpation). The doctors identified four categories in History (Symptomatology, Function, Psychosocial, Medical History) and an additional in Physical Examination (Special Tests). All groups identified three cultural categories; Attitudes of Health Professionals, Patients' Attitudes and Health System influences.Conclusion An extensive Greek 'list' of clinical and cultural features was developed from the groups' analysis. Although similarities existed in most categories, there were several differences across the three focus groups which will be discussed.

TI  - The coding of movement extent information
PY  - 1978
AB  - Previous work examining encoding of the extent of a standard movement has sought to explain why movement extent is more accurately encoded in preselected movements than in non-preselected movements. In the two experiments reported here the processes underlying preselection using whole arm movements were further examined. Experiment 1 suggested that improved encoding of movement extent in preselected movement involved the availability of information prior to the initiation of the to-be-remembered (standard) movement about the point of termination of the standard. Experiment 2 examined the role of active movement in preselection by comparing preselected and non-preselected movements in which the standard movement was made either actively (maximal efference) or passively (minimal efference). The results showed no active-passive difference in the preselected movements suggesting that movement-relevant information (e.g. efference) may not be a necessary component of preselection. These results were discussed as they pertain to the memorial representation of preselected movements.

TI  - The combination of virtual and reality on road design
PY  - 2013
AB  - With the rapid development of electronic information technology, computer technology, and space technology, the highway surveying technology and virtual scene in the design of the road become more and more important. The traditional road survey and design is mainly the flat-type design. The design made in this way is the two-dimensional one. Only by making the design to a road can we see the overall effect of the road design. The theoretical basis of the research will be found from the original road survey and the static graphic design will be made into a dynamic visual design by the use of model software. Through the concept of conversion, we can make the static design of the road into the dynamic design. By modeling the design and dynamically analyzing, we can analyze, improve and modify it when imitating the dynamic design. This is a modification of the virtual kind and can timely, accurately analyze the quality of the outcome of the study design. Therefore, the combination of virtuality and reality of the road design will become the mainstream trend.

TI  - The combined effects of continuous passive motion treatment and acellular PLGA implants on osteochondral regeneration in the rabbit
PY  - 2012
AB  - We investigated the active role of clinical rehabilitation in osteochondral regeneration using continuous passive motion (CPM) treatment together with acellular PLGA implants. CPM treatment was performed and compared with immobilization (Imm) treatment and intermittent active motion (IAM) treatment upon full-thickness osteochondral defects either with or without an PLGA implant in the PI (PLGA-implanted) and ED (empty defect) models. The PI and ED tests were performed in 38 rabbits for 4 and 12 weeks. At the end of testing, the PI-CPM group had the best regeneration with nearly normal articular surfaces and no joint contracture or inflammatory reaction. In contrast, degenerated joints, abrasion cartilage surfaces and synovitis were observed in the Imm and IAM groups. The achieved bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) ratio, which was measured using micro-CT, was significantly higher in the CPM group compared with the Imm and IAM groups; in particular, the performance of the PI-CPM group exceeds that of the ED-CPM group. The thickness of the trabecular (subchondral) bone was visibly increased in all of the groups from 4 through 12 weeks of testing. However, a histological analysis revealed differences in cartilage regeneration. At week 4, compared with the ED samples, all of the PI groups exhibited better collagen alignment and higher GAG content in the core of their repaired tissues, particularly in the PI-CPM group. At week 12, sound osteochondral repair and hyaline cartilaginous regeneration was observed in the PI-CPM group, and this was marked by type II collagen expression, osteocyte maturation, and trabecular boney deposition. In contrast, the PI-Imm and PI-IAM groups exhibited fibrocartilaginous tissues that had modest GAG content. In summary, this study demonstrates that early CPM treatment together with acellular PLGA implantation has significant positive effects on osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knee joint models.

TI  - The combined use of visual and acoustic data collection techniques for winter killer whale (Orcinus orca) observations
PY  - 2016
AB  - Observations of cetaceans during the winter are difficult, if not impossible in some locations, yet their presence, habitat use, and behaviour during this period are important for conservation and management. Typically, observations come from vessel surveys, with citizen science networks increasingly adding significant sighting data. In compliment to this, acoustic data collection systems can be deployed to collect information remotely over long periods, and in almost any conditions. Here we describe how the combination of these data collection techniques works to fill knowledge gaps, with data from a wellestablished citizen science network, and a single passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) recorder integrated to identify killer whale presence during winter months in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.Together these data show the overwinter use of Clayoquot Sound by killer whales is greater than previously thought. During the study period, February 21 to April 25, 2015, the citizen science network noted 14 visual encounters ranging from Amphitrite Point to Hot Spring Cove, Vancouver Island. The PAM recorded 17 acoustic encounters within the 10 km detection radius of the recorder, deployed off Siwash Point, Flores Island. This included 15 encounters not recorded by the visual network. Both resident and Bigg's (transient) transient whale groups were recorded, although analysis of vocalizations determined that the majority of the encounters recorded acoustically were of northern resident killer whales. This may be a function of life history, with Bigg's killer whales typically noted to be less acoustically active, or could represent greater site use by this group. This first use of acoustic monitoring over the winter, complemented with visual data, can establish a better understanding of year-round use of this area by killer whales and has broader application to other sites.

TI  - The compass elbow hinge: Indications and initial results
PY  - 2000
AB  - The Compass Elbow Hinge uses Illizarov's methods of fixation to externally hold the elbow reduced and allow both passive and active motion. Eleven patients with degenerative disease, contracture or instability were treated with the Compass Elbow Hinge and were retrospectively evaluated at an average follow-up of 29 months (range: 18-62 months). One was lost to follow-up. Patients with degenerative changes underwent fascia lata interposition while those treated for contractures underwent anterior and posterior capsular release with or without fascia lata interposition. Those with elbow instability underwent ligament reconstruction. The device was removed after 6 weeks and seven of the 11 patients were satisfied with the outcome of the operation. Stability could not be achieved in two patients with coronoid fractures that were not reconstructed. One patient did not tolerate the device and requested its removal with subsequent subluxation. We conclude that patient selection and compliance are key elements in achieving a satisfactory outcome with the device.

TI  - The components of shoulder and elbow movements as goals of primary reconstructive operation in obstetric brachial plexus lesions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Most of the cases of obstetric brachial plexus lesions (OBPL) show satisfactory improvement with conservative management, but in about 25% some surgical treatment is indicated. The present paper analyzes the effects of primary reconstructive surgeries in aspect of achieving delineated intraoperatively goals.Children operated before the age of 18 months with follow-up period longer than 1 year were selected. Therapeutic goals established during the operation were identified by analysis of initial clinical status and operative protocols. The elementary movement components in shoulder and elbow joints were classified by assessing range of motion, score in Active Movement Scale and modified British Medical Research Council scale of muscle strength. The effect was considered satisfactory when some antigravity movement was possible, and good when strength exceeded M3 or antigravity movement exceeded half of range of passive movement.In 13 of 19 patients most of established goals were achieved at good level, in 2 at satisfactory level. Remaining 4 patients showed improvement only in some aspects of extremity function. In 2 patients improvement in some movements was accompanied by worsening of other movements.The analysis of results separated into individual components of movements showed that goals were achieved in most of the cases, simultaneously clearly indicating which damaged structures failed to provide satisfactory function despite being addressed intraoperatively.The good results were obtained mainly by regeneration through grafts implanted after resection of neuroma in continuity, which proves that this technique is safe in spite of unavoidable temporary regression of function postoperatively.

TI  - The connection between Kim Soo-young's "The Philosophy of Noise" and "Love"  How noise becomes love
PY  - 2018
AB  - This For Kim Soo-young, loud noise was a challenge to everyday life and an inevitable condition of life and writing. The noise of war and prison camps, the incessant noise of the city, the noise of power and capital, the noise of the house, and the noise of nature have a direct and lasting effect on Kim's life and literature. Noise becomes the paradoxical energy that effectively engages Kim's creative process, is used as the core sanctions and methods of writing, and evoke 'love' as the basis for his sense of connection with other players and the world. The noise of the modern world is an important opportunity for Kim to discover and amplify "Love," which often appears throughout his literature as the original sound of "The Variations of Love." For Kim, literary activity is the ethical and aesthetic work of the world's transformation of violent and delicate "noise" into "love." Listening to 'noise' as 'love' imitates "enactment of enemy" ("modern bridge") and "a great city of love" with the discovery of the future of love through the nature of things. In this process, Kim's listening attitude and style change. From the beginning to the latter, Kim will move from passive to active listening, from repressive to productive listening, from critical and hostile self-centered to open-minded and communal listening.In short, if Kim Soo-young's "viewing" mainly intervenes in the ethics of self-consciousness, reflection, criticism, conscience and freedom, "listening" is mainly about batters, anger, hatred, But just as the ethics of subject-being and the other-being cannot be separated, viewing and listening in Kim Soo-young's literature must create a different path and method, and balance the existing discussion of visual/visuality. This article takes the view that 'sound/listening' has played a great role in the creation and movement of love, and takes a look at the background and meaning of his "noise philosophy" that he has developed by adopting the words.

TI  - The contribution of active body movement to visual development in evolutionary robots
PY  - 2005
AB  - Inspired by the pioneering work by Held and Hein (1963) on the development of kitten visuo-motor systems, we explore the role of active body movement in the developmental process of the visual system by using robots. The receptive fields in an evolved mobile robot are developed during active or passive movement with a Hebbian learning rule. In accordance to experimental observations in kittens, we show that the receptive fields and behavior of the robot developed under active condition significantly differ from those developed under passive condition. A possible explanation of this difference is derived by correlating receptive field formation and behavioral performance in the two conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - "The Pains of Sleep," an agonizing poem written in 1803, describes nights of "fiendish dream," and "the unfathomable hell within" Coleridge pictures the will caught in a kind of cleft, "burning" to do the right thing, but "still baffled": "To know and loathe, yet wish and do!" A year later, on the Malta voyage, he confided to his notebook that he feared sleep as "a pandemonium of all the shames and miseries of the past life from earliest childhood all huddled together." Sterne had made this clear enough in Tristram Shandy, a novel deeply admired by Coleridge. [...]it is that Coleridge alights on his lovely image of the self winning its way against a counterflow, as a water-insect "wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a momentary fulcrum for a further propulsion. Coleridge had a deep sense of his sinfulness, a nature "deepliest stained with sin," as he puts it one poem, and a firm belief in original sin. [...]he writes, again in perfect orthodoxy, "To conquer ourselves is the only true knowledge." [...]in one notebook entry, he characterizes poetry as "a rationalized dream."

TI  - The correspondence between structural and statistical features of percepts differing in degree of constancy
PY  - 1971
AB  - Studied form percepts by presenting 8- and 10-sided figures, one component at a time, using a film projector whose projection speed increased from 8-150 frames/sec in the course of exposure of a single figure. Ss' drawings of the figures were rated and grouped in 5 categories depending on the degree of resemblance to the originals. It was found that these categories correspond to the 5 stages in the emergence of a form percept as the luminance of the form is increased from subthreshold levels. Analogous results were obtained in an earlier experiment on the tactual recognition of form in which information was supplied by changing from passive to active tactile exploration of the form. Results are discussed in information-theoretical terms, and an attempt is made to subsume the empirical results under the general theory of statistical and structural organization of signals.

TI  - The cortical spatiotemporal correlate of otolith stimulation: Vestibular evoked potentials by body translations
PY  - 2017
AB  - The vestibular organ senses linear and rotational acceleration of the head during active and passive motion. These signals are necessary for bipedal locomotion, navigation, the coordination of eye and head movements in 3D space. The temporal dynamics of vestibular processing in cortical structures have hardly been studied in humans, let alone with natural stimulation.The aim was to investigate the cortical vestibular network related to natural otolith stimulation using a hexapod motion platform. We conducted two experiments, 1. to estimate the sources of the vestibular evoked potentials (VestEPs) by means of distributed source localization (n=49), and 2. to reveal modulations of the VestEPs through the underlying acceleration intensity (n=24). For both experiments subjects were accelerated along the main axis (left/right, up/down, fore/aft) while the EEG was recorded.We were able to identify five VestEPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) with latencies between 38 and 461 ms as well as an evoked beta-band response peaking with a latency of 68 ms in all subjects and for all acceleration directions. Source localization gave the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the opercular-insular region as the main origin of the evoked potentials. No lateralization effects due to handedness could be observed. In the second experiment, area CSv was shown to be integral in the processing of acceleration intensities as sensed by the otolith organs, hinting at its potential role in ego-motion detection. These robust VestEPs could be used to investigate the mechanisms of inter-regional interaction in the natural context of vestibular processing and multisensory integration.

TI  - The course of pain and passive motion after shoulder surgery—a descriptive analysis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder. The reported annual incidence of shoulder pain in primary care is 14.7 per 1000 patients per year. After shoulder surgery subsequent physiotherapy treatment is essential for successful recovery. One of the most frequent complications is a postoperative adhesive capsulitis. Possible causes might be prolonged pain, insufficient exercise of the shoulder or too aggressive physiotherapy. Knowing the course of pain and passive range of motion (ROM) after shoulder surgeries may help physiotherapists to improve patient management during rehabilitation in order to avoid adhesive capsulitis. Purpose: Goal of this study was to investigate the course of pain and passive ROM in patients after three types of shoulder surgery. Methods: For this cohort study patients undergoing shoulder surgery at University Hospital were identified and analysed retrospectively. All data was collected by three experienced physiotherapists between 2005 and 2011 during follow up visits. Passive glenohumeral ROM and maximum pain on a visual analog scale (0-10) were measured at discharge from hospital, then after two, four and six weeks, as well as at three and six months after surgery. Data could be retrieved from the protocols of 246 patients (prosthesis n = 60, rotator cuff refixation n = 149, ostheosynthesis after humeral head fractures n = 37). Differences between the groups at every time point were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey-Test, at a level of significance of p<0.05. Results: Maximum pain decreased and passive ROM improved over time. Maximum pain in the first weeks was mainly between 1 and 2 in all groups. Concerning external rotation the prosthesis group reached at six months 22degree (sd 18.2degree), the rotator cuff group 38degree (sd 15.7degree) and the fracture group 29degree (sd 15.9degree). Over all time points the rotator cuff group had significant better external rotation than the prosthesis group (all p < 0.001). The rotator cuff group had also significant better elevation after six months with 142degree (sd 13.5degree) and therefore a difference of 12degree to the healthy side (both p < 0.001). The prosthesis group reached 120degree (sd 25.7degree) elevation and 26degree less than the average of the healthy side, and the fracture group showed 121degree (sd 17.9degree) with a difference of about 33degree. Conclusion(s): In all groups maximum pain was fairly low. Patients after rotator cuff surgery showed better passive ROM than patients with a prosthesis or osteosynthesis, but they had slightly more pain during rehabilitation. The improvement of mobility was seen through the whole six months after surgery. Good passive glenohumeral mobility builds the foundation for active motion and therefore function and activities of daily living. Implications: The existing data for the normal regain of mobility after different shoulder surgeries will provide guidance for physiotherapists, in order to judge the success of rehabilitation. Pain reduction may not be so important as regain of mobility. Additionally, postoperative adhesive capsulitis might be detected at an early stage. However, further prospective studies with more data and longer follow up are needed to investigate the passive and active course of ROM after shoulder surgery.

TI  - The dance form of the eyes: What cognitive science can learn from art
PY  - 1999
AB  - Art perception offers action affordances for the self-generated movement of the eyes, the mind, and the emotions; thus some scenes are 'easy to look at', and evoke different kinds of moods depending on what kind of affordances they present for the eyes, the brain, and the action schemas that further the dynamical self-organizing patterns of activity toward which the organism tends, as reflected in its ongoing emotional life. Art can do this only because perception is active rather than passive, and begins with efferent activity in emotional brain areas (e.g. hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and anterior cingulate) which then motivates afferent processing (parietal imaging activity which finally, after a 1/3-second motivational/selective process is complete, resonates with occipital patterns, resulting in perceptual consciousness). The limbic system 'categories' that motivate the 'looking-for' of selective attention are categories of utility, to be understood in terms of emotional affordances and whole-organism affective meanings. Art plays with this looking-for, using it to make us engage in different afforded actions that relate to different limbic (emotional) categories. The drawings of children and of the artistically untutored reveal this structure when we fail to 'draw what we see', drawing, instead what we conceptualize that we ought to be seeing. Art teaches us to get beyond this almost complete dominance of habitual categories, and to see things more freshly - both in the perceptual and in the emotive sphere. Rather than reinforcing our preconceptions, it forces us to see how they affect our view of reality. Because neither perceptions nor emotional responses are really passive 'responses' at all, art does not cause us to feel a certain way. Instead, we 'use' art for the purpose of symbolizing our emotions. Our most important feelings are not directly 'about' the perceptual objects that trigger them. The object in conscious attention during the feeling of an emotion is normally not the intentional object of the emotion, i.e., it is not the object in relation to which our actions could serve the purpose of the emotion. Emotions are not even triggered by simple 'stimuli', but rather by the meaning for us of a stimulus in a total context determined by ongoing and dynamical organismic purposes. Emotions arise from the total life process, which is a dynamical system - not as an isolated chemical event or a causal result of a simple stimulus. For this reason, emotions call not just for satiation or pleasure, but for explication; this is why art is different from entertainment or pretty decoration. Visual art affords not only a meaningful, self-directed dance of the eyes, but also a meaningful dance of this emotional explicating process.

TI  - The design and calibration of low cost urban acoustic sensing devices
PY  - 2020
AB  - The urban sound environment of New York City (NYC) can be, amongst other things: loud, intrusive, exciting and dynamic. As indicated by the large majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information/complaints line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on the quality of life of the city's inhabitants. To monitor and ultimately understand these sonic environments, a process of long-term acoustic measurement and analysis is required. The traditional method of environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes short term measurement periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by experienced and costly personnel. The proposed project takes a different approach to this application by implementing smart, low-cost, static, acoustic sensing devices based around consumer hardware. These devices can be deployed in numerous and varied urban locations for long periods of time, allowing for the collection of longitudinal urban acoustic data. The varied environmental conditions of New York City make for a challenge in gathering calibrated sound pressure level data for prospective stakeholders. The wide variations in temperature and humidity affect microphone sensitivity and response, which can increase the likelihood of the generation of erroneous sound pressure level readings. This paper details the sensors' design, development and potential future applications, with a focus on the calibration of the devices' Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone in order to generate reliable decibel levels at the type/class 2 level.

TI  - The detection of human finger movement is not facilitated by input from receptors in adjacent digits
PY  - 2003
AB  - These experiments were designed to determine whether cutaneous input from a digit provides a general facilitation of the detection of movements applied to an adjacent digit. The ability to detect passive movements at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger was measured when cutaneous (and joint) input was removed (using local anaesthesia) from the tip of one or both digits adjacent to the test finger (16 subjects). The same parameter was also measured when input was artificially increased by stimulation of the adjacent digits at three intensities: below, above and at perceptual threshold (PT; 15 subjects). Detection of flexion or extension movements was not altered by anaesthesia of one or both adjacent digits. Since it was possible that too few tonically active afferents in the hand had been blocked to reveal an effect, the median nerve was blocked, with movements applied to the little finger, causing no measurable impairment in acuity (three subjects). Simultaneous electrical stimulation of the tips of the adjacent digits at intensities above PT impaired movement detection, but had no effect when delivered at or below PT. To test whether the effect of detectable electrical stimuli was due to a specific interaction between the artificial input and the input evoked by moving the digit, or due to mental distraction, stimuli were delivered above PT to either the left or right little finger, or the test index finger during movement of the index finger. Electrical stimulation of the index finger significantly reduced detection by similar to50 %, but stimulation of the remote little fingers did not. Electrical stimulation is a non-natural stimulus, so a 'natural' stimulus was applied by continuously stroking the tips of the adjacent digits with a brush (10 subjects). The natural stimulus also significantly reduced movement detection by similar to50%. Together, these findings suggest that tonic inputs from digital nerve afferents adjacent to, or more remote from the passively moved finger do not facilitate movement detection. However, the reduced detection during stimulation of the adjacent digits shows that there is nevertheless some interaction between the various proprioceptive inputs from the digits.

TI  - The determination of object type and position using high speed vision
PY  - 1985
AB  - In this paper we describe a robot vision system for the fast determination of object type and location. The algorithms are general and powerful enough to be used both in passive and active vision applications. Here, their practical implementation in a passive robot vision system is discussed. A solid state array camera takes images of the objects passing underneath. Local characteristic features are extracted from contours in a binary image and yield the basis for object recognition. © 1985 SPIE.

TI  - The development of a technique for the morphometric analysis of invasion in cancer
PY  - 1984
AB  - We describe tests of the feasibility of a reconstructive technique to discriminate between expansive growth and active cell movement in the invasion of tissues by cancer cells. The densities of cancer cells in 2210 μm2 (grid) squares of standard 6 μm fixed, stained histologic sections of a nodule and an invasive cutaneous melanoma were determined, and density maps of the tumors constructed. An abrupt transition from saturation density to zero cell density was observed at the advancing edge (towards the stratum corneum) of the tumor nodule which was consistent with a model for expansion by growth (vis a tergo). In contrast, at the advancing edge of the invasive tumor, the transition from saturation to zero density (towards the subcutaneous tissues) occurred more gradually, over approximately 400 μm, which was consistent with a model for invasion by active movement of melanoma cells. The occurrence of statistically significant "high density regions" near to the advancing edge of the invasive tumor is consistent with an invasive pattern of active movement followed by focal proliferation of the cancer cells, in a repetitious manner. It therefore appears feasible to make kinetic reconstructions of some of the events in invasion, from static quantitative observations. © 1984 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.

PY  - 2001
AB  - To develop the ZMS-1 3-D motion and stiffness of the cervical spine measuring equipment. Methods: A device that measures the three-dimensional motion and stiffness of the cervical spine in vivo was designed according to 3-dimensional 6-degree of freedom motion principle of spine. The biomechanics of cervical spine in vivo were investigated in 20 volunteer students. The reliability of measuring data was tested. Results: The measuring equipment is consisted of three-dimensional movable frame, torque sensor, resistance strain gauge, head-device, chair with vest and base. The functionality includes the measurement of the ROM of cervical spine, the stiffness of neck and the power of cervical muscle group. The correlation test on the two data sets of active and passive range of motion, peak torque of passive motion, peak torque of isometric contract of cervical extensors and flexors and load-displacement curve shows that the data has good reliability. Conclusion: The equipment provide an effective means for evaluating the three-dimensional motion and stiffness of human neck in vivo.

TI  - The discharges during movement of cells in the ventrolateral thalamus of the conscious monkey.
PY  - 1980
AB  - 1. Monkeys were trained to perform a stereotyped movement task in return for food rewards. On completion of training a headpiece which allowed microelectrode access to the thalamus for single cell recordings during performances of the task was attached at a surgical operation. The location of each cell studied was determined by histological examination of the fixed brain and precise identification of electrode tracks. 2. Ninety‐three of ninety‐seven cells discharging in association with arm movements but not responding to natural activation of peripheral receptors in the forelimb were located predominantly in the rostral part of nucleus VPLo and the caudo‐ventral part of VLo. These cells appeared to be associated with active movement in one direction of a specific joint. 3. 52% of these ‘motor’ cells discharged in association with movements of either forelimb. The other 48% discharged in association with movement of the contralateral arm and hand only. 4. Sixty cells responded to stimulation of deep receptors or to passive limb manipulation in the relaxed and cooperative animal. These cells were predominantly located in the ventro‐caudal part of VPLo and all the responses were obtained from contralateral receptors. Their discharges during performances of the motor task were indistinguishable from those of ‘motor’ cells. 5. Ninety‐two cells were driven by limb manipulation and by natural activation of superficial cutaneous receptors and these were found predominantly in VPLo and VPLc. All responses were from contralateral receptors. These cells discharged during performance of the motor task; for some of them, their afferent input zones were not being stimulated by contact with the manipulandum when their ‘motor’ discharges commenced. 6. Although responses in each of the above groups of cells were sought by imposing a sudden perturbation of the limb during the performance of the active movement task, no responses were seen. © 1980 The Physiological Society

TI  - The dynamic behaviour of valve reeds in reciprocating gas compressors - analytical study.
PY  - 1980
AB  - Aspects of the static and dynamic behaviour of valve reeds were considered. Initially static deformation and stress in a cantilever suction valve reed were calculated using the finite element method. The free vibration of a cantilever reed was derived using the same method. The computer program used, DRST4, was examined in relation to convergence of solution. The results were compared with those obtained by other methods and with experimental values obtained by laser holography. The finite element method was then applied to predict the dynamic motion and stress patterns in a cantilever suction valve reed in response to the pressure-time history in a compressor during the suction phase of the cycle. Another program, RESP95ST, was used in conjunction with DRST4. The predicted values under dynamic conditions appeared to be reasonable and logical: predicted displacements are compared with experimental values in a sequential paper. (A)

PY  - 2010
AB  - In this paper, lead-free Na0.5K0.5NbO3 (NKN) based piezoelectric ceramics are synthesized by the conventional mixed-oxide methods with sintering temperature at 900-1050 °C. Microstructural analyses of un-doped and CuO-doped ceramics have been carried out and compared using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), The dependence of the sintering temperatures of the CuO-doped NKN ceramics on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been investigated. The results show that the CuO-doped NKN specimens sintered at 1020 °C present the high thickness coupling factor, kt (>0.50), mechanical quality factor Qm =1100 and the lower temperature coefficient of resonance frequency in thickness mode (dfr/fr <2%) within the temperature range 20-100 °C Then, we successfully construct 3-MHz transducers (LF transducer) utilizing our fabricated piezoceramics and examine their static resonant characteristics. Simultaneously, their dynamic acoustic power is measured by the acoustic force balance under a power circuit driving with the intermittent pulse control as compared to the commercial transducers. We find the effective coupling factor of LF transducer (0.05) is superior to that of commercial transducer (0.45).

TI  - The dynamic expansion and contraction of the Jovian plasma sheet
PY  - 1980
AB  - Observations suggesting the sequential expansion and compression of the Jovian plasma sheet are reported. Plasma flow in the vicinity of Jupiter was monitored by the four modulated-grid Faraday cups on board each of the Voyager spacecraft at times of closest Jupiter approach. Sensor measurements reveal the flow of magnetospheric plasma to be directed away from the equatorial current sheet near local noon and to be directed towards the sheet in the dusk to midnight sector. The observed flow patterns are interpreted in terms of short-time-scale perturbations of magnetic flux tubes due to the compression of the dayside magnetosphere by the solar wind. It is noted that such a dynamic motion is quite different from what would be expected of slower, quasi-static equilibrium plasma sheet expansion and contraction.

TI  - The dynamic interplay between active and passive knee stability: Implications for management of the high ACL injury risk athlete
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common problem affecting athletes. Individuals with certain active (movement, training, and growth) and passive (genetics, hormones, anatomy) factors are at increased risk of injury. There is dynamic interplay between the active and passive factors that is directly attributable to an increased risk for ACL injury. Oftentimes, those individuals with both passive and active factors are at the highest risk for ACL injury. Identifying these individuals and providing additional training (i.e., neuromuscular training) have the best potential to mitigate the injury risk.

TI  - The dynamic quantitation of spasticity with automated integrals of passive motion resistance
PY  - 1964
AB  - A method is described for quantitating spasticity in the forearm or lower leg. The limb is carried through passive, linear motion at varying angular velocities. At high velocities forceful spasms develop opposing the direction of rotation. The degree of muscular reaction is plotted as torques with characteristic amplitudes and time durations, and the torque magnitude integrated into a meaningful work measurement. Spasticity is defined as the work output in response to angular velocity input per 100 degree cycle (back and forth), of passive motion. A spasticity index obtained from the total work value at varying velocities may be used as a measure o f drug response, and is reportable' in fundamental physical units. A wide range of antispastie agents has been tested and many have proved effective for short periods when administered intravenously. Diazepam, given orally in one case, effectively reduced spasticity for 5 weeks. © 1964.

TI  - The effect and timing of physiotherapy on change in range of motion and function in frozen shoulder
PY  - 2000
AB  - Purpose. Frozen shoulder is defined as the presence of a soft tissue capsular lesion accompanied by painful and restricted active and passive motion at the glenohumeral joint. As patients are referred to physiotherapists at different times from the onset of frozen shoulder, the aim of this study was to determine whether physiotherapy would have different effect on the range of movement for patients who start physiotherapy at different time onset of frozen shoulder. Method. Range of movement (flexion, abduction, lateral rotation and hand behind back combined movement) and function for the affected shoulder joint were recorded from 35 patients over two months of physiotherapy. These patients were at different stages of the condition ranging two months to one year from the initial onset. They were categorized into four groups according to the time (0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 months) since onset of frozen shoulder. Result. From the collected data, the patient group that started therapy within 3 months of onset demonstrated the greatest improvement in the range of movement for all directions studied. However, only the improvement in the range of flexion was statistically significant (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). The improvements in range of movement for abduction, lateral rotation and hand behind back combined movement; and function were not statistically significant between the four groups of subjects. Discussion and Conclusion. The findings indicated that patients with frozen shoulder improved with physiotherapy regardless of the time from onset of frozen shoulder and they will achieve greater improvement in their range of movement when treatment was administered earlier. This study suggested that efforts should be made to improve the awareness of frozen shoulder so that treatment would be sought as soon as possible to prevent delay in recovery.

TI  - The effect of SNAGs at L4/5 on the range of flexion compared to repeated flexion, assessed via three independent measures
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose: 2.6 million people in the UK seek advice from their GP every year for lower back pain (LBP), one key symptom is loss of range of movement which is associated with functional loss. Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides (SNAGs) are derived from Mulligan's Mobilisations with Movements and target the motion segment at one spinal level. By applying a central passive accessory glide combined with an active movement, it is thought that the mechanics of a SNAG increases active range of movement. Contrastingly, auto-mobilisations are also a treatment technique and involve completing a Repeated Auto-Flexion (RA-F) movement which may also provide an increased range of movement. However, it is unclear whether SNAGs are effective due to the glide applied or the accompanying movement into flexion. This study investigated the effect of repeated SNAGs applied to L4/L5 for increasing lumbar spine flexion, in comparison to RA-F, assessed via three independent measures. Methods: A within-subject crossover design was implemented using a convenience sample of 26 health participants, (Mean age 20.12 years, Range 18–25). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied based on the intervention of SNAGS and Repeated Auto-Flexions. Condition A was repeated lumbar L4/5 SNAGs and Condition B was RA-F. Measurements were taken after each condition and the participants’ results were compared. Three recognised lumbar spine range of movement outcome measures were used: Fingertip to Floor (FTF), Double Inclinometer (DI) and the Modified-Modified Schober's test (MMS). Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Ethical approval was obtained from Cardiff University, School of Healthcare Science Ethics Board prior to data collection. Results: FTF values were calculated using a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and demonstrated no statistically significant difference between SNAGS and RA-F, p = 0.274. DI values were calculated using a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and demonstrated no statistically significant difference between SNAGS and RA-F, p = 0.722. MMS test values were calculated using a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and demonstrated no statistically significant difference between SNAGS and RA-F, p = 0.777. All three measures demonstrated no significant difference. Conclusion(s): There was no statistical difference between SNAGS and RA-F on range of movement, measured independently with a FTF test, DI and the MMS test. These results suggest that SNAGS are no more effective than RA-F on Lumbar Spine Range of Movement. However it should be noted that conducting this research on healthy subjects presents a limitation when applying it to the physiotherapy treatment of reduced lumbar ROM in patients with LBP and the change in range was not measured within condition. Future research should aim to incorporate a change of range measure as well as reproducing this study on pathological subjects. Implications: Both treatment options have theoretical justification but evidence has previously lacked to compare their effects. It is important to establish the difference in outcomes between these two treatments to provide justification for their clinical use. Therefore, research into this area is clinically relevant. However, the findings of this study are not generaliable to the wider LBP population due sample used.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to find the effect of triceps brachii vibration on proprioception, during motor performance of elbow joint. 150 healthy young participants within the age group of 18-26 years were selected. To confirm that the method of vibration alters proprioceptive sensation, testing the limb position matching during both passive and active movements, without and with vibration was carried out. Vibration was applied directly over the triceps brachii tendon and visual feedback was restricted for all participants. Ranges of motion for both elbow joints were documented. The data obtained was analyzed statistically and results were displayed graphically. During the vibration trials, a significant difference was found in the scores obtained by the matching limb, in the passive driven condition and active matching condition. This finding confirms that a vibratory stimulus applied to the triceps brachii, during elbow …

TI  - The effect of a clitoral and vaginal vibratory device on female sexual dysfunction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Introduction: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a common problem that affects up to 55 % of women 18-65 years with 33-67% of these women reporting sexual-related distress (1). Despite this, few treatment options exist. Limited research suggests that neurological integrity plays a critical role in preserving sexual arousal and orgasm in females and reduction in genital sensation is associated with FSD. The Eroscillator (Advanced Response Corp, New York, NY) is a specially designed oscillating vibrator that allows for direct stimulation of the clitoral shaft, the mons, and vagina. We hypothesized that by enhancing the intensity of stimulation provided during sexual activity in women with FSD, the Eroscillator would improve arousal and orgasm that results from decreased genital sensation. Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Eroscillator in improving sexual arousal and orgasm in women with FSD. The secondary outcomes were to determine if the Eroscillator increases genital sensation and to evaluate the effects of the Eroscillator on sexual satisfaction and sexual-related distress. Methods: From January 2009 to August 2013, we conducted a prospective, cohort study of English-speaking women≥ 21 years old from Connecticut and New York, who reported a lack of sexual arousal or failure to achieve orgasm in more than 70 % of their sexual encounters. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, absence of sexual activity in the last month, known HIV, active vulvar or pelvic pathology, advanced prolapse or prior prolapse surgery, neurological disorders, insulin-dependent diabetes, use of antidepressants or antipsychotic medications, or substance abuse. Demographic data were obtained. Sexual function, sexually-related distress and subjective effects from the vibrator were evaluated using the validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) and the Female Intervention Efficacy Index (FIEI) questionnaires at baseline and 1 and 3- month follow-ups. Genital nerve sensation was evaluated along five sites in the genital region (clitoris, bilateral labia and bilateral perineum) with the Medoc 3000 vibratory sensory analyzer (Biomedical Instrument Company, Newbury OH) with a stimulus frequency fixed at 120Hz signal. The method of limits was used to distinguish between vibration and static touch. Weekly diaries were completed after initiating Eroscillator use to assess frequency of instrument use. Generalized Estimation Equations and mixed-effects models with pairwise subgroup contrasts were performed to determine the significance of Eroscillator use on trends over time for FSD and neurological function from baseline to 1 and 3 months. Results: Seventy-eight women were eligible for participation. The mean age was 36.6+13.0 years. Ninety percent of women were heterosexual; the remainder were bisexual. The percentage of women who self-classified themselves as White, Black and Hispanic were 39.7, 46.2 and 14.1 %, respectively. The frequency of vibrator use decreased significantly over time, with median use 3 times/week (range 0-9) at week 1, and 2 times/week (range 0-5) at week 12 (p=.0007). FSFI assessments of sexual arousal and orgasm were both significantly improved at 1 and 3-months compared to baseline (p<0.0001 for both outcomes). FSFI scores also demonstrated significant improvements in sexual desire, sexual satisfaction and total FSD at 1 and 3-months compared to baseline (p<0.0001 for all outcomes). Differences between 1 and 3-months were not significant for any of these parameters. Mean total FSFI scores improved from 19.8+4.4 at baseline to 25.1+4.8 at 1-month and 26.5+5.5 at 3-months (both p<.0001). FSDS scores reflected significantly decreased distress at 1 and 3-months compared to baseline (p =0.0004, <0.0001, respectively) and at 3-months compared to 1- month (p=0.02). Neurological sensation was also increased at all 5 sites at 1 month with sustained improvements at 3- months (p<.0001). FIEI perceptions of increased vaginal lubrication, genital sensation and orgasm were noted in 62.5, 66.7 and 54.6 % of women at 1- month, and in 65.8, 81.6 and 63.2 % at 3-months. No major adverse events were noted by any women Conclusions: Use of the Eroscillator resulted in uniform subjective improvements in sexual arousal, orgasm and desire as well as sexual satisfaction and sexually-related distress; it also resulted in objective improvements in genital sensation. Our data suggest a plausible mechanism by which this specially designed vibrator can enhance sexual function in women through direct or indirect modulation of the nervous system. The Eroscillator could potentially offer a safe therapeutic strategy for improving sexual health and quality of life in women with sexual dysfunction.

TI  - The effect of a prior quadriceps contraction on knee flexor torque in normal subjects and multiple sclerosis patients with spastic paraparesis
PY  - 1987
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of a prior quadriceps contraction on knee flexor torque in normal subjects and multiple sclerosis patients. Twelve subjects (10 females, two males, mean age 34.8 years) with spastic paraparesis secondary to multiple sclerosis and 12 healthy adults, matched by age and sex, with no history of knee pathology participated in this study. A Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer and chart recorder were used to measure the torque and angle of peak torque produced during knee flexion at 30, 90 and 180°s. The subjects performed two tests of knee flexion. In test one, the subjects maximally flexed their knee three times from a passively extended position. During the second test, the subjects maximally extended and then flexed their knee three times. The tests were randomly ordered and both lower extremities were tested. The subject's limbs were also passively dropped from an extended position at three preselected velocities (30, 90, 180°s). The Cybex goniograms which were produced during passive and active movement were compared. The results of this study show that in subjects with spastic paraparesis secondary to multiple sclerosis, contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle is a primary impediment to the development of knee flexor torque. In addition, the patients produce low torque, and restraint to active movement is greater than restraint to passive movement. © 1987 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - The effect of active loading on translation of the humeral head during glenohumeral abduction
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effect of passive and active muscle loading on humeral head translation during glenohumeral abduction. A shoulder simulator produced unconstrained active glenohumeral abduction using several sets of loading ratios. Significantly greater translations occurred in passive motion as compared to active motion between 30 and 70 degrees of elevation in three dimensions and in the anterosuperior plane. No difference was found between the active motions. Also, translations of the humeral head decreased with active simulation of abduction emphasizing the importance of the rotator cuff muscles in creating and maintaining the ball-and-socket kinematics of the shoulder. This in-vitro study was conducted to determine the effect of passive and active loading on humeral head translation during glenohumeral abduction. Five cadaveric shoulders were tested using a shoulder simulator designed to produce unconstrained abduction of the humerus. Forces were applied to simulate loading of the supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus/teres minor, anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid muscles using four different sets of loading ratios. These were based on: equal loads to all cables (Constant-Constant); average physiological cross-sectional areas (pCSAs) of the muscles (pCSA); constant (Constant EMG), and variable (Variable EMG) values of the product of electromyographic data and pCSAs. In three dimensions, significantly greater translations occurred in passive motion as compared to active motion between 30 and 70 degrees of elevation (p<0.001). No difference was found between the active motions. Similar results were observed in the two-dimensional resultant translations in the anterosuperior plane of the scapula, with more translation occurring during passive motion (3.6 {+/-} 1.1mm) than active (2.1 {+/-} 1.0mm) (p=0.002), and no significant differences between the active loading methods (Figure 1). The majority of translation tended to occur in the superior-inferior direction for all loading ratios employed. It was clearly shown that the translations of the humeral head decreased with active simulation of abduction. These findings are in agreement with other in-vivo and in-vitro investigations. This emphasizes the importance of the rotator cuff muscles in creating and maintaining the ball-and-socket kinematics of the shoulder.

TI  - The effect of active movement and passive monitoring of the same movement on electric brain activity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Introduction: Mirror neurons are specific association neurons that are active both during a certain movement and during the observation of such movement. It can be assumed that mirror neurons play an important role in the ability to imitate and are an important condition for the rehabilitation of the locomotor system. Methods: The aim of our work was to find out whether and how the electrical brain activity is evaluated using the sLORETA display between the actual active movement of a particular motion and the passive tracking of the same motion performed by the therapist or the same motion in the 2D video monitored in the virtual environment. Results: The study was attended by 12 healthy, college students, 8 women and 4 men, whose average age was 24 years. Electroencephalographic activity was registered using the Natus Neurology Nicolet EEG Wireless 32/64 Amplifier, a 32-channel telemetric EEG device. (USA). Statistically significant differences in the significance level of p≤0.05 were found in the alpha-1, 2 and beta-2 band when comparing active movement (ACTIVE) versus resting EEG (PRE OE), passive motion monitoring by the therapist PASSIVE versus resting EEG activity with open eyes (PRE OE) and passive 2D motion video viewing (VIDEO) versus resting EEG open-eye activity (PRE OE). Conclusion: The results show that there is a great similarity in brain activity in monitoring the movement of the therapist and in the actual implementation of the same movement by the patient. This finding completely corresponds to the existence of mirror neurons and the results of published studies. The second finding is the finding of a difference in brain activity between real--world motion tracking and tracking the same motion in 2D video in virtual reality glasses.

TI  - The effect of active versus passive exploration on memory for spatial location in children.
PY  - 1979
AB  - The effect of active exploration upon memory for spatial location of an event was assessed for children at 2 age levels. Each child took a walk through the same unfamiliar hallway in search of a hidden object which he was later asked to relocate. Half the children were accompanied by an adult holding their hand (passive condition), while the other half proceeded on their own with an adult following behind (active condition). An age x condition interaction revealed that active exploration significantly improved performance of the 3- and 4-year-old group while not affecting the performance of the 9- and 10-year-olds. The 3- and 4-year-olds in the active condition, however, were still significantly less accurate than the older children, despite their experience of self-directed exploration. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that self-directed activity serves to increase attention of preoperational children to relevant topological cues in the environment, whereas concrete operational children, due to their knowledge of projective and Euclidean space, demonstrate increased capacity to efficiently encode spatial information regardless of the mode of exploration.

TI  - The effect of age and gender on normal temporomandibular joint movement
PY  - 1991
AB  - The active physiological and passive accessory movements of the paired temporomandibular joints (TMJ) of 100 asymptomatic subjects were evaluated. Values were obtained for the active movements of both a young and an old population of asymptomatic males and females. Increasing age significantly affected the range and quality of the movements assessed. Mandibular depression and right lateral deviation were the only movements found to be significantly different between the males and females. The males recorded larger ranges than the females. The results of this study indicate that certain changes associated with increasing age in other synovial joints of the body also occur in the TMJ and that assessment results of the symptomatic TMJ should be compared to the normative data of subjects of the same gender and age. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - The effect of anti-pronation foot orthoses on hip and knee kinematics and muscle activity during a functional step-up task in healthy individuals: A laboratory study
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Greater frontal and transverse plane hip and knee motion, and delayed gluteus medius and vastus medialis oblique activation have frequently been identified in patellofemoral pain syndrome populations, whilst prefabricated anti-pronation foot orthoses have been reported to reduce symptoms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of such orthoses on hip and knee kinematics, gluteal and vasti muscle activity, kinematic and electromyographic interactions alongside correlations with specific clinical measures.Methods: Eighteen asymptomatic individuals (11 male 7 female) had measures taken of static foot posture and ankle range of motion. Hip muscle activity and kinematics were measured using electromyography and an active motion capture system during a step-up task. Order of testing with or without orthoses was determined using a coin toss.Findings: Between condition paired t-tests indicated significantly reduced peak hip adduction angles (1.56, P < 0.05) and significantly reduced knee internal rotation (1.3 degrees, P < 0.05) in the orthoses condition. Reduced ankle dorsiflexion range of motion correlated with a reduction in hip adduction following the orthoses intervention (Gamma= 0.59, P = 0.013).Interpretation: The effects of prefabricated orthoses may be partially explained by kinematic alterations that occur proximal to the foot in the kinetic chain. These clinically and biomechanically relevant effects appear more evident in those with reduced underlying ankle motion. Further research is indicated using a symptomatic population to explore the clinical relevance of these observations. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The effect of assuming static or dynamic gaze behaviour on the estimated background luminance of drivers
PY  - 2019
AB  - Application of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage system for mesopic photometry requires that an estimate is made of the observers' state of luminance adaptation. This paper addresses an assumption made when estimating background luminance, a component of adaptation luminance. Specifically, using spatial sampling of the visual field we compare background luminances determined from assumptions of static or dynamic visual gaze, the former being a simplification, the latter being a better representation based on eye movements when driving. The comparison was undertaken with luminance images of urban scenes at night on three roads, two real and one simulated. It was found that background luminances were significantly higher when estimated using the dynamic assumption. It was also found that scene luminances at the point of foveal fixations tend to be higher than those luminances influencing peripheral regions of the retina. Compared with the background luminance estimated for a dynamic peripheral field, a horizon-centred 10 degrees circle led to a slightly higher estimate and the road surface luminance to a slightly lower estimate of background luminance.

TI  - The effect of botulinum toxin type-A injection on spasticity, range of motion and gait patterns in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy: An Egyptian study
PY  - 2004
AB  - Spasticity is defined as increased resistance to passive movement, secondary to hyperreflexia after an upper motor neuron lesion. In children with cerebral palsy (CP), it can interfere with mobility and self-care and can contribute to development of fixed myostatic contractures. This study investigated the efficacy of botulinum toxin type-A, a neuromuscular blocking agent that reduces muscle tone, in a variety of neuromuscular disorders, injections in a prospective, 3-month, controlled study involving 40 children with spastic diplegic CR The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (20 patients) entered a botulinum toxin type-A injection + physiotherapy rehabilitation program; Group 2 (20 patients) were given the physiotherapy rehabilitation program only. Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-treatment using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), dynamic gait pattern, ankle range-of-motion measurements and quantification of muscle denervation by nerve conduction techniques. The botulinum toxin type-A group demonstrated statistically significantly decreased spasticity, improved gait function and improved range of motion with evidence of partial denervation of the injected muscle compared to the control group. In conclusion, botulinum toxin type-A injections are a well-tolerated, nonsurgical technique that can improve overall response to physiotherapy.

TI  - The effect of cementation on the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the Rotliegendes sandstone
PY  - 1995
AB  - Understanding the mechanical properties of petroleum reservoirs is important for fracturing, wellbore stability, sand control, and subsidence prediction. Static, triaxial measurements of these properties, however, can be significantly different from dynamic, acoustic log derived measurements. The static measurements are more representative of the reservoirs properties but dynamic measurements afford a much greater coverage of the reservoir. This study examines the differences between static and dynamic mechanical properties for the Rotliegendes sandstones in quadrant 48 of the southern North Sea. Cores from 4 wells spanning a large range of porosity (4% to 22%) and mechanical properties were tested to develop a correlation between static and dynamic properties for this area and to understand the micromechanical basis for the static/dynamic differences. We find that dynamic Young's moduli are nearly twice the static values in the high porosity, low modulus samples but they are only 10% higher in the low porosity, high modulus samples. There are strong correlations between the dynamic/static modulus ratio and static modulus and between modulus and porosity. Pétrographie analysis shows that porosity is controlled mainly by clay and quartz cementation. Quartz cement appears much more effective in suturing grains together than clay cement based on differences in static/dynamic moduli between samples with clay versus quartz cement. Poisson's ratio also shows a strong dependence on porosity/cementation. The strong dependence between cementation and dynamic/static differences support recent theoretical (Sharma and Tutuncu, 1994; Guyer and McCall, 1994) models for the static-dynamic discrepancy. We find a linear relationship between the magnitude of the dynamic/static modulus ratio and the degree of non-linearity/hysteresis in the stress-strain curves. Rock Mechanics, Daemen & Schultz (eds).

TI  - The effect of continuous passive motion and sling exercise training on clinical and functional outcomes following total knee arthroplasty: a randomized active-controlled clinical study
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: The parallel-group randomized active-controlled clinical study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two in-hospital range of motion (ROM) exercise programs following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Continuous passive motion (CPM) is frequently used to increase ROM and improve postoperative recovery despite little conclusive scientific evidence. In contrast, a new active sling-based ROM therapy requires the activation of the knee joint muscles and dynamic joint stabilization. It was hypothesized that higher demands on muscle strength and muscle coordination during sling exercise training (ST) might be advantageous for early recovery following TKA.Methods: A total of 125 patients undergoing primary TKA were assessed for eligibility. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive ST or CPM (control intervention) during hospital stay. Patients were assessed before TKA for baseline measurement (pretest), 1 day before discharge (posttest) and 3 months after TKA (follow-up). The passive knee flexion range of motion (pFL) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included active knee flexion range of motion, active and passive knee extension ROM, static postural control, physical activity, pain, length of hospital stay as well as clinical, functional and quality-of-life outcomes (SF-36, HSS and WOMAC scores). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences between the groups were tested for significance by the unpaired Student's t test or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline, weight, sex, age, pain and physical activity.Results: A between-group difference could be determined at posttest. The pFL was significantly higher by 6.0 degrees (95% CI 0.9 to 11.2 degrees; P = 0.022) in the ST group. No difference between groups in pFL was documented at follow-up. Furthermore, no significant differences could be observed for any secondary outcome measure at posttest and follow-up.Conclusions: ST seems to have a clinically relevant beneficial short-term effect on pFL compared to CPM. The results support the implementation of ST in rehabilitation programs following TKA.

TI  - The effect of continuous passive motion duration and increment on range of motion in total knee arthroplasty patients
PY  - 1997
AB  - There is insufficient information on continuous passive motion (CPM) parameters in total knee arthroplasty patients for optimal patient outcomes. We compared CPM duration and increments on active and passive range of motion (ROM) in patients who underwent a unilateral total knee arthroplasty due to degenerative joint disease. forty-five total knee arthroplasty patients were randomly assigned to either a control group, a short CPM duration (3-5 hours per day) group with CPM ROM increased 5 degrees twice daily, a short CPM duration group with CPM,ROM increased daily to patient tolerance, a long CPM duration (10-12 hours per day) group with CPM ROM increased 5 degrees twice daily, or a long CPM duration group with CPM ROM increased daily to patient tolerance. Active and passive flexion and extension were measured goniometrically on each postoperative day that the patient was treated by physical therapy. No statistically significant differences between groups were found for baseline and final postoperative ROM. The CPM groups did not maintain the parameters assigned and were combined, revealing an enhanced rate oi change of flexion. Most patients opted for a CPM duration of between 4 and 8 hours per day and the patient-preferred CPM incremental increase in ROM was 6-7 degrees/day.

TI  - The effect of continuous passive motion on knee ligament reconstruction with carbon fibre. An experimental investigation
PY  - 1991
AB  - Our purpose was to determine whether continuous passive motion enhanced the quality of knee ligament reconstruction using carbon fibre. In 46 rabbits the medial collateral ligaments were excised and replaced with carbon fibre prostheses. The animals were treated postoperatively by either continuous passive motion, cast immobilisation or cage activity, termed intermittent active motion. At six weeks, the ligaments were compared histologically and biomechanically with normal (control) medial collateral ligaments and with sham-operated controls. The ligaments treated with continuous passive motion were superior to those in the other two treatment groups. There were no ligament failures in any of the groups. This study suggests that continuous passive motion, initiated immediately postoperatively, enhances the biomechanical properties of carbon fibre ligament replacement of the medial collateral ligament while preventing the harmful effects of joint immobilisation.

TI  - The effect of continuous passive motion on range of motion after total knee arthroplasty-a systematic review
PY  - 2010
AB  - Aims: Total knee arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Local practice involves the routine use of continuous passive motion (CPM) post-operatively to increase knee range of motion (ROM). However, it is unclear whether CPM, as an adjunct to physiotherapy is effective for the local population. This review aimed to appraise the available evidence on the effect of CPM on increasing ROM among patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Method(s): A literature search was done using the databases of Ovid, Pubmed and Google Scholar. Search terms used were "continuous passive motion" and "range of motion" and "total knee arthroplasty [MeSH]". Search was limited to randomised controlled trials and studies published in the English language. Three authors independently appraise and extract the data. A meta-analysis was done using random effects model for continuous variables. Result(s): Five relevant studies were found. All involved a relatively small sample size of 60-102 patients being randomly assigned to receive CPM and physiotherapy or physiotherapy only. However, the studies differed with regards to the duration of CPM administered as well as time of assessment of outcomes (ROM). Four studies were done in the acute hospital setting immediately after patients had TKA while 1 was carried out in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. Three of the more recent studies measured active knee flexion ROM. The mean difference between patient on CPM and those who were not, was 2.87 degrees (95% CI -0.37 to 6.12, P=0.08, I2=0%). The only study done in the rehabilitation setting also showed no significant difference in passive range of motion between patients randomly assigned to CPM plus physiotherapy or physiotherapy only. Conclusion(s): Evidence appraised has shown that CPM did increase ROM for patients post TKA. However, a difference of 2.87 degrees in active knee flexion is probably too small to be clinically significant. There is a need to review the routine use of CPM for patients post TKA.

PY  - 1983
AB  - The effect of continuous passive motion (CPM) on the clearance of blood from the knee joint and synovium was studied in 16 adolescent New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.1-2.3 kg). Two milliliters of autologous anticoagulated erythrocytes that had been labelled with indium-111-oxine and reconstituted in normal saline were injected into both knees in seven rabbits. With the left hind limb in a cast, quantitative scanning of each knee was performed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 using a collimated gamma camera. Throughout the experiment the left knee joint of each rabbit was immobilized, and the right knee joint was moved continuously from 40° to 110° of flexion, except during the scans. After the day 7 scan, the rabbits were killed and all tissues dissected from the knees, leaving the capsules intact. The intact knees were removed from the body and scanned. The joints were incised, irrigated, and rescanned. Sections of synovium were examined histologically. Nine additional rabbits were treated identically with unlabelled blood and killed one to seven days later for gross inspection. After three days there was no blood in the CPM knees, but some of the cast knees still contained blood after seven days. The rate of clearance was more than twice as fast with CPM than with cast immobilization (t1/2 = 2.2 versus t1/2 = 5.5 days; p < 0.001). Significantly less blood remained in the synovium after seven days with CPM than with cast immobilization (7.1% versus 13.2%; p < 0.01). Histologic examination showed less trapping of erythrocytes with CPM. Labelled erythrocytes were demonstrated free in the systemic circulation.

TI  - The effect of continuous passive movement at the ankle-joint on the haemodynamics of the lower limb
PY  - 1997
AB  - Despite of pharmacological and physiotherapeutical prophylaxis the development of a deep venous thrombosis represents a faithful complication of immobilising therapy regimen. The intensivation of physical administrations may prevent the manifestation of deep phlebothrombosis. Among the joint and muscle pumps which are hemodynamically active the so-called ankle-pump is of paramount importance. In this preclinical study we could show that continuous passive motion of the ankle joint with a special device system is able to stimulate the maximal venous flow in the deep venous system (V. femoralis communis; Duplex-technique) of normal volunteers and volunteers with chronic venous insufficiency. This increase of venous flow was accompanied by a significantly increase of arterial flow in both groups. The results of this study pointed out the hemodynamical effect of passive motion of the ankle-pump.

TI  - The effect of different stretching protocols on vertical jump measures in college age gymnasts
PY  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gymnastics is a sport that requires rapid display of explosive power expressed through the vertical jump. Recent studies have shown that a static-stretching based warm-up is ineffective for explosive power development. The aim of this study was to compare different stretching protocols and their effect on vertical jump measures. METHODS: Eleven gymnasts (9 males, 2 females; 23.18±2.52 yrs) participated in this randomized crossover study. Participants were measured on the countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SQJ), and depth jump (DJ) at baseline (no warm-up). Participants were then randomly placed into one of four stretching protocols: Static (ST), dynamic (DY), static + dynamic (ST+DY), and dynamic + static (DY+ST) and tested on the CMJ, SQJ, and DJ. A photoelectric cell device was used to measure vertical jump height (VJH), flight time (FT), power output (PO), and Reactive Strength Index (RSI). The non-parametric Friedman test was used to test differences between stretching protocols. RESULTS: The DY protocol showed significant improvements in VJH, FT, and PO in the CMJ. The ST, ST+DY, and DY+ST protocols did not show any significant improvements. CONCLUSIONS: A warm-up consisting of dynamic movements that resemble those used in the sport of gymnastics can improve vertical jump measures, as reflected through the CMJ. © 2019 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA

TI  - The effect of dynamic vessel motion on haemodynamic parameters in the right coronary artery: a combined MR and CFD study
PY  - 2009
AB  - Human right coronary artery (RCA) haemodynamics is investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on subject-specific information from magnetic resonance (MR) acquisitions. The dynamically varying vascular geometry is reconstructed from MR images, incorporated in CFD in conjunction with pulsatile flow conditions obtained from MR velocity mapping performed on the same subject. The effects of dynamic vessel motion on instantaneous and cycle-averaged haemodynamic parameters, such as wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI), are examined by comparing an RCA model with a time-varying geometry and those with a static geometry, corresponding to nine different time-points in the cardiac cycle. The results show that the TAWSS is similar for the dynamic and static wall models, both qualitatively and quantitatively (correlation coefficient 0.89-0.95). Conversely, the OSI shows much poorer correlations (correlation coefficient 0.38-0.60), with the best correspondence being observed with the static models constructed from images acquired in late diastole (at t=0 and 800 ms, the cardiac cycle is 900 ms). These findings suggest that neglecting dynamic motion of the RCA is acceptable if TAWSS is the primary focus but may result in underestimation of haemodynamic parameters related to the oscillatory nature of the blood flow.

TI  - The effect of dynamic visual noise on event-related potential component reflecting concrete word processing
PY  - 2010
AB  - To examine how and when a visual imagery process is involved with word processing, we investigated the effects of visual imagery disruption on the event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by concrete and abstract words. Twelve healthy adults participated in this experiment, for which they were required to judge the imageability of auditorily presented noun stimuli. Of the participants, half were presented with dynamic visual noise (DVN) during the task; half were presented with a gray-colored static screen (control group). Results showed that the ERPs to concrete words were more negative relative to the ERPs to abstract words in early and late time windows. In the early time window, a significant negative shift effect was found in the control group, but not in the DVN group. In the late time window, the negative shift was not significant in either group. Results suggest that the negative shift effect in the early time window reflects a qualitative difference between the processing of concrete and abstract words, and the contribution of visual imagery processing to concrete word processing.

TI  - The effect of fiber recruitment on the swelling of a pressurized anisotropic non-linearly elastic tube
PY  - 2007
AB  - We study the effect of fiber recruitment on the mechanical response of a fiber reinforced non-linearly elastic tube that is both swollen and pressurized. Attention is restricted to cylindrically symmetric tube deformation. The constitutive model permits fibers to support tension, but not compression. While many combinations of pressure and swelling cause all of the fibers to be recruited for load support, both large swelling and large deswelling can give rise to fiber derecruitment at certain locations in the tube. This leads to less channel opening than would be the case if the fibers provided support while contracted. The transition between mechanically active and mechanically inactive fibers can be described in terms of the quasi-static motion of a fiber recruiting interface. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The operation of a mechanical seal is clearly influenced by the dynamic movements that take place between the rotating and stationary components of a pump. An examination is presented of this influence on mechanical seal behaviour The dynamic movements result from static misalignments arising from the squareness and concentricity of the locating and mounting surfaces, alignment of the rotor with respect to the stator, and from dynamic effects caused by vibration induced by the basic pump design, operation of the pump under normal and upset operating conditions, distortions of the pump due to temperature and pressure changes, and vibration arising from manufacture or installation.

TI  - The effect of glenosphere diameter in reverse shoulder arthroplasty on muscle force, joint load, and range of motion
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Little is known about the effects of glenosphere diameter on shoulder joint loads. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to investigate the effects of glenosphere diameter on joint load, load angle, and total deltoid force required for active abduction and range of motion in internal/external rotation and abduction.Methods: A custom, instrumented reverse shoulder arthroplasty implant system capable of measuring joint load and varying glenosphere diameter (38 and 42 mm) and glenoid offset (neutral and lateral) was implanted in 6 cadaveric shoulders to provide at least 80% power for all variables. A shoulder motion simulator was used to produce active glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motion. All implant configurations were tested with active and passive motion with joint kinematics, loads, and moments recorded.Results: At neutral and lateralized glenosphere positions, increasing diameter significantly increased joint load (+12 +/- 21 N and +6 +/- 9 N; P <.01) and deltoid load required for active abduction (+9 +/- 22 N and +11 +/- 15 N; P<.02), whereas joint load angle was unaffected (P>.8). Passive internal rotation was reduced with increased diameter at both neutral and lateralized glenosphere positions (-6 degrees +/- 6 degrees and -12 degrees +/- 6 degrees; P <.002); however, external rotation was not affected (P >.05). At neutral glenosphere position, increasing diameter increased the maximum angles of both adduction (+1 degrees +/- 1 degrees; P =.03) and abduction (+8 degrees +/- 9 degrees; P <. 05). Lateralization also increased abduction range of motion compared with neutral (P <.01).Conclusions: Although increasing glenosphere diameter significantly increased joint load and deltoid force, the clinical impact of these changes is presently unclear. Internal rotation, however, was reduced, which contradicts previous bone modeling studies, which we postulate is due to increased posterior capsular tension as it is forced to wrap around a larger 42 mm implant assembly.

TI  - The effect of haptic learning on the integration of disparity and perspective for the dynamic and static slant perception
PY  - 2001
AB  - Ernst et al (2000, Nature Neuroscience) reported that haptic feedback increases the weight of a consistent surface-slant signal relative to inconsistent signals. In their experiment, the visual and haptic slants are static during both the training (learning) and the test (measurement) phases. In this study, we investigated the effects of dynamic haptic learning on the weights of disparity and perspective for the dynamic and static slant perception to explore the extent of the effect of the haptic learning among the stimuli with different aspects of temporal property. In the haptic learning phase, the subjects rotated the real circular paddle with both hands actively and viewed a virtual surface at the corresponding position of the real paddle through a mirror stereoscope. One of the visual depth cues for the perception of surface slant, disparity or perspective, was changing to synchronize with the rotation of the real paddle to present the consistent information with the haptic slant. In the test phase, the visual circle rotating (dynamic stimulus) or slanted (static stimulus) about the vertical axis was presented using the stereoscope. It had the depth cues of disparity and perspective, which indicated different angles. The subjects responded the perceived slants for the stimuli with various combinations of disparity and perspective cues to measure the weights between them for perceiving a slant. The test phases were performed before and after the haptic learning phase and the weights measured in the phases are compared. The results showed that the clear differences of weights before and after the haptic learning were not observed for both dynamic and static conditions.

TI  - The effect of injections of botulinum toxin type A combined with casting on the equinus gait of children with cerebral palsy
PY  - 2010
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the effect of adding inhibitory casting to the treatment of young children with cerebral palsy who received injections of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) to gastrocnemius for equinus gait. Of the 20 patients in the series, 11 in group A had inhibitory casts applied on the day of the first set of BoNT-A injections and nine in group B did not have casting.Both groups received another BoNT-A injection four months later. The patients were followed for eight months and examined at five intervals. Both groups showed significant improvement in gait parameters and function (p < 0.0001) and selective motor control (p = 0.041, -0.036) throughout the study. Group A had significantly better passive dorsiflexion of the ankle (p = 0.029), observational gait score (p = 0.006) and selective motor control (p = 0.036). We conclude that the addition of inhibitory casting enhances and prolongs the results of treatment and mainly influences the passive range of movement, while BoNT-A mostly influences the dynamic motion. The second injection further improved the results of most parameters. The gross motor function measure, the selective motor control test and the modified Tardieu scale correlated well with the results of treatment.We recommend the use of inhibitory casting whenever augmentation of the effect of treatment with BoNT-A is needed.

TI  - The effect of instability resistance training on neuromuscular performance in athletes after anterior cruciate ligament injury
PY  - 2009
AB  - The study evaluates effects on static and dynamic balance, speed of step initiation and the soccer kick after instability resistance training in athletes after ACL injury. A group of 14 soccer players (age 21.8 ± 3.4 y, height 182.2 ± 5.6 cm, and weight 76.7 ± 4.8 kg) underwent two months after rehabilitation a combined resistance and balance exercises (in duration of 30 min) for a period of 12-weeks (4-5 sessions/week). Postural stability was evaluated under both static and dynamic conditions (wobble board and antero-posterior / medio-lateral tilted platforms) during bipedal and one-legged stance. The COP velocity was registered at 100 Hz by means of posturography system FiTRO Sway check based on dynamometric platform. Speed of step initiation and the soccer kick was measured using FiTRO Dyne Premium. Pre-training measurements showed the non-injured-to-injured leg percent differences of 15.7% for static and 24.5% for dynamic balance. Following the training there were no changes in static balance on both legs (from 18.2 ± 3.3 mm/s to 15.8 ± 2.8 mm/s), on non-injured leg (from 41.3 ± 8.8 mm/s to 38.2 ± 7.8 mm/s), and on injured leg (from 49.0 ± 8.9 mm/s to 43.2 ± 7.7 mm/s). Likewise, the dynamic balance did not change while standing on both legs (from 95.2 ± 19.0 mm/s to 86.7 ± 17.8 mm/s) and on non-injured leg (from 112.3 ± 25.0 mm/s to 101.2 ± 21.8 mm/s), however a significant (p ≤ 0.01) improvement on injured leg has been found (from 148.7 ± 22.8 mm/s to 118.0 ± 20.0 mm/s). In addition, the COP velocity significantly (p ≤ 0.05) decreased during bipedal stance on M-L tilted platform (from 134.2 ± 20.1 mm/s to 110.6 ± 18.2 mm/s) but not on those A-P tilted (from 120.6 ± 19.7 mm/s to 104.7 ± 18.0 mm/s). Furthermore, mean run-out speed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased on injured leg (from 347.4 ± 42.3 cm/s to 385.3 ± 38.8 cm/s) but not on non-injured leg (from 378.1 ± 42.1 cm/s to 371.8 ± 47.1 cm/s). However, no changes in mean kick-off speed on injured and non-injured leg have been found (from 474.0 ± 38.5 cm/s to 515.6 ± 43.3 cm/s and from 475.9 ± 40.7 cm/s to 499.5 ± 37.6 cm/s). It may be concluded that resistance exercises performed on unstable surfaces represent an effective means for the improvement of dynamic balance under various conditions and speed of step initiation in athletes after ACL injury. However more specific exercises should be implemented into training program in order to improve sport-specific skills like the kick-off speed. Introduction Traumatic injuries of the knee joint leading to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent in sport. After conservative treatment some of the individuals return to their preinjury functional level, whereas others present with functional instability. Among the variables that might be related to the presence of functional instability caused by ACL deficiency, deficits in proprioceptive mechanisms have received considerable attention. In most of the studies (e.g., Barrack et al., 1989; Corrigan et al., 1992; MacDonald et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 1999) a reduction in proprioceptive acuity in individuals with ACL injuries has been demonstrated. In particular, higher threshold of perception of passive motion in individuals with ACL rupture when compared to healthy controls (Roberts et al., 1999) and when compared injured and non-injured legs of individuals with ACL damage (Barrack et al., 1989; MacDonald et al., 1996) has been found. In addition, repositioning errors have been documented as a result of ACL injury (Barret, 1991; Corrigan et al., 1992). On the other hand, a few studies failed to demonstrate these deficits in individuals with ACL injury (Friden et al., 1998; Good et al., 1999). Fonseca et al (2005) proved that individuals with good functional and muscular performance did not present proprioceptive deficits measured throught tests of position sense and threshold of detection of passive movement. It may be assumed that a decline in functional and muscular performance could also lead to a reduction in proprioceptive acuity. It is therefore important to continue in rehabilitation after conservative treatment in order to maintain or even improve the performance.

TI  - The effect of jump distance on biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury during landing and their relationship with sensorimotor characteristics at the knee
PY  - 2015
AB  - There has been an abundance of research investigating risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and demonstrating the importance of biomechanical characteristics, particularly in females. However, there have been many different landing tasks used with varying demands. Previous research has demonstrated that different landing tasks significantly alter demand and biomechanical characteristics. However it is unknown how changes in landing demand using the same task may alter landing biomechanics related to ACL injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of jump distance during a double-leg stop-jump on biomechanical risk factors of ACL injury and muscle activation and examine the contribution of sensorimotor characteristics on these biomechanical characteristics.   Fifty-three recreationally active healthy females were recruited to participate in this study. Each participant underwent a single test session that included demographic and anthropometric assessment, dominant knee threshold to detect passive motion, landing biomechanics and muscle activation measurement, and dominant knee time to peak torque and peak torque testing. Biomechanical and muscle activation parameters relative to ACL injury were compared between jump distances using repeated measures ANOVA. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between the biomechanical characteristics and sensorimotor characteristics (threshold to detect passive motion, time to peak torque, and peak torque).   The results of this study demonstrated that increases in jump distance significantly increased landing demand and significantly impacted risk factors for ACL injury and muscle activation strategies. These findings illustrated that studies utilizing tasks with different demands cannot directly compare results or make inference to injury risk based previous findings. This study suggested that a jump distance of 40% to 60% body height is used during a double-leg stop-jump task to assess landing biomechanics related to ACL injury. Additionally, sensorimotor characteristics had significant relationships with knee flexion angle at initial contact, peak knee flexion, and peak knee abduction moment. Further research is needed to identify sensorimotor characteristics that contribute to frontal plane knee motion during landing.

PY  - 1990
AB  - Patients with unilateral (left-sided) spatial neglect following right-hemisphere stroke were tested for the effects of visual stimulation on performance of a line-bisection task. As predicted from research on brain mechanisms of spatial orientation and attention, dynamic visual stimuli presented on the left side substantially reduced neglect in the task. In contrast, left sided static stimuli reduced neglect significantly less and dynamic stimuli presented in the center had no effect on neglect. Neglect patients with hemianopia did not show significantly less benefit of left-sided dynamic stimuli compared to neglect patients without hemianopia, suggesting that the effect of these stimuli was unconscious and automatic. The potential advantages of lateralized dynamic stimuli in the rehabilitation of neglect are discussed. © 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

TI  - The effect of limb movement on the lumbopelvic region in people with low back pain
PY  - 2009
AB  - Low back pain (LBP) affects up to 80% of the population at some point in their lifetime. Several models have been proposed to explain the persistent and recurrent course of LBP. In particular, the Movement System Impairment model proposes that lumbopelvic motion that begins soon after the start of an active movement is important to LBP because of its potential contribution to increased frequency of lumbopelvic motion across the day. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine aspects of this model, focusing specifically on lumbopelvic motion during limb movements.   In Chapter 2, we examine whether men and women with LBP differ in the prevalence of movement impairments during standardized clinical tests. We report that a larger proportion of men than women demonstrate early lumbopelvic motion during limb movement tests and movement tests potentially affected by limb tissue stiffness, but not during a movement test unaffected by limb tissue stiffness. In Chapter 3, we examine differences in lumbopelvic motion between people with and people without LBP during two active limb movement tests. We report that, compared to people without LBP, people with LBP demonstrate a greater magnitude of and earlier lumbopelvic rotation during knee flexion and hip lateral rotation. In Chapter 4, we examine the relationship between lumbopelvic motion during passive and active hip lateral rotation in people with and people without LBP. We report that people with LBP, but not people without LBP, demonstrate a relationship between lumbopelvic motion during passive and active hip lateral rotation. In Chapter 5, we examine how effectively people with and people without LBP modify lumbopelvic motion during active hip lateral rotation following within-session instruction. We report that all people are able to modify lumbopelvic motion during hip lateral rotation, but that people with LBP are less effective at modifying lumbopelvic motion than people without LBP. The results of this dissertation suggest that lumbopelvic motion during limb movements is important to the course of a LBP problem. Further studies could investigate the factors contributing to lumbopelvic motion during limb movements and intervention strategies to address lumbopelvic motion during limb movements.

TI  - The effect of limb movements on the regulation of depth and rate of breathing
PY  - 1976
AB  - In anesthetized dogs and rabbits passive or active limb movements (1) shifted to the left the relationship between tidal volume (Vt) and inspiratory time (Ti), (2) lowered the relationship between expiratory time (Te) and Ti and decreased its slope, and (3) increased the output to the inspiratory muscles (Vt/Ti). These effects increased with increasing the frequency of movements. Similar effects were obtained after vagotomy. When the stimulus was started during expiration. Te was shortened in spite of the previous unaffected Ti. Arterial PCO2 during exercise was similar (active movements) or below (passive movements) control value. Since other chemical and physical humoral factors do not seem involved, the whole increase of ventilation should be produced by neurogenic stimuli. The time course of Te, Ti and Vt/Ti at the onset and at the offset of limb movements indicates an abrupt and a slow component in the neurogenic drive. A single contraction of the limb during expiration or inspiration affected the timing and the Vt/Ti of 3-8 breaths. © 1976.

Relevance: Manual therapy has been shown effective in the rehabilitation of postfracture conditions in reducing pain, improving range of motion (ROM) and subjective rating of physical function. Various studies have been done but controversial findings were reported. In particular, there is a lack of common consensus on the choice of optimal manual techniques and principle of progress in treatment. Participants: 25 patients with Colles' fractures, managed with pins and/or plaster casts, participated in this study. Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two different physiotherapy programs. Conventional physiotherapy (PT) treatments involved advice and exercises to improve functional range of pain free active motion, strength and stability. Patients in the Manual Therapy (MT) Group received manual muscle relaxation and stretching techniques, median nerve-gliding techniques and joint mobilisation techniques in addition to the conventional physiotherapy treatments. Physiotherapy protocol involved a 4-week course of treatment. Analysis: Repeated measures ANOVA was used. Results: Outcome measures were change in impairment (wrist range of motion, grip strength, and pain rating) and change in activity (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, Jebsen Test of Hand Function) from initial assessment (after cast removal) to follow-up (four weeks later). The manual therapy group had a greater reduction in pain (p = 0.01); and better functional outcomes (p = 0.001) compared to the conventional physiotherapy group. Fracture union with more than 10 degrees of dorsal tilt (in 4 cases)was associated with increased difficulty with everyday activities and work, while union with a step in the radiocarpal articular surface (in 2 cases) was associated with loss of wrist mobility and difficulty with fine dextrous tasks. Muscle relaxation techniques, median nerve-gliding techniques and passive joint mobilisation techniques increased the range of motion more significantly in manual therapy group (p = 0.001). There was statistically significant difference in the number of treatment sessions: on average 15.6 for manual techniques versus 19.2 for conventional physiotherapy (p = 0.001). Conclusions: This study found that manual therapy did add to the effectiveness of a regimen of advice and exercises for patients following Colles' fracture. The clinical comparison showed that manual therapy techniques were more effective than conventional physiotherapy in regaining wrist joint mobility and improving overall function, and also that they required less treatment sessions. Implications: This study provides scientific evidence to justify the role of different physiotherapy management in this condition.

TI  - The effect of mastectomy and radiotherapy for breast carcinoma on soft tissues of the shoulder and its joint mobility among Egyptian patients.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Patients with post mastectomy soft tissue shoulder disorders usually benefit from various lines of physiotherapy treatment. However, the controversy about their efficacy persists. The aim of this work was to study and assess the efficacy of each, and to identify the best intervention. One hundred female patients with ipsilateral post mastectomy shoulder problems were enrolled in the study, from September 2003 until December 2004. They were followed up for 32 weeks. Mastectomy, both radical and conservative and axillary lymph node clearance, was the standard surgery applied for operable breast carcinoma in this series. Clinical examination was followed by testing for the shoulder complaint by measuring maximal protrusion at the inferior scapular angle, scapular stabilization and the lift-off tests. Approved physiotherapy modalities were then applied, viz: no treatment (randomly chosen 12 patients), passive and active motion therapy (14 patients), oral diclofenac sodium (19 patients), local triamcinilone injection (40 patients) and manually applied low intensity laser therapy (15 patients). Assessment was by determining overall success rate for each intervention modality. Intervention outcome was assessed at 8, 16, and 32 weeks as shown by physical examination using the healthy shoulder as a reference, and by measuring restricted mobility during passive lateral rotation and glenohumeral abduction. "Success rate" was determined separately for each group at the end of the intervention period. The applied surgery was followed by radiotherapy in 96%, chemotherapy in 24% and both in 11%. The presenting post mastectomy symptoms at the shoulder were pain (100%), shoulder weakness (88%), winging of the scapula (11%) and inability to perform everyday shoulder movements (23%). Evaluation was by overall improvement score. The results were: 14.3% for untreated patients, 43.3% for those treated by motion therapy, 42% for diclofenac therapy, 80.7% for local triamcinolone, and lastly 68% for low intensity laser therapy. All treatment regimens for shoulder disabilities in those patients gave little long-term advantage, local steroid injections were the most effective. Low level laser therapy may augment its effect. It is concluded that all treatment regimens provide little long-term advantage; however, trimcinilone local injections may be the most useful in terms of pain relief and improvement in shoulder movement.

TI  - The effect of motion on visual acuity of the compound eye: A theoretical analysis
PY  - 1975
AB  - Spatial resolution of moving objects is examined at the level of the photoreceptor axons on a theoretical basis using a linear description of the receptor potential for low object contrasts, and computer simulation with a nonlinear model for high object contrasts. It is shown that: 1. (1) the dynamic properties of transduction by the photoreceptors can cause visual acuity to be significantly affected by motion within the domain of biologically meaningful velocities; 2. (2) eyes with better static visual acuity need faster photoreceptor dynamics if their visual acuity is to be retained up to a reasonable velocity. This requirement appears to be met by the compound eyes of several different species, and in a given eye as it changes its state of adaptation. © 1975.

TI  - The effect of motor action and different sensory modalities on terrain classification in a quadruped robot running with multiple gaits
PY  - 2014
AB  - Discriminating or classifying different terrains is an important ability for every autonomous mobile robot. A variety of sensors, preprocessing techniques, and algorithms in different robots were applied. However, little attention was paid to the way sensory data was generated and to the contribution of different sensory modalities. In this work, a quadruped robot traversing different grounds using a variety of gaits is used, equipped with a collection of proprioceptive (encoders on active, and passive compliant joints), inertial, and foot pressure sensors. The effect of different gaits on classification performance is assessed and it is demonstrated that separate terrain classifiers for each motor program should be employed. Furthermore, poor performance of randomly generated motor commands confirms the importance of coordinated behavior on sensory information structuring. The collection of sensors sensitive to active, "tactile", terrain exploration proved effective. Among the individual modalities, encoders on passive compliant joints delivered best results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of movement frequency on interlimb coupling during recumbent stepping
PY  - 2005
AB  - During passive lower limb movement, active use of the upper limbs increases unintentional lower limb muscle activation. We hypothesized that faster movement frequencies would amplify lower limb muscle activation during upper limb exertion but would not affect lower limb muscle activation when the upper limbs were relaxed. We studied 10 healthy participants exercising on a recumbent stepping machine that mechanically coupled the four limbs via handles and pedals. Participants exercised at four frequencies (30, 60, 90, 120 steps/min) under four conditions of active and passive movement. Self-driven lower limb motion resulted in greater muscle activation compared to externally driven lower limb motion. Muscle activation amplitude increased with frequency for all conditions except for externally driven stepping. These results indicate that fast upper limb movement facilitates neuromuscular recruitment of lower limb muscles during stepping tasks. If a similar effect occurs in neurologically impaired individuals during active stepping, self-assisted exercise might enhance neuromuscular recruitment during rehabilitation.

TI  - The effect of muscle loading on the kinematics of in vitro glenohumeral abduction
PY  - 2007
AB  - This in vitro study evaluated the effects of four different muscle-loading ratios on active glenohumeral joint abduction. Eight cadaveric shoulders were tested using a shoulder simulator designed to reproduce unconstrained abduction of the humerus via computer-controlled pneumatic actuation. Forces were applied to cables that were sutured to tendons or fixed to bone, to simulate loading of the supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus/teres minor, and anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid muscles. Four sets of muscle-loading ratios were employed, based on: (1) equal loads, (2) average physiological cross-sectional areas (pCSAs), (3) constant values of the product of electromyographic (EMG) data and pCSAs, and (4) variable ratios of the EMG and pCSA data which changed as a function of abduction angle. The investigator generated passive motions with no muscle loads simulated. Repeatability was quantified by five successive trials of the passive and simulated active motions.There was improved repeatability in the simulated active motions versus passive motions, significant for abduction angles less than 40 degrees (p = 0.02). No difference was found in the repeatability of the four different muscle-loading ratios for simulated active motions (P >= 0.067 for all angles). The improved repeatability of active over passive motion suggests simulated active motion should be employed for in vitro simulations of shoulder motion. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of musculus extensor digitorum brevis transfer for chronic lateral ankle instability
PY  - 1998
AB  - Thirty-eight patients who had undergone surgery for instability of their ankles between 1980 and 1994 answered questionnaires regarding the results. In 32 of the 38 patients, clinical examinations were performed including practice on a balancing board, circle-running tests, and active and passive electromyographic measurements on the musculus extensor digitorum brevis (MEDB).The questionnaires showed that 90% of the patients with a median observation time of 9 years (range, 16 months-14 years) were content with the results of their operations, and the number of painful distortions of the ankle were reduced considerably in 96% of the patients, Within the group of active sportspersons with more than 4 hours of weekly exercise, 42% returned to their previous levels of sports activity. The tendency to have ankle pain disappeared in 90% of the patients.At the clinical examination, the time spent on the balancing board was reduced by 25% for the operated foot. When the patient ran in a circle with the operated leg toward the center, as compared with running with the nonoperated leg toward the center, the time was enhanced by 8%.We found electromyographic activity in the MEDB during active movement of the toes and with passive supination of the talocrural joint but not during passive pronation of the foot. The MEDB transfer procedure not only strengthens the lateral ligaments but also seems to add proprioceptive protection to the ankle to prevent distortions.

TI  - The effect of negative intraarticular pressure and rotator cuff force on Glenohumeral translation during simulated active elevation
PY  - 2000
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of negative pressure in the intraarticular space and subacromial bursa, as well as rotator cuff force, on glenohumeral translation during active elevation.Design: Glenohumeral translation during elevation in the scapular plane was measured under greater than, less than, and equal to physiologic rotator cuff muscle force, as well as with and without the subacromial bursa and intraarticular space vented. Background: Negative intraarticular pressure has been shown to help stabilize the glenohumeral joint in passive motion, although the effect on translation during active motion has not been investigated.Methods: Eight cadaverous human shoulder specimens were tested in a dynamic shoulder simulator. Forces in the muscles of the rotator as well as the middle deltoid muscle were simulated using servohydraulic cylinders. Joint motion was measured using an ultrasonic motion analysis system.Results: Superior translation of the humerus increased 1.2 mm (SD, 0.4) upon venting of the bursa, and 2.1 mm (SD, 1.7) upon venting of the joint capsule at 25 degrees of glenohumeral elevation in the scapular plane. At 90 degrees elevation, venting the bursa did not change superior translation but increased anterior translation 1.04 mm (SD, 1.0). Venting of the joint capsule increased superior translation by 2.8 mm (SD, 2.5). Decreasing rotator cuff force increased superior translation, while reducing it did not.Conclusion: The muscles of the rotator cuff and the negative pressure of the intraarticular space and the subacromial bursa stabilize the glenohumeral joint since they restrict translation in the superior and anterior directions.

TI  - The effect of optotype contrast and chromaticity on dynamic visual acuity
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose: Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) plays an important role in tasks such as driving and sports, and can be influenced by features such as contrast and chromaticity. Research has shown that low contrast results in worse static and dynamic VA; however the impact of chromaticity on static and dynamic VA is unclear. This study examines the impact of contrast and chromaticity on DVA. Methods: 42 participants were assigned to one of two study blocks: 1) Contrast (n=21), 2) Chromatic (n=21). Each block consisted of 2 study visits that were a minimum of 2 weeks apart. At each visit, DVA was measured using moV& (V&MP Vision Suite). Contrast block testing measured DVA at 44% and 10% contrast. Chromatic block testing measured DVA using a red target/white background and a white target/blue background. Within each block, tests were run with a constant target size (+0.8, +0.6, or +0.4 logMAR above static VA threshold) and increasing target speed, as well as with a constant target speed (1, 3, 6, 9, or 12m/s) with decreasing target size. Horizontal, vertical, oblique, and random walk motion trajectories were used. DVA and speed thresholds were compared between contrast levels and colour combinations. Results: As target contrast decreased from 44% to 10%, DVA and speed threshold significantly worsened for all trajectories measured (p < 0.05). Overall, there was a significant effect of chromaticity on DVA with the white/blue combination yielding better DVA compared to red/white (mean logMAR DVA: red/white = 0.37 ± 0.19; white/blue = 0.33 ± 0.18, p < 0.05). However, chromaticity did not have a significant effect on speed threshold (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): DVA is worse at lower contrast and with red letters on a white background. Speed thresholds are also worse at low contrast, but chromaticity does not appear to impact speed thresholds on this task. Further investigation into additional chromaticity combinations is needed to better understand this phenomenon.

TI  - The effect of optotype size and velocity parameters on the performance of healthy young adult subjects on the gaze stabilization test
PY  - 2013
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of the current study was to examine the influence of the optotype (the letter E) size, presentation time, and head velocity on gaze stabilization test (GST) performance. BACKGROUND: The gaze stabilization test is a functional measure of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy young subjects (mean age, 26 ± 4; range, 21-34, 10 male subjects) performed the computerized GST. Testing was repeated several times using different combinations of the optotype size and presentation time over a wide range of head velocities (<60 to >220 degrees per second). The sizes examined were 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 logMAR above the subject's static visual acuity (SVA). The presentation times examined were 20, 30, and 40 ms above the subject's minimum perception time (mPT). RESULTS: Performance varied considerably based on the optotype parameters used in the GST. The optotype combination of SVA + 0.20 logMAR and mPT + 20 ms was the most difficult combination with the average of all subjects' performance less than 64% at all velocities. The optotype combination SVA + 0.30 logMAR and mPT + 40 ms was the easiest combination with subjects being able to correctly identify the optotype at any head velocity with greater than 70% average accuracy. Increasing the head velocity in any size/time combination caused deterioration in subjects' performance. CONCLUSION: Our study findings show that optotype parameters have significant influence on subjects' performance on the GST. © 2013, Otology &Neurotology, Inc.

TI  - The effect of passive movement training on angiogenic factors and capillary growth in human skeletal muscle
PY  - 2010
AB  - The effect of a period of passive movement training on angiogenic factors and capillarization in skeletal muscle was examined. Seven young males were subjected to passive training for 90 min, four times per week in a motor-driven knee extensor device that extended one knee passively at 80 cycles min-1. The other leg was used as control. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. v. lateralis of both legs before as well as after 2 and 4 weeks of training. After the training period, passive movement and active exercise were performed with both legs, and muscle interstitial fluid was sampled from microdialysis probes in the thigh. After 2 weeks of training there was a 2-fold higher level of Ki-67 positive cells, co-localized with endothelial cells, in the passively trained leg which was paralleled by an increase in the number of capillaries around a fibre (P < 0.05). Capillary density was higher than pre-training at 4 weeks of training (P < 0.05). The training induced an increase in the mRNA level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the angiopoietin receptor Tie-2 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in the passively trained leg and MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 mRNA were elevated in both legs. Acute passive movement increased (P < 0.05) muscle interstitial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels 4- to 6-fold above rest and the proliferative effect, determined in vitro, of the muscle interstitial fluid similar to 16-fold compared to perfusate. The magnitude of increase was similar for active exercise. The results demonstrate that a period of passive movement promotes endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenic factors and initiates capillarization in skeletal muscle.

TI  - The effect of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome
PY  - 2008
AB  - Proprioception has been found to have a relation to subjective knee function and patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) seem to have larger deficits than asymptomatic individuals little is known about whether taping can restore defects in proprioception or by which mechanisms it can improve anterior knee pain. To determine the effect of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception a pre and post intervention repeated measures design was conducted on 25 male with PFPS (23.6 ± 3.04 years) and 25 healthy male (23.5 ± 3.1 years). Active angle reproduction, passive angle reproduction, and threshold to detection of passive movement tests were measured. Each of the tests was done under taped and no-taped conditions in 20 and 60 degree of knee flexion. We found significant difference between taped and no-taped conditions in active angle reproduction test for both groups (P < 0.05). The other tests did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05). Obtained results suggest that patellar taping may improve knee proprioception during active angle reproduction. Two groups could benefit from taping but further researches are needed to determine whether the present results are applicable to other situations or not. © 2008 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

TI  - The effect of peers' alcohol consumption on parental influence: A cognitive mediational model
PY  - 1999
AB  - Objective: The current study was designed to elucidate familial and social influences on adolescent alcohol consumption by testing three hypotheses derived from the prototype/willingness model of adolescent risk behavior: (I) parents prototypes of adolescent drinkers affect adolescent consumption through their impact on adolescents' prototypes. (2) strong parent-child relationships are associated with acceptance of parental influence regarding drinking and thus with less adolescent drinking and (3) association with peers who drink dilutes parental influence over adolescents' alcohol consumption. Method: Two hundred sixty-six rural adolescents, ages 15 through 17 at Time 1, and their parents and siblings completed questionnaires about drinking behavior and drinking-related cognitions at I-year intervals for 3 years. Results: Structural equation models provided evidence of transmission of prototypes of adolescent drinkers from parents to adolescents and evidence that these prototypes mediate adolescent alcohol consumption. They also provide evidence that although parents' prototypes and parent-adolescent relationships are important in shaping the adolescents' drinking, association with peers who drink significantly attenuates this influence. Conclusions: These data suggest that parents can influence their children's drinking, but that this influence has more of an impact if the adolescent is not involved in a drinking-conducive peer environment. The current analyses also suggest that the process of becoming an adolescent drinker involves an active rejection of parents' influence rather than a passive movement away from parents' attitudes and beliefs-a process that is accelerated by association with peers who drink.

PY  - 1994
AB  - Objective: We conducted a randomized, double blind clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and cervical spine. Methods: A controlled trial of 18 half-hour active or placebo treatments was conducted in 86 patients with OA of the knee and 81 patients with OA of the cervical spine, in which pain was evaluated using a 10 cm visual analog scale, activities of daily living using a series of questions (answered by the patient as never, sometimes, most of the time, or always), pain on passive motion (recorded as none, slight, moderate, or severe), and joint tenderness (recorded using a modified Ritchie scale). Global evaluations of improvement were made by the patient and examining physician. Evaluations were made at baseline, midway, end of treatment, and one month after completion of treatment. Results: Matched pair t tests showed extremely significant changes from baseline for the treated patients in both knee and cervical spine studies at the end of treatment and the one month followup observations, whereas the changes in the placebo patients showed lesser degrees of significance at the end of treatment, and had lost significance for most variables at the one month followup. Means of the treated group of patients with OA of the knee showed greater improvement from baseline values than the placebo group by the end of treatment and at the one month followup observation. Using the 2-tailed t test, at the end of treatment the differences in the means of the 2 groups reached statistical significance for pain, pain on motion, and both the patient overall assessment and the physician global assessment. The means of the treated patients with OA of the cervical spine showed greater improvement from baseline than the placebo group for most variables at the end of treatment and one month followup observations; these differences reached statistical significance at one or more observation points for pain, pain on motion, and tenderness. Conclusion: PEMF has therapeutic benefit in painful OA of the knee or cervical spine.

TI  - The effect of radial head excision and arthroplasty on elbow kinematics and stability
PY  - 2004
AB  - Background: Radial head fractures are common injuries. Comminuted radial head fractures often are treated with radial head excision with or without radial head arthroplasty. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of radial head excision and arthroplasty on the kinematics and stability of elbows with intact and disrupted ligaments. We hypothesized that elbow kinematics and stability would be (1) altered after radial head excision in elbows with intact and disrupted ligaments, (2) restored after radial head arthroplasty in elbows with intact ligaments, and (3) partially restored after radial head arthroplasty in elbows with disrupted ligaments.Methods: Eight cadaveric upper extremities were studied in an in vitro elbow simulator that employed computer-controlled actuators to govern tendon-loading. Testing was performed in stable, medial collateral ligament-deficient, and lateral collateral ligament-deficient elbows with the radial head intact, with the radial head excised, and after radial head arthroplasty. Valgus angulation and rotational kinematics were determined during passive and simulated active motion with the arm dependent. Maximum varus-valgus laxity was measured with the arm in a gravity-loaded position.Results: In specimens with intact ligaments, elbow kinematics were altered and varus-vaIgus laxity was increased after radial head excision and both were corrected after radial head arthroplasty. In specimens with disrupted ligaments, elbow kinematics were altered after radial head excision and were similar to those observed in specimens with a native radial head after radial head arthroplasty. Varus-valgus laxity was increased after ligament disruption and was further increased after radial head excision. Varus-valgus laxity was corrected after radial head arthroplasty and ligament repair; however, it was not corrected after radial head arthroplasty without ligament repair.Conclusions: Radial head excision causes altered elbow kinematics and increased laxity. The kinematics and laxity of stable elbows after radial head arthroplasty are similar to those of elbows with a native radial head. However, radial head arthroplasty alone may be insufficient for the treatment of complex fractures that are associated with damage to the collateral ligaments as arthroplasty alone does not restore stability to elbows with ligament injuries.Clinical Relevance: Kinematics are altered after radial head excision, even in elbows with intact ligaments, and additional clinical study is needed in order to determine the long-term effects of this instability. Radial head arthroplasty alone does not adequately restore stability to elbows that have a ligamentous injury, and concomitant repair of ligaments and muscular origins should be considered at the time of surgical repair.

TI  - The effect of radial head fracture size on elbow kinematics and stability
PY  - 2005
AB  - This study determined the effect of radial head fracture size and ligament injury on elbow kinematics. Eight cadaveric upper extremities were studied in an in vitro elbow simulator. Testing was performed with ligaments intact, with the medial collateral (MCL) or lateral collateral (LCL) ligament detached, and with both the MCL and LCL detached. Thirty degree wedges were sequentially removed from the anterolateral radial head up to 120degrees. Valgus angulation and external rotation of the ulna relative to the humerus were determined for passive motion, active motion, and pivot shift testing with the arm in a vertical (dependent) orientation. Maximum varus-valgus laxity was calculated from measurements of varus and valgus angulation with the arm in horizontal gravity-loaded positions. No effect of increasing radial head fracture size was observed on valgus angulation during passive and active motion in the dependent position. In supination, external rotation increased with increasing fracture size during passive motion with LCL deficiency and both MCL and LCL deficiency. With intact ligaments, maximum varus-valgus laxity increased with increasing radial head fracture size. With ligament disruption, elbows were grossly unstable, and no effect of increasing radial head fracture size occurred. During pivot shift testing, performed with the ligaments intact, Subtle instability was noted after resection of one-third of the radial head. In this in vitro biomechanical study, small subtle effects of radial head fracture size on elbow kinematics and stability were seen in both the ligament intact and ligament deficient elbows. These data suggest that fixation of displaced radial head fractures less than or equal to one-third of the articular diameter may have some biomechanical advantages; however, clinical correlation is required.

TI  - The effect of static and dynamic visual gestures on stuttering inhibition
PY  - 2011
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of steady-state and dynamic visual gestures of vowels in stuttering inhibition. Eight adults who stuttered recited sentences from memory while watching video presentations of the following visual speech gestures: (a) a steady-state /u/., (b) dynamic production of /a-i-u/, (c) steady-state /u/ with an accompanying audible 1 kHz pure tone, and (d) dynamic production of /a-i-u/ with an accompanying audible 1 kHz pure tone. A 1 kHz pure tone and a no-external signal condition served as control conditions. Results revealed a significant main effect of auditory condition on stuttering frequency. Relative to the no-external signal condition, the combined visual plus pure tone conditions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in stuttering frequency. In addition, a significant difference in stuttering frequency was also observed when the visual plus pure tone conditions were compared to the visual only conditions. However, no significant differences were observed between the no-external signal condition and visual only conditions, or the no-external signal condition and pure tone condition. These findings are in contrast to previous findings demonstrated by similar vowel gestures presented via the auditory modality that resulted in high levels of stuttering inhibition. The differential role of sensory modalities in speech perception and production as well as their individual capacities to transfer gestural information for the purposes of stuttering inhibition is discussed.

TI  - The effect of static versus dynamic stimuli on visual processing of sexual cues in androphilic women and gynephilic men
PY  - 2018
AB  - Models of sexual response posit that attentional processing of sexual cues is requisite for sexual responding. Despite hypothesized similarities in the underlying processes resulting in sexual response, gender differences in sexual arousal patterns are abundant. One such gender difference relates to the stimulus features (e.g. gender cues, sexual activity cues) that elicit a response in men and women. In this study, we examined how stimulus modality (static visual images versus dynamic audiovisual films) and stimulus features (gender, sexual activity and nonsexual contextual cues) influences attentional (i.e, gaze) and elaborative (i.e, self-reported attraction (SRA), self-reported arousal) processing of sexual stimuli. Men's initial and controlled attention was consistently gender-specific (i.e, greater attention towards female targets), and this was not influenced by stimulus modality or the presence of sexual activity cues. By contrast, gender-specificity of women's attention patterns differed as a function of attentional stage, stimulus modality and the features within the stimulus. Degree of specificity was positively predictive of SRA in both genders; however, it was not significantly predictive of self-reported arousal. These findings are discussed in the context of gendered processing of visual sexual information, including a discussion of implications for research designs.

TI  - The effect of structural-acoustic coupling on the active control of noise in vehicles
PY  - 2011
AB  - Active noise control systems offer a potential method of reducing the weight of passive acoustic treatment and, therefore, increasing vehicles' fuel efficiency. These can be particularly cost-efficient if integrated with the entertainment system. A combined system is presented employing feedforward control of engine noise and feedback control of road noise, using a 'modal' error signal. Due to the dependence of the feedback system on the modal response of the vehicle cabin, and the influence of structural-acoustic coupling on this response, the effects of structural-acoustic coupling upon the performance of the active noise control strategies is investigated. An elemental model of structural-acoustic coupling is derived and used to simulate the change in performance of the active control systems as a result of coupling; the feedforward component is largely unaffected by structural-acoustic coupling, whilst the modal feedback performance is reduced from 11 to 8 dB attenuation in total acoustic potential energy, due to the shift in the frequency of the targeted acoustic mode. The simulation results are confirmed through experiments conducted in a structural-acoustic coupled enclosure.

TI  - The effect of suture fixation of type I coronoid fractures on the kinematics and stability of the elbow with and without medial collateral ligament repair
PY  - 2007
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of suture repair of type 1 coronoid fractures on elbow kinematics in ligamentously intact and medial collateral ligament (MCL)-deficient elbows. Cadaveric testing was performed in stable and MCL-deficient elbows with radial head arthroplasty and with the coronoid intact, with the coronoid fractured, and after suture repair. Ulna versus humerus angulation was measured during active motion. Varus and valgus motion pathways were measured during passive gravity-loaded flexion. With intact ligaments, there was a small increase in valgus angulation after a type 1 fracture that was not corrected with suture fixation. With MCL deficiency, there was no change in kinematics regardless of coronoid status. Type 1 coronoid fractures cause only small changes in elbow kinematics that are not corrected with suture repair. MCL repair, rather than type I coronoid fixation, should be considered if the elbow remains unstable after radial head repair or replacement and lateral ligament repair.

TI  - The effect of taping on patellar position as determined by video fluoroscopy in patients with PFPS: a pilot study.
PY  - 2011
AB  - The mechanism and effect of patellar taping on patellar position has been questioned. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effect ofpatellar taping on patellar position as detennined by video-fluoroscopy in patients diagnosed witb patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) during a closed chain squatting activity. Five females (mean age = 26.0 + 4.65 years) diagnosed with PFPS without other acute lower extremity impainnents volunteered for this study. The subjects perfonned consecutive squats from 0 to 30 degrees knee flexion with the patella taped and without. Video fluoroscopy recorded the patellar motion in an anteroposterior view. Mediolateral patellar displacement was recorded at 0 degrees, 15 degrees, and 30 degrees ofknee flexion with tape and without. At 0 degrees and 15 degrees ofknee flexion in 7 out ofthe 10 (70%) cases the patella was re-aligned medially with tape as compared to one out of five (200A,) at 30 degrees. The results ofthis study suggest that the McConnell medial glide taping technique may 110t consistently re-align the patella medially in patients with lateral tracking ofthe patella during a closed chain squatting activity even though pain was abated witll the taping intervention. Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common lower extremity pathology fmmd in 30% ofpatients seen in an outpatient orthopedic clinic. I PFPS has been described as any irritation, inflammation, or pain around the patellofemoral joint. However, understanding of the pathophysiology and genesis ofthis syndrome is still uuder investigation.2-4 While the etiology of PFPS is multitudinous, mal-alignment or abnormal tracking is a frequently cited cause of PFPS.S.9 Patients diagnosed with PFPS have been noted to report pain during functional weight-bearing activities that place the lower extremity in a dynamic and closed chain position, sucll as ascending and descending stairs, inclined walking, and squatting.5.8-11 The conservative treatment for PFPS has focused on the use ofanti-inflammatory medications, quadricep muscle rehabilitation, bracing, and patellar taping.12 The patellar taping technique as described by McConnell purports to passively correct aspects ofpatellar tracking, including glide, tilt, and rotation.11This taping technique has been used to conservatively manage patellar mal-aligmuent, decrease pain, and enhance the quadricep muscle rehabilitation ill patients with PFPS. Studies using diagnostic tools have revealed a significant response to the taping procedure with the patella re-aligning medially to the normal position.13·14 However, evidence has shown that the patellar taping method could not withstand the stresses ofa strenuous exercise program in correcting the patella medially.13 Shellock reported that patellofemoral mal-alignment may be found in 93% of patients diagnosed with PFPS.15 However, little evidence has been presented to support this proposition. Crossley et al performed a review of 89 relevant articles noting that there was no documented evidence supporting the use of patellar taping.16 Patellar and femoral bony abnormalities, poor foot biomechanics, tight soft tissue structures, and a small vastus medialis oblique/vastus lateralis (VMOIVL) ratio may all contribute to patellofemoral mal-alignment. Previous studies have used radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine patellar tracking in a variety ofangles aud situations.B-ts,H-I!) None of these investigations have been performed during a dynamic interaction of the joint components during normal weightbearing The fluoroscope is a diagnostic tool that has the capability to examine the patellofemoral joint functioning in a dynamic, weight-bearing activity. A study using the fluoroscope examined patellar tracking during treadmill walking. Results revealed a tracking pattern that is very different from that which was assumed from the anatomy ofthe knee aud recorded in other studies that measured only passive motion or nonweight-bearing active motion ofthe knee. The current state of knowledge and research regarding the effectiveness of patellar taping with the diagnostic abilities of fluoroscopy in ADL is very limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect o fpatellar taping on patellar position as determined by video-fluoroscopy in patients diagnosed with PFPS during a closed chain squatting activity.

TI  - The effect of target contrast variation on dynamic visual acuity and eye movements
PY  - 1972
AB  - Contrast is important in determination of dynamic visual acuity (DVA). Reduced contrast produces decrement of performance because of two separate effects, one on static acuity and one on eye movement control. The effects of reduced contrast on eye movements for the experiment reported here are not marked, except at low contrast levels; decrease of target contrast produces increased latencies (for the initial eye movement latency and the subsequent saccadic movements), and decrease in the final pursuit velocity of the eye movement. In the present experiment the effect of contrast on eye movement control is masked by the compensation brought about by the increased size of targets presented. A study without the complicating effect of this increased target size would be of interest. An equivalence between the effects of reduced target contrast and increased target image velocity on DVA can be calculated. The data of the present paper allow the derivation of threshold sizes of targets with contrasts between 70 and 20 per cent, moving with angular velocities from 0 to 90°/sec. © 1972.

TI  - The effect of two different visual presentation modalities on the narratives of mainstream grade 3 children.
PY  - 2013
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a dynamic visual presentation method (a soundless animated video presentation) would elicit better narratives than a static visual presentation method (a wordless picture book).METHOD: Twenty mainstream grade 3 children were randomly assigned to two groups and assessed with one of the visual presentation methods. Narrative performance was measured in terms of micro- and macrostructure variables. Microstructure variables included productivity (total number of words, total number of T-units), syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit) and lexical diversity measures (number of different words). Macrostructure variables included episodic structure in terms of goal-attempt-outcome (GAO) sequences.RESULTS: Both visual presentation modalities elicited narratives of similar quantity and quality in terms of the micro- and macrostructure variables that were investigated.CONCLUSION: Animation of picture stimuli did not elicit better narratives than static picture stimuli.

TI  - The effect of vestibulo-ocular reflex deficits and covert saccades on dynamic vision in opioid-induced vestibular dysfunction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Patients with bilateral vestibular dysfunction cannot fully compensate passive head rotations with eye movements, and experience disturbing oscillopsia. To compensate for the deficient vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), they have to rely on refixation saccades. Some can trigger ''covert'' saccades while the head still moves; others only initiate saccades afterwards. Due to their shorter latency, it has been hypothesized that covert saccades are particularly beneficial to improve dynamic visual acuity, reducing oscillopsia. Here, we investigate the combined effect of covert saccades and the VOR on clear vision, using the Head Impulse Testing Device - Functional Test (HITD-FT), which quantifies reading ability during passive highacceleration head movements. To reversibly decrease VOR function, fourteen healthy men (median age 26 years, range 21- 31) were continuously administrated the opioid remifentanil intravenously (0.15 mg/kg/min). VOR gain was assessed with the video head-impulse test, functional performance (i.e. reading) with the HITD-FT. Before opioid application, VOR and dynamic reading were intact (head-impulse gain: 0.87×0.08, mean×SD; HITD-FT rate of correct answers: 90×9%). Remifentanil induced impairment in dynamic reading (HITD-FT 26×15%) in 12/14 subjects, with transient bilateral vestibular dysfunction (head-impulse gain 0.63×0.19). HITD-FT score correlated with head-impulse gain (R = 0.63, p = 0.03) and with gain difference (before/with remifentanil, R =-0.64, p = 0.02). One subject had a non-pathological head-impulse gain (0.82×0.03) and a high HITD-FT score (92%). One subject triggered covert saccades in 60% of the head movements and could read during passive head movements (HITD-FT 93%) despite a pathological head-impulse gain (0.59×0.03) whereas none of the 12 subjects without covert saccades reached such high performance. In summary, early catch-up saccades may improve dynamic visual function. HITD-FT is an appropriate method to assess the combined gaze stabilization effect of both VOR and covert saccades (overall dynamic vision), e.g., to document performance and progress during vestibular rehabilitation.

TI  - The effect of video-guidance on passive and active movements as assessed by fMRI: Useful for upper limb stroke rehabilitation?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background.- Passive and active movements as well as action observation have a positive impact on recovery of motor function in stroke patients [1,2]. Combining action observation and movement execution might therefore also be a useful tool for rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to explore the neural networks involved in this approach in healthy subjects. Methods.- Using fMRI block design, right hand movement performed by 17 right handed participants with (=imitation) and without visual guidance was investigated. The movement tasks included of both active execution of movement and passive movement, imposed by the examiner. Results.- Movement imitation caused cortical activation in bilateral occipitotemporal areas both in passive and active movement. However, only active imitation led to activation in right inferior and superior parietal lobule, left frontal areas and cerebellum, whereas passive imitation activated right prefrontal cortex and the left supplementary motor area (SMA). Conclusion.- These preliminary results indicate that different networks are activated during active and passive imitation tasks. The networks detected in our study are known to be important for functional recovery after stroke [3] and include attention, top-down control and reach to grasp movement for active imitation and a motor inhibitory network for passive imitation. These findings provide theoretical backing for the integration of active and passive movement with visual guidance in a new rehabilitation approach.

TI  - The effect of visual experience on texture segmentation without awareness
PY  - 2011
AB  - The effect of visual experience is usually investigated through active (task dependent) training in a discrimination task. In contrast, the current work explored the psychophysical and electrophysiological correlates of passive (task independent) visual experience in texture segmentation by using an inattentional blindness-like paradigm (Mack et al., 1992). The psychophysical and electrophysiological responses to a segmented line-texture bar, with texture elements oriented either congruently (parallel) or noncongruently (orthogonal) to bar orientation, were collected after both short and long passive experience, with the texture presented on the background while subjects performed a primary task.Subjects were not able to distinguish the orientation of the bar (psychophysical results) after either short or long passive experience. However, the short experience produced an electrophysiological correlate of texture segmentation (N150), and the amplitude of this component was greater for the parallel bar, demonstrating that it reflected not simply local orientation discontinuities but also texture boundary-surface orientation congruency. This configurational effect in texture segmentation, which occurred without awareness during passive viewing, disappeared when the subjects had previously discriminated the orientation of the bar and when experience was lengthened, probably as a consequence of adaptation. Our study provides the first ERP evidence that boundary-surface relations are available during short passive visual experiences of very salient texture images and are suppressed by long experience, probably because of adaptation.

TI  - The effect that auxiliary taxonomized auditory distractions have on a P300 speller while utilising low fidelity equipment
PY  - 2019
AB  - In this paper, we ensue on the development of a taxonomy aimed at categorizing distractions in the P300b domain. Explicitly, we investigate the effect that auditory distractions, distinctively that of ambient noise (AN), passive talking (PT), and active listening (AL) have on the signal of a visual P300 Speller in terms of accuracy, amplitude, latency, user preference, signal morphology, and overall signal quality. This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our results show that the accuracy was best for the Lab (LC) at 100%, followed by AN at 92.5%, PT at 90% and last AL at 87.5%, which results were in identical order to the subjects' preferences. In addition, the amplitude and latency did not show any statistical significance in all settings. This paper provides additional results that impart insight into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and low-cost equipment to be used in real-world applications. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - The effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using an early versus delayed postoperative rehabilitation protocol
PY  - 2015
AB  - Objective: To compare clinical results and tendon healing rates after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using a postoperative rehabilitation protocol with early passive motion compared with a delayed protocol that limited early passive motion. Method: The study enrolled 65 patients underwent arthroscopic repair of a medium or large full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Postoperatively, patients were randomized either to a rehabilitation program with early passive elevation and rotation or to an immobilization group with delayed training of range of motion. Changes in the simple shoulder test (SST), the Constant score, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and range of motion were assessed pre- operation, at 6 months and 12 months after surgery, and rotator cuff healing was assessed using MRI at 12 months after surgery. Result: There was no significant difference between groups at baseline. Both groups had similar improvements in preoperative to postoperative SST scores, the Constant score, VAS scores, range of active forward flexion and abduction-external rotation. There was no significant difference in range of active external rotation and rotator cuff healing between groups. Conclusion: Arthroscopic suture-bridge technique is an effective and reliable treatment for patients with medium and large full-thickness rotator cuff tears, post operative patients administered early or delayed rehabilitation protocol both demonstrated very similar outcomes and tendon healing rates within 1 year. The long-term outcomes remain to be determined. ©, 2015, China-Japan Friendship Hospital. All right reserved.

TI  - The effectiveness of corticosteroid injections compared with physiotherapeutic interventions for adhesive capsulitis: A systematic review
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objectives To determine the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections compared with physiotherapeutic interventions for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis/frozen shoulder.Data sources The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED were searched up to Week 23 2009. Additional database searching included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the National Research Register and the National Recognition Information Centre, also up to Week 23 2009.Review methods All English-language studies were eligible for inclusion if they showed evidence of random allocation of subjects to either a corticosteroid injection group or a physiotherapeutic intervention group. Studies were considered for inclusion if participants had a stated diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis/frozen shoulder or restriction of passive or active movement in two or more planes. The primary outcomes of interest were pain, external rotation and shoulder disability/function. Quality assessment was assessed using the PEDro scale. Standardised mean differences and effect estimates were calculated for the outcomes of pain, external rotation and shoulder disability at various follow-up periods.Results Six studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the final review. All had evidence of random allocation to either an injection group or a physiotherapeutic intervention group. There were son-le differences between the studies with regard to both the corticosteroid injections and physiotherapeutic interventions. Standardised mean differences and effect estimates were calculated for three of the included studies at various follow-up periods. There was a medium effect for corticosteroid injections compared with physiotherapeutic interventions for the outcomes of pain, passive external rotation and shoulder disability at 6 weeks. There was only a small effect in favour of corticosteroid injections for pain, passive external rotation and shoulder disability at 12 to 16 weeks and 26 weeks, and pain and shoulder disability at 52 weeks.Conclusion The results of this review suggest that corticosteroid injections have greater effect in the short term compared with physiotherapeutic interventions. This decreased over time, with only a small effect in favour of injections in the longer term. The results of this review must be interpreted with some caution due to the limited number of studies and differences in the interventions between the studies.

TI  - The effectiveness of proprioceptive training for improving motor function: a systematic review.
PY  - 2014
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Numerous reports advocate that training of the proprioceptive sense is a viable behavioral therapy for improving impaired motor function. However, there is little agreement of what constitutes proprioceptive training and how effective it is. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the available literature in order to provide clarity to the notion of training the proprioceptive system.METHODS: Four major scientific databases were searched. The following criteria were subsequently applied: (1) A quantified pre- and post-treatment measure of proprioceptive function. (2) An intervention or training program believed to influence or enhance proprioceptive function. (3) Contained at least one form of treatment or outcome measure that is indicative of somatosensory function. From a total of 1284 articles, 51 studies fulfilled all criteria and were selected for further review.RESULTS: Overall, proprioceptive training resulted in an average improvement of 52% across all outcome measures. Applying muscle vibration above 30 Hz for longer durations (i.e., min vs. s) induced outcome improvements of up to 60%. Joint position and target reaching training consistently enhanced joint position sense (up to 109%) showing an average improvement of 48%. Cortical stroke was the most studied disease entity but no clear evidence indicated that proprioceptive training is differentially beneficial across the reported diseases.CONCLUSIONS: There is converging evidence that proprioceptive training can yield meaningful improvements in somatosensory and sensorimotor function. However, there is a clear need for further work. Those forms of training utilizing both passive and active movements with and without visual feedback tended to be most beneficial. There is also initial evidence suggesting that proprioceptive training induces cortical reorganization, reinforcing the notion that proprioceptive training is a viable method for improving sensorimotor function.

TI  - The effectiveness of tactical communication and protection systems (TCAPS) on minimizing hearing hazard and maintaining auditory situational awareness
PY  - 2019
AB  - In military environments, maintaining Auditory Situational Awareness (ASA) and providing protection from hearing hazard are often dueling priorities. Traditional passive hearing protection devices (HPD’s) can provide adequate protection to the soldier from impulsive and continuous noise hazards, but this can come at the cost of reduced ASA. Anecdotal reports indicate that many soldiers may forego HPD use entirely in an attempt to maximize ASA. However, unprotected ears can lead to temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and permanent threshold shifts (PTS) that can be much worse for ASA than HPD use. Tactical Communication and Hearing Protection Systems (TCAPS) are active electronic systems that can provide a potential solution to this problem by giving the soldier protection, environmental hearing and radio communications. This paper discusses evaluating the effectiveness of these systems through objective measures of attenuation and subject human sound localization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature (outside the USA) 2019.

TI  - The effects of 3D interactive animated graphics on student learning and attitudes in computer-based instruction.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Visuals are most extensively used as instructional tools in education to present spatially-based information. Recent computer technology allows the generation of 3D animated visuals to extend the presentation in computer-based instruction. Animated visuals in 3D representation not only possess motivational value that promotes positive attitudes toward instruction but also facilitate learning when the subject matter requires dynamic motion and 3D visual cue. In this study, three questions are explored: (1) how 3D graphics affects student learning and attitude, in comparison with 2D graphics; (2) how animated graphics affects student learning and attitude, in comparison with static graphics; and (3) whether the use of 3D graphics, when they are supported by interactive animation, is the most effective visual cues to improve learning and to develop positive attitudes.  A total of 145 eighth-grade students participated in a 2 x 2 factorial design study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of four computer-based instructions: 2D static; 2D animated; 3D static; and 3D animated. The results indicated that: (1) Students in the 3D graphic condition exhibited more positive attitudes toward instruction than those in the 2D graphic condition. No group differences were found between the posttest score of 3D graphic condition and that of 2D graphic condition. However, students in the 3D graphic condition took less time for information retrieval on posttest than those in the 2D graphic condition. (2) Students in the animated graphic condition exhibited slightly more positive attitudes toward instruction than those in the static graphic condition. No group differences were found between the posttest score of animated graphic condition and that of static graphic condition. However, students in the animated graphic condition took less time for information retrieval on posttest than those in the static graphic condition. (3) Students in the 3D animated graphic condition exhibited more positive attitudes toward instruction than those in other treatment conditions (2D static, 2D animated, and 3D static conditions). No group differences were found in the posttest scores among four treatment conditions. However, students in the 3D animated condition took less time for information retrieval on posttest than those in other treatment conditions.

TI  - The effects of active and passive processing of apparent motion perception on visual evoked potential
PY  - 1999
AB  - Investigated the effects of active and passive processing of apparent motion perception on visual evoked potential (EP) (VEP). Two experiments were conducted in which point-light walkers were presented intermittently at the rate of 3 Hz as stimuli. The point-light walker was composed of only 10 point-lights representing the main joints of a human walker, and in intermittent presentation apparent motion of those point-lights was perceived. Ss in Exp 1 and 2 were 5 male and 3 female undergraduate and graduate students (mean age 23.8 yrs) with normal visual acuity in Japan. In Exp 1, Ss discriminated between 4 stimuli, which were forward walk (FW), backward walk (BW), random walk (RW) and static sequence (SS), so that active processing was examined. In Exp 2, passive processing and task loads were examined by using RW and SS. In both experiments, 5 VEP components were found for motion stimuli (FW, BW, RW), N60, P120, N185, P210 and N280. Both results show that N60 and P210 reflected active motion perception such as tracking of point-lights, and that N280 reflected both passive motion perception and task loads.

TI  - The effects of botulinum toxin type A on improvement and dynamic spastic equinus correction in children with cerebral palsy - Preliminary results
PY  - 2014
AB  - Introduction: We evaluated the effects of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) with physical therapy on dynamic foot equinus correction and higher motor functional outcome in children with spastic type of cerebral palsy (CP). Material and methods: Ankle joint active and passive movement, gastrocnemial muscle spasticity levels (Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)), and higher motor functional status (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) (GMFM-D - standing and GMFM-E - walking) were assessed before treatment and 3, 8, 16 weeks and 6 months after BTA administration in 12 children. Results: There was a significant improvement of active (initial - (-)13.07 ±5.78; 6 months - (-)10.64 ±4.77; p < 0.001) and passive (initial - 4.21 ±2.29; 6 months - 4.71 ±2.16; p < 0.05) ankle joint foot dorsiflexion. GMFM-D and GMFM-E were significantly higher after 3, 8, 16 weeks (p < 0.001) and GMFM-D after 6 months (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Botulinum toxin type A administration and physical therapy in patients with spastic CP improves the motion range of dynamic foot equinus after 3 weeks and higher motor functional outcome (standing and walking).

TI  - The effects of continuous passive motion on outcome in total knee arthroplasty
PY  - 2006
AB  - Continuous passive motion (CPM) is widely used in postoperative rehabilitation of total knee arthroplasty. However, the available literature reveals no consensus on the efficacy of this modality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CPM after total knee arthroplasty. Twenty-eight patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for primary knee osteoarthritis were randomized into two groups. One group received CPM plus physiotherapy (CPM group) whereas the other one received only physiotherapy (control group). Both groups underwent an identical physiotherapy protocol starting on the first postoperative day. In addition, the CPM group received CPM for 5 hours/day during the first postoperative week. CPM was initiated at a range of 0 to 40° on the first postoperative day and the amount of flexion was increased by 10° each day. Patients were assessed preoperatively, at discharge, at sixth week and sixth month. There were no significant differences regarding active range of motion, pain at rest and during activity, and knee swelling at discharge between the two groups. Hospitalization times were also similar. Active range of motion, pain scores, and American Knee Society knee and function scores were not significantly different at the sixth month, either. The use of CPM for 5 hours/day during the first postoperative week in addition to a standard physiotherapy regimen after total knee replacement had no advantage in the parameters evaluated.

TI  - The effects of distant and on-line visual information on the control of approach phase and step over an obstacle during locomotion
PY  - 2004
AB  - One of the goals of this study was to examine the nature and role of distant visual information sampled during locomotion in the feedforward control of leading and trailing limb while an individual is required to step over an obstacle in the travel path. In addition we were interested in whether or not on-line visual information available while the limb (lead or trail) is stepping over the obstacle influences limb trajectory control and whether the information provided during lead limb cross would be used to calibrate movement of the trail limb. Towards this end, we manipulated availability of vision following an initial dynamic sampling period during the approach phase in proximity to the obstacle and during the lead and trail limb stepping over the obstacle. Ten participants completed 40 trials of obstacle crossing in 8 testing conditions. Initial dynamic visual sampling was sufficient to ensure successful task performance in the absence of vision in the approach phase and during both lead and trail limb stepping over the obstacle. Despite successful task performance, foot placement of the lead and trail limb before obstacle crossing and limb elevation over the obstacle were increased after withdrawal of vision in the approach area. Furthermore, the correlation between toe clearance and foot placement was diminished. While both limbs require feedforward visual information to control the step over the obstacle, only lead limb elevation was influenced by availability of on-line visual information during obstacle crossing. Results were in agreement with the notion of primacy of information inherent in the optic array over those from static samples of the environment in guiding locomotion. It is suggested that the expected proprioceptive feedback information associated with the limb posture before the obstacle, reconstructed using visual memory from dynamic sampling of the environment, mismatched with those from the actual limb position. Accordingly, participants adopted a different strategy that enabled them to clear the obstacle with a higher safety margin.

TI  - The effects of dynamic faces on the perception of emotional expressions.
PY  - 2010
AB  - A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the effects of dynamic facial expressions on judgments of emotion. The effects of contextual cues on emotional expression evaluation have been studied before, usually by pairing a situational description with a facial expression or presenting two contrasting facial expressions. Here, context was manipulated by creating dynamic faces, faces that morphed from one emotional expression to another. In this way, the effects of a preceding video clip on the interpretation of an emotional facial expression could be evaluated. Results showed that dynamic facial expressions provided a salient contextual cue. The valence of neutral expressions was interpreted differently depending on the video clip preceding the expression. A neutral face at the end of an angry to neutral morph was rated positively whereas a neutral face at the end of a happy to neutral morph was rated negatively (Experiment 1A). The strength of this effect depended on the dynamic movement since bias effects were attenuated when the dynamic faces were replaced with static faces (Experiment 1B). Similar bias effects were observed for neutral faces and faces that were 25% emotive, but strongly emotional expressions were not susceptible to bias effects (Experiment 2). Different negative emotional expressions (angry vs. sad) had comparable effects on the subsequent judgment of a neutral face (Experiment 3). The duration of the dynamic video clips subtly modulated bias effects with longer durations leading to larger biases (Experiment 4). The degree to which static emotional faces affected expression judgment was manipulated by varying the exposure duration of the starting face and the delay between the starting face and the ending face (Experiment 5). These findings are similar to those from previous research exploring the effects of context on emotional facial expressions and bear some resemblance to representational momentum and face aftereffects. Dynamic faces provided a new way to study the effect of context on emotional expression perception and emphasize the importance of considering both spatial and temporal contextual influences.

TI  - The effects of dynamic movement on seated reach arcs
PY  - 2008
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between movement of the low back and shoulder during a normal seated reach and the reach arc estimation equations found in literature. The method consisted of evaluating individuals who were reaching with their right hands for five chess pawns, which were placed at varying distances. Specifically, the pawns were evenly spaced in a straight line directly in front of each participant's shoulder. This study focused on a group of 32 participants, which included both males and females. For each participant, low back, elbow and two shoulder angles were collected using a PEAK motion capture 6.0 system. Angles were collected in both the sagittal and transverse planes to gain a 3-D perspective. Data were summarised and correlated against maximum reach arc estimates. Results from the data suggest that both the shoulder and low back are engaged much earlier in a person's reach cycle than previously believed. Specifically, the results show low back engagement (trunk/lumber flexion) as early as 50% of maximum reach with the angle increasing to 5 degrees at around 80% and 10 degrees at 93%, which allows more pronounced forward angular acceleration. This shifts the shape and effective area of a participant's reach arc to a `dynamic' state and questions if major muscle recruitment in the torso has initiated. The resulting effect is that dynamic and static reach arcs may vary significantly. While this study is too limited to support formal conclusions, these results strongly suggest a need for further investigation into the limits and impact of dynamic reach.

TI  - The effects of electrical stimulation combined with continuous passive motion versus isometric exercise on symptoms, functional capacity, quality of life and balance in knee osteoarthritis: randomized clinical trial
PY  - 2011
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of electrical stimulation combined with continuous passive motion (CPM-ES) versus isometric exercise on symptoms, functional capacity, quality of life, muscle strength, knee and thigh circle measurements, and balance in knee osteoarthritis (OA). This is a randomized clinical trial. The study was done in Gulhane Military Medical Academy (GMMA) Rehabilitation Center. Forty patients with knee OA were included in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 20 patients placed in Group 1 were treated with conventional physical therapy and CPM-ES combination; 20 patients in Group 2 were treated with conventional physical therapy and isometric exercise. Therapies were applied 3 weeks, 5 days per week. The following main outcome measures were done: values of pain (VAS was used), WOMAC, SF-36, knee and thigh circle measurements, isokinetic tests, dynamic and static balance tests were determined at baseline and after the treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in the tested variables between the groups for post-treatment values. Dynamic and static balance test improved statistically strongly significantly in both groups. The findings of this study demonstrate that knee OA patients could improve their balance function in both static and dynamic conditions after CPM-ES combination or isometric exercise therapy. The improvement might prevent knee OA patients from falling down and increase their sense of security during physical activities.

TI  - The effects of muscle vibration in spasticity, rigidity, and cerebellar disorders
PY  - 1968
AB  - Ss were 75 patients with upper motor neuron lesions, 10 with Parkinsonism, and 5 with cerebellar syndromes. The motor effects of high frequency mechanical muscle vibration (about 150 Hz.) was studied during (1) rest and relaxation, (2) voluntary attempts to activate the muscles and to perform alternating movements, and (3) passive movements performed to test muscle resistance to imposed stretch. Results show that both strength and the time course of the vibration reflex may be different in spastic as compared with normal muscles. Another common finding in spastic patients is that vibration potentiates or reduces voluntary power (and range of movement) depending upon whether the S tries to contract the muscle vibrated or its antagonist. The potentiating effect upon active range of movement partly depends upon a vibration-induced reciprocal inhibition of the spastic resistance in the antagonists. Cocontractions in antagonists and other abnormal vibration reflex patterns were observed in some of the spastic patients. In parkinsonian Ss the vibration reflexes are often of normal strength but vibration increases the tremor and it may also impair the patient's ability to perform alternating movements. A similar vibration-induced disability to perform fast alternating movements was observed also in Ss with cerebellar disorders, where the vibration reflexes (as tested during rest) were either of normal strength or reduced. Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of muscle vibration are discussed. (26 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The effects of muscular fatigue on shoulder proprioception
PY  - 1998
AB  - Objective: To assess the influence of muscular fatigue on active and passive shoulder proprioception within the midrange of rotation.Design: A randomized controlled, before-and-after design.Setting: Neuromuscular research laboratory.Participants: Twenty recreationally active men (mean age, 23.81 +/- 2.77 years) were randomly assigned to either a control or a fatigue group. Exclusion criteria were any history of upper extremity injury or pathology, cardiovascular disease, or disease affecting the sensory system.Intervention: Shoulder proprioception was assessed by active reproduction of passive positioning (ARPP), active reproduction of active positioning (ARAP), reproduction of passive positioning (RPP), and threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM). For each test direction, the experimental group performed two bouts of maximal reciprocal concentric isokinetic internal and external contractions at 180 degrees/s until peak torque decreased to 50% of the established maximum voluntary contraction. After two bouts of the fatigue protocol, subjects were randomly assessed for proprioception into internal or external rotation.Main Outcome Measures: The absolute angular error for active and passive proprioception was measured on the Biodex System II Isokinetic Dynamometer (Biodex Medical Inc., Shirley, NY, U.S.A.) and a proprioception testing device, respectively.Main Results: A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance revealed no significant interactions between the experimental and control groups for ARPP, ARAP, RPP, or TTDPM.Conclusions: Shoulder proprioception was not affected by the short-duration, high-intensity protocol used in this study. This may be due to the lack of an extended recovery period observed with this type of fatigue regimen.

TI  - The effects of passive familiarization on neural and behavioral discrimination of acoustic signals
PY  - 2018
AB  - Organisms encounter numerous novel sensory signals throughout life. Thus, sensory representations in the adult brain, set up during ontogeny through the interaction of early experience with innate organizational principles, must undergo dynamic changes to adapt to the complexity of the external world. This thesis investigates how passive exposure to novel sounds modifies neural representations to facilitate recognition and discrimination, using the zebra finch model organism. Zebra finches use complex, learned acoustic signals for social communication with many parallels to human speech. Furthermore, the neural responses in an auditory structure in the zebra finch brain, Caudal Medial Nidopallium (NCM), undergo a long-term form of adaptation with repeated stimulus presentation, providing an excellent substrate to probe the neural underpinnings of adaptive sensory representations. In Experiment 1, electrophysiological activity in NCM was recorded under passive listening conditions as novel natural vocalizations were familiarized through playback. Neural decoding of stimuli using the temporal profiles of both multi-unit and single-unit neural responses improved dramatically during the first few stimulus presentations. During subsequent encounters, these signals were successfully recognized after hearing fewer initial acoustic features. Remarkably, the accuracy of neural decoding was higher when different stimuli were heard in separate blocks compared to when they were presented randomly in a shuffled sequence. Experiment 2 supported and extended these findings by showing that the rapid gains in neural decoding of natural vocalizations with passive familiarization were long-lasting, maintained for 20 hours after the initial encounter. Experiment 3 investigated how the degree of acoustic similarity between sounds related to these rapid dynamic changes in stimulus representations, using synthesized vocalizations that vary parametrically along a single dimension. Single-unit responses demonstrated that rapid differentiation of the temporal profiles of neural responses to different signals were more pronounced for stimulus pairs that are acoustically less similar to each other, although these results were mixed for multi-unit responses. Finally, in Experiment 4, the effects of passive familiarization on subsequent behavioral discrimination of two acoustically similar synthesized vocalizations were investigated. Surprisingly, this experiment did not indicate an effect of pre-exposure on behavioral responses. Taken together, the experiments in this thesis provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which the nervous system dynamically modulates sensory representations to improve discrimination of novel complex signals over short and long time-scales. Similar mechanisms may also be engaged during processing of human speech signals, and thus may have potential translational relevance to elucidate the neural underpinnings of speech perception and comprehension difficulties.

TI  - The effects of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception
PY  - 2002
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception.Design and Setting: In a research unit, 3 proprioceptive tests were performed. For each of the tests, a standardized patellar taping technique was applied in random order.Subjects: Fifty-two healthy volunteers (27 women, 25 men; age, 23.2 +/- 4.6 years; body mass index, 23.3 +/- 3.7).Measurements: We measured active angle reproduction, passive angle reproduction, and threshold to detection of passive movement on an isokinetic dynamometer. Results: We found no significant differences between the tape and no-tape conditions in any of the 3 proprioceptive tests (P > .05). However, when the subjects' results for active angle reproduction and passive angle reproduction were graded as good (less than or equal to5degrees) and poor (>5degrees), taping was found to improve significantly those with poor proprioceptive ability (P < .01).Conclusions: Subjects with good proprioception did not benefit from patellar taping. However, in those healthy subjects with poor proprioceptive ability as measured by active and passive ankle reproduction, patellar taping provided proprioceptive enhancement. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of patellar taping on the proprioceptive status of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

TI  - The effects of seismic airgun arrays on the acoustic behaviour and distribution of sperm whales and other cetaceans in the Northeast Atlantic / Atlantic Frontier
PY  - 1998
AB  - The use of high-energy seismic sound by the petroleum and geophysics industries (seismic) and recent documented examples of disturbance in marine mammals associated with their use have highlighted the need to study in detail their effects on marine mammal populations. The Atlantic Frontier (AF), the waters along the UK's Atlantic margin including the continental shelf, slope and pelagic waters, is recognised as being important for at least 22 species of cetacean, several of which are listed as endangered in the IUCN Red Data Book. The AF has recently become the focus of some of the most intense seismic activity in the world today. Activity here has the potential to affect a wider range of species than in the North Sea, particularly deep diving cetaceans, e.g. the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Passive acoustic surveys for cetaceans were conducted over the Rockall Bank and Trough between latitudes 55°N & 57°N and longitudes 13°W & 15°W, before, during and after a 2D seismic survey. Surveys were conducted from the survey's guard vessel during the summer and autumn of 1997. Acoustic methods allowed round the clock monitoring, in conditions that typically reduce the effectiveness of visual surveys. Transects were designed to monitor the effects of seismic airgun arrays on the vocal behaviour and distribution of the sperm whale and other cetaceans. Transects perpendicular to the direction of the contours, and separated by 7.5Nmi were adopted for surveys before and after seismic activity. Requirements to monitor 1Nmi ahead of the seismic vessel dictated how transects were distributed during seismic surveys. Acoustic data (200Hz-22kHz) were collected at monitoring stations every 2 minutes (0.18Nmi) along transects from a stereo, towed hydrophone array. Data were scored for vocalisation type & strength, seismic activity and various forms of noise. During seismic surveys monitoring stations were classified as: Guns-On, periods when airguns were active, and Guns-Off described periods when airguns were inactive, e.g. turns, repairs and bad weather. For sperm whales, runs of positive stations were considered to be single independent encounters with a group of whales. An encounter with a new group was assumed when separated by an interval without detection >30 minutes. Encounter rates were compared before, during and after surveys, these were highest during the initial phases of seismic activity and during post surveys and appear to suggest that sperm whales were not excluded from the area by seismic activity. Encounter duration was longer during seismic surveys but this difference was not significant. Encounter rates varied with time, but were typically highest during seismic activity, suggesting that sperm whales were not excluded from the area by the survey. Changes in the vocal behaviour of delphinids were observed in response to seismic activity, the production of tonal sounds (whistles) decreased and the number of broadband impulsive sounds (clicks) increased. Detection rates at the start and end of lines, 60 minutes either side of guns-on (line start) and guns-off (line end) were compared using a matched pairs analysis. These were found not to be significantly different for sperm whale, pilot whales and delphinid species. The results, which reveal few if any affects of airgun noise on sperm whales, are surprising in light of the dramatic responses by sperm whale to distant airgun noise 4 reported in the literature. Possible explanations include; a history of seismic activity in the area over the last 30 years could have resulted in habituation, and or responses may have been occurring at scales to which this research was not sensitive. These results are discussed, as are their implications for future studies.

TI  - The effects of shoulder injury on kinaesthesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2015
AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for changes for proprioceptive variables consisting of movement and position sense in participants with glenohumeral musculoskeletal disorders. Five databases were searched until 13th August 2013. Methodological quality was assessed and meta-analyses were performed for active and passive joint reposition sense (AJPS and PJPS) and movement sense, determined with threshold to detection of passive motion (TTDPM). The search yielded 17 studies, four of which were classified as having high methodological quality, seven as moderate and six as low quality. For participants with post-traumatic glenohumeral instability, pooled findings indicate moderate evidence for higher TTDPM for involved shoulders compared to control groups and the contralateral uninvolved side, indicating decreased movement sense. For AJPS and PJPS there was moderate to limited evidence for significant increased errors for involved compared to uninvovled shoulders, but not when compared to the control groups. Limited evidence was found for decreased AJPS acuity for patients with chronic rotator cuff pain and for patients with unspecified shoulder pain compared to healthy controls. Movement sense is most likely to be impaired after shoulder injury involving post-traumatic instability when compared to the contralateral shoulder and to controls, while deficits for AJPS and PJPS are more likely to be evident compared to the contralateral shoulder in participants with glenohumeral musculoskeletal disorders.

TI  - The effects of six weeks of unloaded and loaded whole-body vibration training on arterial function and muscle strength in obese pre-menopausal women
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Obesity is an ongoing socio-economic worldwide epidemic and major modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which continues to be the main determinant of all-cause mortality.  A potential mechanism by which obesity associates with CVD is an increased stiffness of the arteries leading to a decreased vascular function and development of hypertension.  Moreover, muscle strength and mass are inversely related to arterial stiffness and obesity.  Although exercise training is a proficient intervention for treating CVD risk factors and increasing muscle strength/mass, the most effective intervention for decreasing arterial stiffness is still unclear.  Whole-body vibration training (WBVT) is a relatively novel exercise mode which requires static or dynamic movements on a vibrating platform and has similar adaptations in the skeletal muscle as resistance training (RT).  However, the effects of whole-body high intensity RT seem to be adverse, although controversial to arterial function in young healthy adults and middle-aged with prehypertension or hypertension.  WBVT is usually performed with leg exercises using the body weight (unloaded) as resistance to the exercise. However, the addition of an external load or resistance to WBVT (WBVT+EX) has shown beneficial adaptations in improving arterial function, bone mineral density, hormonal responses, and muscle strength/mass. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether WBVT+EX would induce greater benefits than unloaded WBVT on arterial function and muscle strength in young-overweight and obese (body mass index, BMI= 30.9 ± 0.7 kg/m2) women.  Methods: Twenty-two young (20 ± 1 yr) overweight/obese women were randomly assigned to a non-exercising overweight/obese control (O-CON), WBVT, or WBVT+EX for 6 weeks.  Thirteen lean women were assigned to a lean control (L-CON) group in order to compare them at baseline to the age-matched overweight/obese women.  Pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial blood pressure (BP), aortic BP, wave reflection, muscle strength, and body composition were measured before and after 6 weeks. Results: Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.  Data were presented as mean ± SE.  There were no significant time effects or group-by-time interactions for brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), brachial systolic BP (bSBP), brachial diastolic BP (bDBP), aortic diastolic BP (aDBP), augmentation index (AIx), augmentation pressure (AP), and transit time for the reflected wave (Tr).  cfPWV and aSBP decreased (P < 0.05) in the WBVT group while baPWV and aDBP decreased in the WBVT+EX.  There was a significant group-by time interaction (P < 0.01) for faPWV, aSBP, aortic mean arterial pressure (aMAP), and AIx adjusted at 75 bpm (AIx@75). In addition, group-by-time interaction was detected for P1 and P2 such that the reductions observed in the WBVT and WBVT+EX groups were significantly different (P < 0.05) from the O-CON group.  The WBVT and the WBVT+EX groups had significant increases in leg strength (P < 0.01) when compared to the O-CON group (group-by-time P < 0.01) while a time-effect (P < 0.01) was observed in the chest 1RM only in the WBVT+EX group.  Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect beneficial effects of WBVT+EX on arterial parameters, as shown by improvements in aortic BP, PWV, and wave reflection while still maintaining increases in muscle strength in young overweight/obese women.  Although unloaded WBVT seems to be an effective exercise modality to improve arterial function in obese postmenopausal women, it does not seem to be as efficient in young obese women.  This study suggests that, although WBVT had some positive effects on arterial function in young overweight/obese women, a more evident benefit on arterial function is observed after increasing the exercise intensity of WBVT through an external load progressed from 15 to 8 RM.  Future studies should focus on older populations with greater risk of cardiovascular and/or other chronic diseases that are associated with reduced muscle strength/mass.  WBVT+EX should be incorporated and recommended for young overweight/obese women in order to improve arterial function and prevent the loss in muscle mass related to weight loss.  Additional studies should also consider the use of WBVT+EX as an adjunct exercise modality in order to incorporate its use in clinical populations prone to physical disabilities due to sarcopenia and dynapenia.

TI  - The effects of stimulus intensity on the cognitive P3 evoked response
PY  - 2000
AB  - Short-term memory problems are a normal part of aging but they can also indicate early signs of dementing diseases such as Alzheimer's. The P3 cognitive evoked response is a technique thought to directly assess short-term memory function. However, it has not been shown to be sensitive to mild short-term memory disorders. The P3 procedure is not standardized and this lack of sensitivity can be attributed, in part, to stimulus related factors used to generate the response. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to investigate the effect of increasing stimulus intensity on the P3 response. Many clincial populations cannot be counted upon to actively listen during the P3 discrimination task. It was hypothesized that the alerting effects of high stimulus intensity would cause a passive listener to generate a P3 response that was identical to an active listener. High intensity stimuli increased the prevalence of the P3 response. Additionally, the P3 latency shortened and the P3 amplitude was increased using high level stimuli. However, the P3 response obtained during passive listening was significantly different from the P3 response during active listening in young adults from the general population. P3 responses obtained from these two listening strategies should not be compared, especially at low stimulus intensities. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to compare equal and unequal relative toneburst intensities on the P3 measures. Hearing loss is a common finding among clinical populations with memory problems and can make the oddball tone unequal in loudness to the standard tone. It was hypothesized that changes in the salience of the discrimination task resulting from changes in the relative loudness of the tone pairs would change the P3 measures. It was found that the P3 response were less prevalent and longer in latency when subjects listened passively and the tonebursts were unequally intense, a listening condition common for individuals with dementia and hearing loss. Since a significant finding among clinical populations on whom the P3 might be applied is a prolonged or absent response, it is very important that the discrimination task be done at high intensity levels with the tones equally loud. If comparison are to be made between groups, both groups should be using the same listening strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The effects of stimulus motion on contrast sensitivity: Dynamic sensitivity functions.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Static Visual Acuity (SVA) has been called into question for some time as a measure of overall visual system function and as a predictor of performance on real-life tasks requiring vision (i.e., operating an automobile). Specifically, it has been pointed out that the targets employed in most SVA testing (high contrast, stationary letters) are an insufficient analog to actual targets encountered in everyday activities, which are often in motion and/or of less-than-perfect contrast. In addition, the size-threshold methodology typically used to measure SVA is incongruent with current theories of a multi-channel visual system. Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and Contrast Sensitivity have been suggested as alternatives to SVA, but while each mitigates specific weaknesses of the SVA measure, neither addresses the shortcomings completely. Traditional DVA measures employ moving targets, but these targets are usually of perfect contrast and a size-threshold methodology is used to specify acuity levels. Contrast Sensitivity employs a contrast-threshold methodology and allows measurement of specific visual channels, but stationary targets are utilized. The present study combined the DVA and Contrast Sensitivity measures in an effort to retain the unique qualities of each while addressing their shortcomings, resulting in a more detailed picture of the human visual system and functioning than has yet been possible. By measuring contrast sensitivity to targets at a set of spatial frequencies spanning the human "window of visibility" and under conditions of motion representative of that encountered in everyday activities, it was hoped that a more powerful predictor of actual visual performance would be created. In addition, normative data was established for two separate age populations, in the hopes of learning more about specific changes that occur to the visual system during the aging process. Indeed, several effects and interactions among the three main variables (spatial frequency, velocity, age) were uncovered, which appears to indicate that the new test may provide more information about the visual system than DVA or contrast sensitivity by themselves. The ramifications of this effort to human factors and visual performance research are discussed along with recommendations for the continuation and application of this line of research.

TI  - The effects of temperature and time on thermal bond strength in tendons
PY  - 2001
AB  - Flexor tendon injuries are a common problem requiring sutured repair followed by early postoperative mobilisation. Results are better if active rather than passive flexion is allowed, however active movement increases the incidence of dehiscence. This has prompted examination of thermal bonding as a strategy for strengthening tendon repairs. Three experiments are described, using method and experimental design similar to those previously described. The strength of thermal bonds created between sections of bovine Achilles tendon at a range of temperatures and times was measured. Bonds were created by heating compressed sections in a water bath, Bond strength was measured on a tensiometer as load (N) and stress (N/mm(2) and N m kg (-1)) then calculated using measured cross-sectional area, weight and length. Results were in broad agreement with those previously described, showing peak bond strength in samples heated to 62 degreesC for 8 min (median 17.11 N/cm(2), SD 2.13). The effects of cooling to 0 degreesC for 10 min immediately after bonding was to increase median bond strength when compared with non-cooled samples bonded under similar conditions (non-cooled, 9.11 N/cm(2), SD 3.11; cooled, 11.96 N/cm(2), SD 2.93). Statistical analysis using a quadratic regression model showed a close correlation between experimental data and curves modelled to best fit the data. Peak values for thermal bonds created using the methods described approached and in some cases exceeded that reported for the epitendinous element of modified Kessler tendon repairs in human digital flexor tendons. If such bonds could be created in vivo, thermal bonding may have a role in augmenting the strength of tendon repairs. The methods described are impractical for a non-laboratory environment. A laser would seem the most attractive alternative source of heat energy.

TI  - The effects of the application of Dermasport® plus Solution Cryo® in physiotherapy
PY  - 2005
AB  - In France, simultaneous application of Dermasport® plus Solution Cryo® on damaged or inflamed joints has been recommended for many years to assist with rehabilitation treatments. This protocol required validation. Objectives: To evaluate the benefits provided by simultaneous application of Dermasport® plus Solution Cryo® with no other therapeutic intervention, on knee and ankle joints (injured or post-surgery) requiring rehabilitation. Evaluation was to be made with regards to pain, degree of joint mobility and measurement of joint circumference, measured between 0 min (T0) and 30 min (T30) of product application. Methods: The study was conducted by six independent physiotherapists specialising in sports injuries. The patients, of both sexes, presented with knee pain or ankle pathology of traumatic or post-operative origin, recent or old with inflammation. All patients were treated by simultaneous application of the two products at T0, according to a method of application recommended by the manufacturers (Phytodermie). Results: Thirty patients were included in the study; 21 men and 9 women with an average age of 32.9 ± 13.9 years, the majority of whom were sports persons (80%) and presenting with a Body Mass Index (BMI) equal to 22.8 ± 2.5. Of the patients, 18 (60%) were being treated for knee pathology and the 12 others (40%) for ankle pathology. The comparative assessment between T0 and T30 demonstrated a net reduction in pain (at rest and with active and passive movement) and joint circumference at T30 for both joints. Furthermore, there was an increase in degree of articular mobility in flexion and extension of the knee and in dorsal and plantar flexion of the ankle. Finally, the global impressions of both patients and therapists were homogenous (more than 80% for both joints) and in favour of the efficacy of the simultaneous application of these two products. Localised skin reactions consisted of redness disappearing after application. In two cases they were associated with a temporary sensation of cold. This study confirmed the positive effects of simultaneous application of Dermasport® plus Solution Cryo® on injured joints. After 30 min of application, we observed an analgesic effect, improved joint mobility and a reduction in oedema.

TI  - The effects of therapeutic exercise using PNF on the size of calcium deposits, pain self-awareness, and shoulder joint function in a calcific tendinitis patient: a case study.
PY  - 2017
AB  - [Purpose] The purpose of this case study was to identify the effects of independent and intensive therapeutic exercise using Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on the size of calcium deposits, pain self-awareness, and shoulder joint function in a patient with calcific tendonitis. [Subject and Methods] The subject was a 42-year-old female patient with calcific tendonitis and acute pain who had difficulty with active movement and problems with general function. The independent and intensive Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise was applied for 40 min twice a day five times a week for two weeks for a total of 20 times. An X-ray, the visual analog scale, a simple shoulder test, the Constant-Murley Scale, and passive range of motion was used to evaluate the patient's change. [Results] The size of the calcium deposit, the visual analog scale score, and the simple shoulder test score decreased. The Constant-Murley Scale score and the passive range of motion were increased. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggested that intensive and independent therapeutic short-term exercise without any other exercise reduced pain and produced positive effects in shoulder function in a patient with the calcific tendonitis, which could confirm the importance of therapeutic exercise in the treatment of calcific tendonitis.

TI  - The effects of transparent and opaque illiterate illusory contour occluders on the motion interpretation
PY  - 2007
AB  - Based on the theories of midlevel or medium-level vision, the information about visual surfaces can have critical effects on the motion interpretation. Many of the evidences have revealed to support this theoretical point. Following such aspect, the purpose of this study is to explore how the attributes of the surface affect the motion interpretation. The major focus is to test whether the illusory contour, instead of real contour, being the occluders can also have similar effect on the motion interpretation. In addition to this test, the study on how transparency of the occluding surfaces influence motion interpretation is also performed. The paradigm developed by McDermott, Weiss, and Adelson (2001) was used in the present study. In experiments one and two, two types of illusory contour were designed as occluders. The results showed that illusory contour occluders affect motion in a similar manner as that of real contour occluders. And the effect was smaller for the transparent illusory contour as compared to the opaque illusory contour. In the subsequent three experiments, we designed various types of contour and manipulated transparency by different methods for comparison. It was found that the smaller effect of transparent illusory contour, when compared to opaque illusory contour, could be replicated in all three experiments. However, in the condition of real contour, the effect of transparency was not shown. Also, manipulating the transparency by different methods showed different effects in these three experiments. The most stable effect was obtained in manipulating the figural configurations to induce transparency in the illusory contour. Transparency induced by dynamic motion cue only showed a minor effect. Manipulating transparency by static binocular depth did not show any significant effect. From the results of all five experiments, the important role of the surface formation in motion processing which was predicted by the midlevel or medium-level vision theories was partially confirmed. On the other hand, not to be covered by these theories, that transparency of the surface can influence motion interpretation only in some of the conditions was observed in this study. Further research will be needed to reveal more details of the issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

TI  - The effects of visual information on postural stability in dynamic motion environments
PY  - 2003
AB  - It is apparent that visual information is used in maintaining stable posture in a stationary world. Considerable previous research has indicated that significant perturbations of posture can be induced with a shift in the entire visual scene. When standing or walking on moving platforms, it is assumed that posture and ambulatory ability are controlled more by vestibulo-spinal reflexes, but the role of visual reference has not been extensively studied. In the present study, we measured force plate recordings while subjects stood on a moving platform and derived the frequencies of motion-induced interruptions (MIIs) under two conditions. In the first condition a view of the stationary world within which the motion occurred was provided. In the second it was not. Subjects were tested on a motion platform driven by simulated ship-motion profile. In condition 1, subjects were allowed to see the walls and ceiling of the stationary test cubicle that housed the motion platform. In condition 2, curtains attached to the motion platform precluded this view. Significantly more MIIs (defined by differences in force plate recordings for the left and right feet) were found under the condition involving curtains. These results suggest that the visual input to postural stability in motion environments is more important than previously assumed. This suggests that manipulations (e.g. artificial horizons) that provide stable visual representations of the static environment within which the motion occurs may provide important health and safety measures for individuals working in enclosed environments on modern vehicular conveyances.

TI  - The effects of visual, verbal, and motor elaborations on preschool children's recall and comprehension of prose
PY  - 1986
AB  - This study examined the differential effect of dynamic (visual and motor) and static (visual and verbal) elaborations on preschool children's Immediate and delayed memory (recall of explicit content) and comprehension (recall of Implicit content) of prose. Eighty children, ages 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 years were randomly assigned to five treatment groups: 1) Read (R) condition ‐ unelaborated single reading of story; 2) Read‐Read (RR) condition ‐ two consecutive readings (static verbal elaboration); 3) Visual (S) condition ‐ story + observation of stationary representational props (static visual elaboration); 4) Experimenter‐Manipulate (E‐M) condition ‐ story + observation of experimenter manipulating props (dynamic visual elaboration); and 5) Subject‐Manipulate (S‐M) condition ‐ story + self manipulation of props (dynamic visual‐motor elaboration). As predicted, Ss In E‐M and S‐M conditions generally exhibited greater Immediate and delayed recall of both explicit and Implicit content than did Ss In the R condition. Unexpectedly, few differences were obtained between the dynamic and static conditions, or between the static RR and S conditions, although these results were obscured by age differences and question set Interactions. However, a relatively consistent trend was revealed In the data ‐ while dynamic visual‐motor elaborations enhanced both explicit and Implicit memory, static verbal elaborations generally enhanced only explicit recall. The superior recall of children In the E‐M and S‐M conditions was Interpreted as supporting the proposition that dynamic visual and motor elaborations of prose Induce Interactive Imagery In children as young as 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 years of age, and thereby enhance both their rote memory and constructive Inferential processing of information. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The effects of voluntary movements on auditory-haptic and haptic-haptic temporal order judgments
PY  - 2012
AB  - In two experiments we investigated the effects of voluntary movements on temporal haptic perception. Measures of sensitivity (JND) and temporal alignment (PSS) were obtained from temporal order judgments made on intermodal auditory-haptic (Experiment 1) or intramodal haptic (Experiment 2) stimulus pairs under three movement conditions. In the baseline, static condition, the arm of the participants remained stationary. In the passive condition, the arm was displaced by a servo-controlled motorized device. In the active condition, the participants moved voluntarily. The auditory stimulus was a short, 500 Hz tone presented over headphones and the haptic stimulus was a brief suprathreshold force pulse applied to the tip of the index finger orthogonally to the finger movement. Active movement did not significantly affect discrimination sensitivity on the auditory-haptic stimulus pairs, whereas it significantly improved sensitivity in the case of the haptic stimulus pair, demonstrating a key role for motor command information in temporal sensitivity in the haptic system. Points of subjective simultaneity were by-and-large coincident with physical simultaneity, with one striking exception in the passive condition with the auditory-haptic stimulus pair. In the latter case, the haptic stimulus had to be presented 45 ms before the auditory stimulus in order to obtain subjective simultaneity. A model is proposed to explain the discrimination performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The efficacy of adeli suit treatment in rehabilitation of post-stroke patients
PY  - 2016
AB  - Stroke occupies the second place between diseases with fatal results and also is the most prevailing reason of ability loss. Although the causes of stroke are well-known and it is possible to reduce these risks, there is still a need to improve rehabilitation techniques. Methods: The group that was chosen by us for investigation included 50 post-stroke patients (30 male, 20 female, age from 41 to 72 y.o.). 9 of them had hemorragic stroke and the others had ischemical stroke. In Adeli Medical Center (Piestany, Slovakia) the rehabilitation course of post-stroke patients were taken. For the purpose of rehabilitation we used Adeli suit treatment (AST) and traditional rehabilitation programs - massage, physiotherapy (TRP). Patients were matched by age and functional status and randomly assigned to the AST and TRP treatment groups. In the AST group (n=25, 15 males, 10 females, average age - 51,2 y.o.), 5 had hemorrhagic stroke, 20 had ischemical stroke). In the TRP group (n=25,15 males, 10 females, average age - 50,3 y.o.), 4 had hemorrhagic stroke, 21 had ischemical stroke. Both groups were treated for 2 weeks (2 hours daily,5 days per week, 10 sessions). Results: According to results of our investigation in group of patients, which took rehabilitation course by using Adeli suit treatment showed by 12% increase of volume active and passive movements and consequently decreasing severity of manifestations of paresis comparing with TRP group. Using the data evaluation on a Barthel scale was demonstrated on 10 points better result in AST group than in group that used TRP. Also during the study of somatosensory evoked potentials we have seen growth rates in AST group about 5% faster than in TRP. Conclusion: Adeli suit treatment is more efficient than traditional rehabilitation program. Benefits of using AST were demonstrated objectively using Barthel scale, goniometry and studies of somatosensory evoked potentials.

TI  - The efficacy of continuous passive motion in the rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions... including commentary by DeHaven KE with author response.
PY  - 1992
AB  - Seventy-five patients undergoing arthroscopically-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by the same surgeon were divided into three random subgroups. All of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions used the middle third of the ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft. Patients undergoing meniscal repair, extraarticular procedures, or repair of other ligaments were excluded. The 75 patients were divided into subgroups to assess the benefits or disadvantages of early active motion (25 patients), continuous passive motion (25 patients), and a combination of both (25 patients) during the first 30 days after surgery. All patients were evaluated at specific intervals for 6 months after surgery. Data recorded included drain output, medication usage, tourniquet time, leg involved, hospital stay length, KT-1000 testing (before surgery in the anesthetized patient, after the procedure was completed, and 2 and 6 months after surgery), and range of motion. Radiographs and the International Knee Evaluation Form were also used to evaluate the results. No statistically significant differences were found between the three groups. Side-to-side anterior-posterior differences, stability, and restoration of full range of motion were similar in each subgroup at each evaluated interval. In this prospective study of motion, started immediately after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, passive and active methods were shown to have identical results. A supervised active and passive motion program during the 1st month had the same results as either one used individually.

TI  - The efficacy of flurbiprofen versus piroxicam in the treatment of acute soft tissue rheumatism
PY  - 1984
AB  - Fifty patients suffering from acute soft tissue rheumatism entered an open parallel group study of flurbiprofen 200 mg to 400 mg daily versus piroxicam 20 mg to 40 mg daily for 4 weeks. Both treatments caused statistically significant improvements in pain, pain on active movement, restriction of passive movement and reduction of strength. Global assessments of the patients' progress also improved significantly with both compounds. Flurbiprofen was significantly superior to piroxicam with regard to relief of pain at Day 28, pain on active movement at Days 14 and 28, pain on passive movement at Days 7, 14 and 28 and pain, as measured by a visual analogue scale, at Day 14. Clinically, flurbiprofen showed greater improvements in all the other parameters throughout the study period. Side-effects, mainly gastro-intestinal in nature, occurred in 6 patients receiving flurbiprofen and 8 receiving piroxicam. One patient receiving flurbiprofen was withdrawn due to stomach pain and headache, but no withdrawals due to side-effects were necessary in those receiving piroxicam. One patient receiving piroxicam was withdrawn due to a total remission by Day 14. © 1984 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - The efficacy of the eyethinksport training software programon South African high school cricketers
PY  - 2009
AB  - The issue of enhancing an already superior visual system in elite athletes has led to several investigations dealing with intervention programmes designed to enhance visual performance. The influence of visual skills enhancement programmes has been investigated have reported that elite athletes, when compared to nonathletes, have superior visual abilities, measured through contrast sensitivity function, peripheral vision, visual reaction time, static visual acuity, eye movements, visual concentration, visual recognition and static/dynamic balance. Practical limitations, however, involves applicability to athletes. Where geographical location is considered, access to such training is a factor. A software programme, EyeThinkSport (Calder, 2006), was developed as an internet-based, self-administered intervention. Accessed through a personal computer with an internet link, the programme was designed to improve athlete's visual abilities and decision making. The aim of this investigation was to determine the efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme on selected cricket athletes at high school club level. Thirty high school level (aged 13 – 19) cricket players participated. Each player had at least 3 years of cricket playing experience. Participants were divided into 2 groups (E=15) and (C=15). Four phases of assessment were involved: (1) Series of preliminary visual assessments to establish testing protocol; (2) Pre-training programme assessment (pretest) using six different visual skills tests and five different cricket-specific skill tests (baseline data); (3) Three-week training programme using the EyeThinkSport software programme or a placebo; (4) Post training assessment (posttest) using 6 visual and 5 cricket-specific tests. All outcome variables were analyzed using a RM-ANOVA (group X time). Where significant interaction (p<0.05) effects were found, post-hoc analyses were performed (Tukey's HSD). In all tests involving visual skills, E performances showed greater improvement when compared to C performances. The efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme led to significant improvements in the performance of athletes in E in almost all visual skills. In contrast, there was minimal to moderate improvement in all tests with the exception of the horizontal and vertical saccades in C. It was confirmed that the EyeThinkSport visual training software programme is suitable to use in the enhancement of selected visual and sport-specific skills in high school cricketers.

TI  - The electrical characteristics of active sodium transport in the toad bladder.
PY  - 1963
AB  - The mechanism responsible for active sodium transport in the urinary bladder of the toad appears to be located at the serosal boundary of the epithelial cell layer of the bladder. Studies of the potential step observed at the serosal boundary in the open-circuited state were undertaken in an attempt to define the factors responsible for its production. Glass micropipettes were used to measure the serosal potential step in bladders exposed on the serosal side to solutions of high potassium or of high potassium and low chloride concentration. Observed potentials exceed the maximum values which would have been expected if the serosal potential step were a potassium or chloride diffusion potential. Measurements of net cation flux exclude the possibility of a diffusion potential at this border due to the passive movement of any anionic species. The observed independence of transbladder potential and short-circuit current from the pH of the serosal medium over a wide range of pH makes it unlikely that the observed serosal potential step is a hydrogen ion diffusion potential. We conclude that the active sodium transport mechanism in toad bladder is "electrogenic."

TI  - The encephalogram and electromyogram of motor conditioned reflexes after paralysis with curare
PY  - 1958
AB  - The author, like Liwanow, distinguishes three stages of bioelectric changes in the brain of a rabbit during the formation of a defensive motor conditioned reflex. He also separates a fourth stage, an already formed conditioned reflex, in which the rhythmic activity in the kinaesthetic analyzer disappears. A number of rabbits were subjected to the following procedures: 1. (a) Paralysis of the extremity with curare. 2. (b) Substitution of active with passive movements during the operation of the conditioned stimulus. 3. (c) The formation of conditioned motor reflexes after administration of pontocaine into the joint. In the light of these studies, the author discusses the factors underlying the appearance and disappearance of the driven rhythmic activity in the kinaesthetic analyzer (stages III and IV) and emphasizes the importance of proprioceptive stimuli for the formation of motor conditioned reflexes. © 1958.

TI  - The energy cost of level walking before and after hydro-kinesi therapy in patients with spastic paresis
PY  - 1998
AB  - In this study the energy cost of level walking was measured in 23 patients with stationary spastic paresis before and after a two-week treatment (45 min daily) of hydro-kinesi therapy, the latter consisting of passive and active movements in warm (32 degrees C) sea water, free swimming and water immersion walking. Among the subjects (80.2+/-13.2 kg body mass; 56.0+/-14.6 years of age; 10.7+/-6.6 years of duration of spasticity), 12 were affected by hemiparesis, 4 by multiple sclerosis and 7 by spinal cord injury. The energy cost of level walking (C-w) was measured before and after therapy from the ratio of the overall steady-state oxygen consumption to the effective speed of progression. The differences in C-w due to the treatment, at matched speeds, were found to be negligible at speeds higher than 0.75 m.s(-1) (less than 5%) but to increase, with decreasing speed, up to about 17% at 0.1 m.s(-1). The treatment was therefore effective in improving the gait characteristics of the subjects, through a decrease of their C-w, mainly at low speeds of progression.

TI  - The enhancement of periosteal chondrogenesis in organ culture by dynamic fluid pressure
PY  - 2001
AB  - Cartilage repair by autologous periosteal arthroplasty is enhanced by continuous passive motion (CPM) of the joint after transplantation of the periosteal graft. However, the mechanisms by which CPM stimulate chondrogenesis are unknown. Based on the observation that an oscillating intra-synovial pressure fluctuation has been reported to occur during CPM (0.6-10 kPa), it was hypothesized that the oscillating pressure experienced. by the periosteal graft as a result of CPM has a beneficial effect on the chondrogenic response of the graft. We have developed an in vitro model with which dynamic fluid pressures (DFP) that mimic those during CPM can be applied to periosteal explants while they are cultured in agarose gel suspension. In this study periosteal explants were treated with or without DFP during suspension culture in agarose, which is conducive to chondrogenesis. Different DFP application times (30 min, 4 h, 24 h/day) and pressure magnitudes (13, 103 kPa or stepwise 13 to 54 to 103 kPa) were compared for their effects on periosteal chondrogenesis. Low levels of DFP (13 kPa at 0.3 Hz) significantly enhanced chondro-genesis over controls (34 +/- 7% vs 14 +/- 5%; P < 0.05), while higher pressures (103 kPa at 0.3 Hz) completely inhibited chondrogenesis, as determined from the percentage of tissue that was determined to be cartilage by histomorphometry. Application of low levels of DFP to periosteal explants also resulted in significantly increased concentrations of Collagen Type II protein (43 +/- 8% vs 10 +/- 5%;P < 0.05). New proteoglycan synthesis, as measured by S-35-sulphate uptake was increased by 30% in periosteal explants stimulated with DFP (350 +/- 50 DPM vs 250 +/- 75 DPM of S-35-sulphate uptake/mug total protein), when compared to controls though this difference was not statistically significant. The DFP effect at low levels was dose-dependant for time of application as well, with 4 h/day stimulation causing significantly higher chondrogenesis than just 30 min/day (34 +/- 7 vs 12 +/- 4% cartilage; P < 0.05) and not significantly less than that obtained with 24 h/day of DFP (48 +/- 9% cartilage, P > 0.05). These observations may partially explain the beneficial effect on cartilage repair by CPM. They also validate an in vitro model permitting studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of action of mechanical factors regulating chondrogenesis. The fact that these tissues were successfully cultured in a mechanical environment for six weeks makes it possible to study the actions of mechanical factors on the entire chondrogenic pathway, from induction to maturation. Finally, these data support the theoretical predictions regarding the role of hydrostatic compression in fracture healing. (C) 2001 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - The exactness of hand movements in psychoneurotic children
PY  - 1935
AB  - The exactness of hand movements in static and dynamic muscular work has been tested in psychoneurotic children. The latter have been divided into the following groups: schizoid, cycloid and hysteroid neurotics, hysterical group, organic nervous diseases, and mentally defective children. Moede's tremometrical method was used. The static coordination of hand movements is very low in psychoneurotic groups as compared with normal children, whereas the dynamic coordination, as a regulation of active movements, gives better experimental results. The data obtained on psychoneurotics show a closer correspondence with normal coefficients than in organic diseases of the nervous system. Clinical treatment resulted in an increase of the exactness coefficients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The excursion of the median nerve during nerve gliding exercise: An observation with high-resolution ultrasonography
PY  - 2008
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the positioning of upper extremity and gliding distance of the median nerve during passive and active motion of the wrist and fingers. The longitudinal gliding of the medial nerve in the forearm was measured in 34 healthy subjects by ultrasonographic dynamic images. Those images were analyzed in a cross-correlation algorithm advocated by Dilley et al. (2001). In this experiment, passive extension of the wrist and fingers was applied manually by an examiner in four positions (elbow flexion and extension with forearm pronation, and elbow flexion and extension with forearm supination), two types of active finger motions (Hook and Grasp) were performed by the subjects. The distally oriented median nerve gliding ranged from 1.9 (in elbow extension with forearm pronation) to 3.0 mm (in elbow flexion with forearm supination) during passive extension of the wrist and fingers. There was a statistically significant difference in nerve gliding between the positions (p = 0.001). During active digital movement, the proximally oriented nerve gliding was observed from 0.8 (in the hook) to 1.3 mm (in the grasp). There was a significant difference in nerve gliding between the two ways of active finger motions (p = 0.001). On the basis of the data obtained from this study, it is concluded that forearm supination is the preferred position for the passive median nerve gliding exercise because of large distally oriented nerve gliding. The active digital motion with full finger grip may be an effective procedure to produce proximally oriented median nerve gliding.

TI  - The extrastriate cortex distinguishes between the consequences of one's own and others' behavior
PY  - 2007
AB  - The extrastriate body area (EBA) is traditionally considered a category-selective region for the visual processing of static images of the human body. Recent evidence challenges this view by showing motor-related modulations of EBA activity during self-generated movements. Here, we used functional MRI to investigate whether the EBA distinguishes self- from other-generated movements, a prerequisite for the sense of agency. Subjects performed joystick movements while the visual feedback was manipulated on half of the trials. The EBA was more active when the visual feedback was incongruent to the subjects' own executed movements. Furthermore, during correct feedback evaluation, the EBA showed enhanced functional connectivity to posterior parietal cortex, which has repeatedly been implicated in the detection of sensorimotor incongruence and the sense of agency. Our results suggest that the EBA represents the human body in a more integrative and dynamic manner, being able to detect an incongruence of internal body or action representations and external visual signals. In this way, the EBA might be able to support the disentangling of one's own behavior from another's. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The factors affecting stiffness occurring with rotator cuff tear
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Stiffness after a rotator cuff tear is common, and it affects postoperative prognosis. This study aims to define the factors affecting stiffness that accompanies rotator cuff tear.Materials and methods: From June 2002 to May 2009 (84 months), 143 patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Of these, 119 were enrolled as subjects in this study. Preoperative range of motion was measured in all patients. Stiffness of the shoulder was defined as restriction of active and passive motion of 100 degrees of elevation or less, less than 50% of external rotation, and internal rotation only to the sacrum. Factors that can affect stiffness were evaluated, including the type, size, and direction of rotator cuff; duration of symptoms; gender; age; presence of accompanying medical disease; degenerative factors (Goutallier classification); and presence of trauma. Retrospective analysis was conducted accordingly.Results: A statistically significantly higher degree of stiffness was seen for full-thickness tears than for partial-thickness tears (P = .0187). Between 2 groups that were divided by direction of rotator cuff tear, posterosuperior cuff tears showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of stiffness (P = .0415). Patients with trauma had a statistically higher prevalence of stiffness (P = .0264). The other factors did not show significant differences.Conclusion: In patients with rotator cuff tear, the type and direction of rotator cuff tear and the presence of trauma seem to increase the limitation of preoperative joint range of motion.Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.

TI  - The feasibility of a video-based motion analysis system in measuring the segmental movements between upper and lower cervical spine
PY  - 2007
AB  - The evaluation of the range of motion (ROM) and static posture in the cervical spine are important in physical examination. Despite offering dynamic assessment without radiation, the video-based motion analysis system has not yet been applied to measure the cervical segmental movements. The purposes of this study were to develop a neck model to differentiate the movements and posture between upper and lower cervical spine, and to examine the reliability of measuring cervical motion with surface markers and the aid of videofluoroscopy. Sixteen healthy adult subjects (eight males and eight females) participated in this study. Ten surface markers were used to estimate the discrepancies in cervical vertebral angles compared with corresponding bony landmarks throughout the ROM. The average intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the paired vertebral angles between surface markers and bony landmarks ranged from 0.844 to 0.975 and the mean absolute difference (MAD) averaged 2.96. Our results indicate high consistency between surface markers and bony landmarks throughout the cervical movements. The mean upper (CO-C2) and lower (C2-C7) cervical joint angles in the neutral position were 18.59 +/- 4.33 degrees and 23.98 +/- 6.15 degrees, respectively. Furthermore, the reliability of the digitizing procedure within raters (ICC = 0.850-0.999; MAD = 0.58-2.42) and between raters (ICC = 0.759-0.988; MAD = 0.59-2.66 degrees) suggests that the neck motion analysis model is a feasible method for investigating static neck posture or dynamic motion between upper and lower cervical spine.

TI  - The female ACL: why is it more prone to injury?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Multiple factors are responsible for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. The key factor in the gender discrepancy appears to be dynamic, not static, and proximal, not distal. However, it is the dynamic movement patterns of hip and knee position with increased flexion and a coordinated proximal muscle firing pattern to keep the body in a safe landing position that are the most critical factors. An ACL injury at an early age is a life-changing event. We can very successfully reconstruct and rehabilitate an ACL, but we cannot stop there. We must now go into the prevention arena.

TI  - The first autonomously controlled capsule robot for colon exploration
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Capsule technology has made exploration of the entire gastrointestinal tract possible. Currently available colon capsules are limited due to passive movement and lack of therapeutic capability. Our academic lab has created a novel capsule robot for colon exploration that is actively maneuvered by magnetic coupling with both diagnostic and therapeutic function. Owing to the high gradient of their fields, permanent magnets (PM) are challenging to control and therefore an external robotic arm and localization algorithm are employed that permit intelligent manipulation of the capsule with allowance for autonomization of difficult maneuvers. Retroflexion (Rflx) is a common but mechanically complex maneuver during colonoscopy and therefore serves as an excellent subject for autonomous control. Aim: To demonstrate efficient, reliable, and safe autonomous intelligent control of a capsule robot at the retroflexion maneuver. Methods: Platform: The capsule head is 18 mm and contains an internal PM. Magnetic force and torque are applied by an external PM manipulated by a robotic arm for teleoperated maneuverability. The capsule is introduced via the rectum and is soft-tethered, which allows for introduction of instruments, insufflation, irrigation, and suction. Software allows for real-time pose detection of the capsule relative to the external PM so that the robot can “think” autonomously for precise movement of the capsule in the colon. Experiment: The system was set to perform autonomous Rflx with a simple “push-of-a-button” in the colon of a 40 kg Yorkshire- Landrace swine in-vivo. A single endoscopist initially performed Rflx with a standard colonoscope at 15 cm from the anal sphincter. The system was then activated for intelligent autonomous Rflx at 15 cm from the anal sphincter. 30 total Rflx maneuvers were performed. Successful completion of Rflx, time to complete Rflx, and accuracy were recorded. Leak testing and pathologic examination were performed at necropsy. Results: Rflx was successfully completed with both the standard endoscope and the autonomously controlled capsule robot for every trial (100%). Time to successful maneuver under autonomous control was 12.0 ± 2.3 s. The capsule and robots trajectory varied for each trial owing to the system responding and autocorrecting, in real-time, to the capsule's movements. No leaks or histologic abnormalities were visualized on necropsy. Conclusions: This is the first time that a capsule robot has been autonomously controlled in-vivo in a reliable, efficient, and safe manner. The proprioceptive robotic system can autocorrect its maneuvers quickly. Active autonomous intelligent manipulation of a capsule robot is a breakthrough step toward artificially intelligent endoscopistdirected capsule colonoscopy. Studies evaluating additional control algorithms are currently underway.

TI  - The first impression in the urban sonic experience: transitions, attention, and attunement
PY  - 2018
AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the phenomenology of moments of transition between sonic environments in the urban context and conceptualize the role they play in the attunement of the body to urban spaces. It has been argued that transitions between different environments tend to be moments when sonic perception and feedback are enhanced and, as moments of interruption, they play a significant role in how we attune to urban places. Our study contributes to a greater understanding of these moments. We present the concept of sonic first impression to address the affective nuances of these moments, and the concept of sonic attunement to address how individuals tune in to urban places through sound. In order to explore how these concepts apply in practice, we have undertaken a participatory methodology with 12 volunteers, which included sound diaries and go-alongs. These methods allowed us to gather in-depth data about spatial and temporal transitions and issues related to the angle of arrival of the body. Our results unveil the role that sound plays in attunement to place, a role that encompasses both meaning and affect, active and passive hearing, consciousness and unconsciousness, mind and body, psychology and physiology.

TI  - The first prospective implementation of markerless lung tumor tracking on a standard linear accelerator
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose: The ability to track tumor motion without implanted markers on a standard linac will enable wide access to adaptive radiotherapy. This study presents the first prospective implementation of markerless tumor tracking (MTT) on a standard linac and its quality assurance (QA) procedure. Method(s): A QA procedure following the AAPM TG147 report was developed to measure static and dynamic localization accuracy and latency. A CIRS lung phantom was attached to the HexaMotion platform to emulate 3D motion from seven static and five dynamic motion traces that en-compass different types of lung tumor motion. For MTTa patient specific model was built from 4D treatment planning data. On the treatment day, a pre-treatment imaging arc was acquired to update for daily motion information. KV-projections were acquired during VMAT-treatment delivery. The model was exploited to find the projected tumor and an extended Kalman filter was used to infer the 3D tumor position. MTTwas implemented in the VMAT-treatment workflow using only clinical imaging protocols. The linac was operated in clinical mode, while a frame-grabber-software transmitted kV-projections to a dedicated laptop. The performance was accelerated using a GPU and the OpenCV package. Result(s): The prospective evaluation was successful. The mean tracking error was left-right (LR): 0.5 +/- 0.2 mm, superior-inferior (SI):-0.7 +/- 0.2 mm and anterior-posterior (AP):-0.0 +/- 0.3 mm for the static localization test, and LR:-0.2 +/- 1.5 mm, SI:-0.5 +/- 0.7 mm and AP:-0.3 +/- 0.9 mm for the dynamic localization test. The computational latency for each kV-projection was 108 +/- 8 ms. Conclusion(s): This study presents the first implementation of MTT on a standard linac. A QA procedure was developed to benchmark tracking accuracy and precision. This study paves the way for the first clinical use of MTT on a standard linac, which has the potential to enable real-time adaptive radiotherapy for a large population of cancer patients. Ethics have been submitted for related clinical trials.

PY  - 2003
AB  - The flash-lag effect results from displays in which a flashed object is physically co-localized with a moving object. Despite the alignment of the two objects, the observer perceives the flashed object as lagging behind the moving object. It is not known if analogous effects occur with respect to a moving body part, such as the observer's hand. Here we show that a flash presented in alignment with an invisible rod that the observer voluntarily moves, also appears to lag behind the felt position of the rod. Four observers moved a 220 gm rod in the dark while an LED was flashed at various positions relative to the rod. Observers reported whether they perceived the position of the flash as " ahead" "behind" or "centered" in relation to the rod. On average, a flash presented 125 ms in advance of the rod position was judged by observers as centered on the rod. In a second preliminary experiment, two new observers grasped a manipulandum. Glue on the manipulandum fixed the observer's hand in position without requiring the observer to exert any force. The invisible manipulandum (and the observer's hand) was then carried by a linear drive, while the flash was presented in various positions. In this "passive movement" condition, observers similarly judged the position of a flashed LED relative to the manipulandum. Once again a significant flash-lag effect was observed. These experiments show that a flash-lag effect occurs relative to the felt position of a limb, both when the limb is moved passively and actively. This suggests that compensation for neural delays in the registration of limb position occurs both when motor and sensory information for limb position is simultaneously available (active movement case), as well as when only sensory information is available (passive movement case).

TI  - The flight maintenance mechanism in the cockroach Periplaneta americana L.
PY  - 1984
AB  - 1. In order to find the receptors that maintained flight in the cockroach Periplaneta americana a wind tunnel was used (Fig. 1A). 2. After removal of the antennal flagella prolonged flight was not possible. However, sticking of cut antenna restored flight capability (Table 2a, b). These data showed that for maintenance of cockroach flight antennal flagella were needed as levers acting on pedicel receptors: chordotonal sensilla (including the chordotonal sensilla of Johnston's organ) and sensilla campaniformia. 3. In the laminar airstream passive antennal vibration caused by the wing motor activity was absent and the observed antennal movements in flight were evoked only by antennal muscle activity. Fixation of active antennal movements by immobilization the head-scapus and scapus-pedicel joints leads to cessation of flight. Therefore, pedicel receptors are capable to maintain the cockroach flight only if active antennal movements in the airstream are present. 4. The frequency of active antennal movements with amplitude of more than 1 mm is in the cause of 3-10 Hz (Fig. 3B). Each of these active movements like at instantaneous cessation of {Mathematical expression}1 and {Mathematical expression}1 antennal joints evoked lash (passive deflection) of its flagellum relatively to the pedicel. To estimate low-amplitude passive deflexions which are defined by high-amplitude active movements due to the inertia, 'sail-property' and weight of the flagellum a mathematical model was developed. This model describes the displacements of the cockroach flagellum which are evoked by the active movements in the airstream of different velocity. 5. The application of the constructed mathematical model showed that at active antennal movements in the air current velocity of 1.5-2 m/s (minimum velocity at which the cockroach flight was possible) the angle determined by the flagellum weight (its 'sagging') was compensated and the angle of flagellum displacement relative to the pedicel at the active movements upward was increased by 1.5-2 times as compared with the same angles at the same antennal movements in still air (Fig. 4). It seems clear that just the redistribution of the load on the pedicel receptors was that mechanical stimulus which periodically acting with frequency of active antennal movements of 3-10 Hz led to alterate the mosaic of excitation of differently located in pedicel chordotonal and campaniform sensilla (functional asymmetry of the system of pedicel receptors) and ultimate maintenance of prolonged flight. 6. Microelectrode recording of electrical activity of the pedicel sensilla showed that three functional types of receptors (phasic-tonic receptors with slow and incomplete adaptation, phasic-tonic receptors with fast and complete adaptation and phasic receptors) were revealed. These receptors perceived the changes in amplitude (starting from 20-30 μm), the frequency (up to 50 Hz, Fig. 6), the flagellum movement velocity as well as they had directional sensitivity. (The sector of the maximal sensitivity was 90-135° in most receptors.) Thus, redistribution of the load in flight from the ventral to dorsal side of the pedicel evoked electrical activity of a definite group of receptors. The sectors of maximal sensitivity of these receptors were dorsally orientated. 7. The pedicel mechanoreceptors' responses in the cockroach head ganglia went over into the descending interneurons of three functional types including the phasic-tonic type with slow incomplete adaptation, the phasic-tonic type with fast and complete adaptation and phasic interneurons. In the cockroach brain the chiasma of the nervous tracts provides receiving the information about the flagellum deflexion to the left and right sides of the prothoracic ganglia. Interneurons were not able to respond for a long time to flagellum vibration, if its frequency exceeded 10 Hz (Fig. 8). Thus, it was evident that electrical activity maintaining the cockroach flight consisted of the impulse bursts of the pedicel receptors and related interneurons at each deflection of the flagellum with regard to the pedicel at the active antennal movements in the air current. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.

The possibilities of clinical application are analysed by classical indications and results of controlexaminations.

TI  - The function of auditory neurons in cricket phonotaxis - II. Modulation of auditory responses during locomotion
PY  - 1988
AB  - The activity of auditory receptor cells and prothoracic auditory neurons of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, was recorded intracellularly while the animal walked on a sphere or while passive movement was imposed on a foreleg. During walking the responses to simulated calling song is altered since (i) the auditory sensory cells and interneurons discharged impulses in the absence of sound stimuli (Figs. 1, 3) and (ii) the number of action potentials in response to sound is reduced in interneurons (Figs. 2, 3). These two effects occurred in different phases of the leg movement during walking and therefore masked, suppressed or did not affect the responses to auditory stimuli (Figs. 3, 4). Hence there is a time window within which the calling song can be detected during walking (Fig. 5). The extra excitation of receptors and interneurons is probably produced by vibration of the tympanum because (i) the excitation occurred at the same time as the leg placement (Fig. 4), (ii) during walking on only middle and hindlegs, no extra action potentials were observed (Fig. 6), (iii) in certain phases of passive movements receptor cells and interneurons were excited as long as the ipsilateral ear was not blocked (Figs. 8, 9). Suppression of auditory responses seems to be peripheral as well as central in origin because (i) it occurred at particular phases during active and passive leg movements in receptor cells and interneurons (Figs. 1, 4, 9), (ii) it disappeared if the ear was blocked during passive leg movements (Fig. 9) and (iii) it persisted if the animal walked only on the middle and hind legs (Fig. 6). © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The functional anatomy of recovery from auditory agnosia - A PET study of sound categorization in a neurological patient and normal controls
PY  - 1995
AB  - (H2O)-O-15-PET was used to investigate the functional anatomy of recovery in a patient (J.B.) with bilateral perisylvian strokes and auditory agnosia, who partially regained the ability to recognize environmental sounds, but remained clinically word-deaf The patient and a group of six normal volunteers were scanned in the following three conditions: (i) passive listening to environmental sounds; (ii) categorization of environmental sounds; (iii) at rest In normal subjects, passive listening as compared with rest was associated with significant activations in the auditory cortices and posterior thalami, and in the inferior parietal lobe and anterior insula/frontal opercular region on the right. In J.B., activations were observed in the spared auditory cortex and inferior parietal lobe of the right hemisphere and in regions adjacent to the perisylvian lesion in the left hemisphere (anterior insula/frontal opercular region, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe). The recovered function, as measured by categorization of sounds compared with passive listening, in J.B. was associated with bilateral activation of a distributed network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices, as well as the right cerebellum and the right caudate nucleus. In addition, there was a left-sided activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus. In normal subjects, the same categorization task led to activation of a network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices in the left hemisphere only. These results suggest that bilateral activation (with recruitment of areas homologous to those known to be responsible for normal function), the engagement of peri-infarct regions, and the involvement of a more widespread neocortical network, are mechanisms of functional reorganization after injury that may enable recovery from, or compensation for cognitive deficits.

TI  - The functional neuroanatomy of musical memory in Alzheimer's disease
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Memory for music has attracted much recent interest in Alzheimer's disease but the underlying brain mechanisms have not been defined in patients directly. Here we addressed this issue in an Alzheimer's disease cohort using activation fMRI of two core musical memory systems.Methods: We studied 34 patients with younger onset Alzheimer's disease led either by episodic memory decline (typical Alzheimer's disease) or by visuospatial impairment (posterior cortical atrophy) in relation to 19 age-matched healthy individuals. We designed a novel fMRI paradigm based on passive listening to melodies that were either previously familiar or unfamiliar (musical semantic memory) and either presented singly or repeated (incidental musical episodic memory).Results: Both syndromic groups showed significant functional neuroanatomical alterations relative to the healthy control group. For musical semantic memory, disease-associated activation group differences were localised to right inferior frontal cortex (reduced activation in the group with memory-led Alzheimer's disease); while for incidental musical episodic memory, disease-associated activation group differences were localised to precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (abnormally enhanced activation in the syndromic groups). In post-scan behavioural testing, both patient groups had a deficit of musical episodic memory relative to healthy controls whereas musical semantic memory was unimpaired.Conclusions: Our findings define functional neuroanatomical substrates for the differential involvement of musical semantic and incidental episodic memory in major phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. The complex dynamic profile of brain activation group differences observed suggests that musical memory may be an informative probe of neural network function in Alzheimer's disease. These findings may guide the development of future musical interventions in dementia. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The functional range of motion of the finger joints
PY  - 2015
AB  - The purpose of this study was to measure the functional range of motion of the finger joints needed to perform activities of daily living. Using the Sollerman hand grip function test, 20 activities were assessed in ten volunteers. The active and passive range of motion was measured with a computerized electric goniometer. The position of each finger joint was evaluated in the pre-grasp and grasp positions. The functional range of motion was defined as the range required to perform 90% of the activities, utilizing the pre-grasp and grasp measurements. The functional range of motion was 19 degrees-71 degrees, 23 degrees-87 degrees, and 10 degrees-64 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints, respectively. This represents 48%, 59%, and 60% of the active motion of these joints, respectively. There was a significant difference in the functional range of motion between the joints of the fingers, with the ulnar digits having greater active and functional range. The functional range of motion is important for directing indications for surgery and rehabilitation, and assessing outcome of treatment.

TI  - The fundamental response of piezoelectric guided-wave sensors and applications to damage and impact location
PY  - 2006
AB  - PZT elements are now commonly used as wave actuators and sensors in guided-wave SHM applications. In order to optimize the monitoring system it is essential to understand the properties of the PZT-structure coupled motion. The present paper derives the general response of a PZT sensor to harmonic guided-waves on the basis of the theoretical expression of surface strains for the S-0 and A(0) fundamental Lamb modes. The PZT response to broadband excitation is computed semi-analytically and validated through experimental tests. The study shows the role of the PZT dimensions and angle of wave incidence on the frequency response characteristics of the sensor.The frequency response characteristics of a rectangular PZT sensor can be exploited in order to exhibit quantifiable directivity behavior over specific frequency ranges. Sensors with known directivity can be utilized in a passive Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring technique based upon strain gage rosette concepts adapted for piezoelectric transducers. Such an approach can be used to locate impacts or active damage without knowledge of the wave velocity in the structure. This approach is particularly attractive for composite panels in aerospace structures, where conventional time-of-flight based AE location would require complicated optimization or iterative algorithms for the triangulation. Experimental tests are conducted to validate this technique.

TI  - The gait switch and control on reconfigurable exploration robot
PY  - 2013
AB  - A set of gaits on the reconfigurable exploration robot are developed to switch and control when being applied for very irregular and otherwise impassable terrain in planet. The digital prototype of a reconfigurable robot with 12-tetrahedral elements has been built, and 3 kinds of gait modes, rolling, walking and climbing, are presented regarding to flat road, uneven surface and narrow cliff, respectively. Based on the information of vision sensors, the rule of gait switch is put forward as well as the control strategy. The stability criteria of the mobile robot with regard to quasi-static and dynamic movement are also proposed immediately after the gait planning. By means of the kinematics and dynamics simulation of the 12-tetrahedron robot, the stability criteria used to build the gait modes have been validated, which are useful to test the exploration capability of the robot in extreme environment, and may provide the effective reference to the system design.

TI  - The good, the bad and the ugly of spinal cord injury spasticity: Towards a better diagnosis and targeted treatment strategy
PY  - 2013
AB  - Spasticity is an important sensorimotor disorder that affects between 65-78% of people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Although the standard diagnosis of spasticity relies on the standard measurement of hypertonia and stretch hyperreflexia, these symptoms are often described by patients as beneficial and may only play a limited role in motor dysfunction. In contrast related spasticity signs, such as involuntary muscle contractions (spasms) and cutaneous long-latency hyperreflexia, may be more problematic for residual motor function and general daily activities. As such there is a real need to characterize the impact of the symptoms of spasticity on neurological, functional, and daily activity during SCI rehabilitation. In this lecture the diagnostic utility of cutaneous hyperreflexia during both active and passive movement, as a possible hallmark of SCI spasticity will be discussed, in addition to its tractability to novel pharmacological and sensory neurorehabilitative strategies designed to modulate this specific sign of motor dysfunction.

TI  - The hands have it: Hand specific vision of touch enhances touch perception and somatosensory evoked potential
PY  - 2012
AB  - Our ability to accurately discriminate information from one sensory modality is often influenced by information from the other senses. Previous research indicates that tactile perception on the hand may be enhanced if participants look at a hand (compared to a neutral object) and if visual information about the origin of touch conveys temporal and/or spatial congruency. The current experiment further assessed the effects of non-informative vision on tactile perception. Participants made speeded discrimination responses (digit 2 or digit 5 of their right hand) to supra-threshold electro-cutaneous stimulation while viewing a video showing a pointer, in a static position or moving (dynamic), towards the same or different digit of a hand or to the corresponding spatial location on a non-corporeal object (engine). Therefore, besides manipulating whether a visual contact was spatially congruent to the simultaneously felt touch, we also manipulated the nature of the recipient object (hand vs . engine). Behaviourally, the temporal cues provided by the dynamic visual information about an upcoming touch decreased reaction times. Additionally, a greater enhancement in tactile discrimination was present when participants viewed a spatially congruent contact compared to a spatially incongruent contact. Most importantly, this visually driven improvement was greater for the view-hand condition compared to the view-object condition. Spatially-congruent, hand-specific visual events also produced the greatest amplitude in the P50 somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). We conclude that tactile perception is enhanced when vision provides non-predictive spatio-temporal cues and that these effects are specifically enhanced when viewing a hand.

TI  - The hippocampus and exploration: dynamically evolving behavior and neural representations
PY  - 2012
AB  - We develop a normative statistical approach to exploratory behavior called information foraging. Information foraging highlights the specific processes that contribute to achieve, rather than passive, exploration and learning. We hypothesize that the hippocampus plays a critical role in active exploration through directed information foraging by supporting a set of processes, we show how information directed information foraging provides a formal theoretical explanation for the common hippocampal substrates of constructive memory, vicarious trial and error behavior, schema-based facilitation of memory performance, and memory consolidation.

TI  - The homodigital neurovascular antegrade island flap for fingertip reconstruction in children
PY  - 2011
AB  - We describe a homodigital neurovascular island flap for fingertip reconstruction in children and review the appearance and function of the reconstructed fingertips.Eleven children, with a mean age of 4 years (range : 2-7),who had sustained a fingertip injury with total or subtotal pulp loss were treated with a homodigital neurovascular island flap between 2007 and 2009. The flaps were harvested based on a single digital neurovascular bundle without further shortening of the distal phalanx. The average follow-up period was 15 months (range : 10-32 months). The clinical outcome evaluations included the defect size of the flap, the static two-point discrimination, total active motion (TAM) of the PIP and DIP joints and time to return to daily activities. Patient satisfaction with function and cosmesis were also evaluated.All of the flaps survived without any painful scar formation, hypersensitivity or cold intolerance and no interphalangeal joint contractures were noted. The average two point discrimination ranged from 3 to 4 mm, with an average of 3.4 mm. All the patients were satisfied with the function and appearance of the involved finger.Our study suggests that the homodigital neuro vascular is a reliable choice of treatment for children fingertip defects.

TI  - The how and why of arm swing during human walking
PY  - 2013
AB  - Humans walk bipedally, and thus, it is unclear why they swing their arms. In this paper, we will review the mechanisms and functions of arm swinging in human gait.First, we discuss the potential advantages of having swinging arms. Second, we go into the detail on the debate whether arm swing is arising actively or passively, where we will conclude that while a large part of arm swinging is mechanically passive, there is an active contribution of muscles (i.e. an activity that is not merely caused by stretch reflexes). Third, we describe the possible function of the active muscular contribution to arm swinging in normal gait, and discuss the possibility that a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) generates this activity. Fourth, we discuss examples from pathological cases, in which arm swinging is affected. Moreover, using the ideas presented, we suggest ways in which arm swing may be used as a therapeutic aid.We conclude that (1) arm swing should be seen as an integral part of human bipedal gait, arising mostly from passive movements, which are stabilized by active muscle control, which mostly originates from locomotor circuits in the central nervous system (2) arm swinging during normal bipedal gait most likely serves to reduce energy expenditure and (3) arm swinging may be of therapeutic value.

TI  - The human horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex in response to active and passive head impulses after unilateral vestibular deafferentation
PY  - 2003
AB  - We studied the compensatory eye movements made by subjects with unilateral vestibular deficits in response to passive (unpredictable, manually generated) and active (predictable. self-generated) head impulses. A typical head impulse is a brief, low-amplitnde (15-20degrees), high-velocity (150-350degrees/s), high-acceleration (4000-6000degrees/s(2)), yaw head-on-trunk rotation. In the initial 75 ms of the response, the vestibulo-ocular reflex gain was significantly higher during active head impulses to both ipsilesional and contralesional sides, than during passive impulses. Mean gains were 0.15 (ipsilesional passive), 0.44 (ipsilesional active), 0.5 (contralesional passive), and 0.76 (contralesional active). Differences between active and passive head impulses were present from near the onset of head rotation. The mechanism for producing this behavior is unclear, but the findings could be related to enhanced sensitivity of second-order neurons during active head impulses. However, even with active movements, there is still a large and statistically significant asymmetry in the eye-movement responses for ipsilesional as opposed to contralesional head rotations. After 75 ms, rapid corrective eye movements often were generated to reduce any remaining gaze error.

TI  - The human red nucleus and lateral cerebellum in supporting roles for sensory information processing
PY  - 2000
AB  - A functional MRI study compared activation in the red nucleus to that in the lateral cerebellar dentate nucleus during passive and active tactile discrimination tasks. The study pursued recent neuroimaging results suggesting that the cerebellum may be more associated with sensory processing than with the control of movement for its own sake. Because the red nucleus interacts closely with the cerebellum, the possibility was examined that activity in red nucleus might also be driven by the requirement for tactile sensory processing with the fingers rather than by finger movement alone. The red and dentate nuclei were about 300% more active (a combination of activation areas and intensities) during passive (non-motor) tactile stimulation when discrimination was required than when it was not. Thus, the red nucleus was activated by purely sensory stimuli even in the absence of the opportunity to coordinate finger movements or to use the sensory cues to guide movement. The red and dentate nuclei were about 70% more active during active tactile tasks when discrimination was required than when it was not (i.e., for simple finger movements alone). Thus, the red nucleus was most active when the fingers were being used for tactile sensory discrimination. In both the passive and active tactile tasks, the observed activation had a contralateralized pattern, with stronger activation in the left red nucleus and right dentate nucleus. Significant covariation was observed between activity in the red nucleus and the contralateral dentate during the discrimination tasks and no significant correlation between the red nucleus and the contralateral dentate activity was detected during the two non-discrimination tasks. The observed interregional covariance and contralateralized activation patterns suggest strong functional connectivity during tactile discrimination tasks. Overall, the pattern of findings suggests that the activity in the red nucleus, as in the lateral cerebellum, is more driven by the requirements for sensory processing than by motor coordination per se.

TI  - The hyperbolic brower as a tool for information visualization, discovery, and retrieval on the web and enterprise intranets
PY  - 2009
AB  - Knowledge workers frequently need to locate task-relevant information quickly and efficiently through the Internet or their enterprise intranets. The ability to visualize how information is structured and organized is often a key to timely and efficient information discovery and retrieval. The traditional interface used for browsing Web sites has been a hierarchical, tree-like presentation, such as the Windows Explorer file/folder browser. From a user interface design standpoint, an attractive alternative to this type of browser is the hyperbolic browser, which is a focus + context technique for visualizing and browsing large amounts of hierarchical inter-related information. A hyperbolic view display efficiently represents hierarchical and associative information in a static or dynamic visual format using a relatively small display space. This paper discusses the characteristics of the hyperbolic browser, provides a real-life use case scenario to illustrate its application, and suggests avenues for future research and development.

TI  - The immediate reproduction of tactually perceived figures and the drawing process in reproducing the figures
PY  - 1967
AB  - The present paper was to analyze experimentally how the immediate reproduction of tactually perceived geometrical figures was influenced by some factors of touching such as (i) the movement of the hand, (ii) the starting point of touching, and (iii) the extent in tactual surface and others, and to examine what S's drawing process in reproducing the figures were, in order to find out the conditions necessary for the tactile apprehension of figures. In Exp. I, the two conditions of touching were set; (a) the condition of active touch in which S with closed eyes was asked to feel actively, moving his forefinger once along the contour of the figures, and (b) the condition of passive touch in which S was asked to hold constantly the finger on the same position and to feel once, passively, the contour of the figures which were moved by E. The four starting points of touching were set in each stimulus figure (Fig. 1). After touching a figure S was asked to reproduce it with open eyes. The results were: (1) The apprehension of figures in Active touch was better than in Passive touch (Table 2 and Fig. 2). (2) Point a was the most favorable starting point of touching in the scalene square. In the square and the lozenge, the starting points and the conditions of touching were interacting, and the favorable points for apprehension varied with the variation of stimulus figures (Table 1 and Fig. 2). All these favourable points, however, coincided with the starting points or the terminal points of open eyed drawing of the same figure (Table 6). Thus they were relevant to the drawing processes of figures in some respects. (3) In both Active and Passive touch, most of the S's reproduced the figures in uninterrupted lines, repeating the same course as in the touching condition (“continuous reproduction”). On the other hand, “dividing construction” which one employed ordinarily with open eyes in drawing the figures, scarecely appeared (Table 4). In Exp. II a four segment (Table 7) and in Exp. II b eight patterns (Table 8) were used as stimulus figures. Besides the conditions of Active and Passive touch, the two conditions as to the direction of touching were set in each figure (Table 7 and 8). The results in Exp. II a were: (1) Only the perception of the orientation of the segments in Active touch was better than that in Passive touch (Table 7). (2) For the vertical and horizontal segments in the active condition, the directions of touching which were favorable for perceiving tend to correspond to those of drawing of the lines (Fig. 4). In Exp. II b, on the other hand, it was observed that (3) the perception of the angles contained by two segments, that of the orientation of each segment, and that of the equivalence between a vertical segment and a horizontal one were all better under the active touch condition than were under the passive touch condition (Table 8 and 9), (4) In Active touch of the stimulus patterns consisting of a horizontal segment and a vertical one, the touching in the direction opposite to that of the drawing was more favorable for the correct perception than the touching in the same direction as that of drawing, in contrast with Exp. II a (Table 8). (5) In Exp. II a and II b most of Ss employed the “continuous reproduction”. In Exp. III Ss were allowed to feel a figure freely to their satisfaction, with one finger, one hand or both hands, respectively. The results were: (1) As the condition of touching shifted from “single touching” (Exp. I) to “free touching” with one finger (Exp. III), the perception of a figure gradually improved (Fig. 6). (2) The increase of tactual surface, however, did not necessary result in the improvement of the perception of a figure (Fig. 5). (3) “Dividing construction” remarkably increased in every condition of Exp. III (Table 13). (4) It was suggested that if perception of a figure remained ambiguous, one employed “continuous reproduction”, and also that as the perception of a figure became clear, one used “dividing construction” with which one connected components of a figure into a whole. (5) Analysis of touching processes revealed that the function of active motion and the increase in tactual surface gave more chances of performing some operations with which one could analyze features in components of a figure. © 1967, The Japanese Psychological Association.

TI  - The impact of Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) on progress made in rehabilitation by patients with trochanteric hip fractures treated surgically with a Y-type intramedullary nail
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background. The most important treatment goal in peritrochanteric hip fractures is for the patient to regain locomotion capability and the ability to perform activities of daily living. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of continuous passive motion (CPM) on regaining locomotor fitness and overall progress in rehabilitation when applied in an early stage of rehabilitation for patients with peritrochanteric hip fractures treated surgically using a Y-type intramedullary nail. Material and methods. The study was performed at the Cracow Rehabilitation Center from 1996 to 2000. From a population of 200 patients operated for peritrochanteric hip fractures with a Y-type intramedullary nail during this period, a random sample of 43 patients was selected (average age 77.8) for study. These patients were divided into Group 1, which received standard rehabilitation, and Group 2, which had CPM added to the standard program. Rehabilitation began on the first day after surgery. Examinations were performed at days 2, 5, 9 and 12 postoperatively to evaluate progress in rehabilitation, range of movement in the hip and knee, pain symptoms (using the Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), and the patient's subjective reports. The results were analyzed statistically. Results. The group of patients who received CPM had a better outcome than those who did not, as manifested in tests of range of movement and muscle strength, as well as the patients' subjective reports. These patients began learning to walk sooner without artificial supports, and reported less pain. In the group of patients without CPM the recovery of locomotion was significantly slower and had a lower dynamic in terms of muscle strength and motor fitness. Conclusions. The application of CPM in patients with fractures of the proximal end of the femur surgically treated with a Y-type intramedullary nail shortened the time needed for full recovery of physical condition and reduced pain. It can be recommended as a supplement to kinesitherapy.

TI  - The impact of environmental qualities and individual differences on spatial orientation in a mobile context
PY  - 2011
AB  - To contribute to cognitive engineering for mobile users, we propose that mobility itself, the environment, and individual differences all have to be incorporated into a unified framework. To make this argument, we present both a position statement and results from a behavioral study. Forty participants were taken individually to 12 locations on different floors in a library where they estimated their location and orientation on a map. Participants were randomly assigned to perform these tasks under one of two mobility conditions-either being required to stand in a single location (static) or being permitted to move before responding (active). Locations in the library were characterized using space syntax measures and individual differences were assessed using a battery of established tasks. Results show that mobility, environmental qualities, and individual differences all affect performance but that overall active exploration results in better performance. Through establishing this unified framework our research addresses fundamental questions of what it means-from a cognitive perspective-to be mobile.

TI  - The impact of long-term isolation on visual acuity [Vliianie dlitel'noi izoliatsii na ostrotu zreniia.]
PY  - 1997
AB  - During the experiment with 90- and 7-day isolation and confinement tests were applied to evaluate, along with static, expositional and dynamic (DVA) visual acuity using automated system VZGLIAD (Gaze). Test distance was 1 meter. To assess DVA, the subjects were requested to make oscillatory movements with the head in the horizontal plane with a metronome frequency at 1 Hz. An upward trend in static visual acuity was interpreted as a result of myopization engendered by exposure to confinement and video display. A significant loss in expositional (and dynamic) visual acuity was stated in the main (p > 0.01) and visiting (p > 0.1) crews. These shifts could be associated with the dominance of inhibitory processes in the visual cortex due to monotony of the visual environment and insufficient oculomotor and accommodative activities.

TI  - The impact of note-taking while listening on listening comprehension in a higher education context
PY  - 2013
AB  - Currently, lecturing dominates higher education as the most frequently used method due to certain conditions in this context. Various methods and techniques have been developed and some research studies have been carried out to help learners avoid being passive listeners in a context where lecturing is frequently used. This study aims to research how listening to different lecture types (informative, narrative and philosophical) by notetaking affects listening comprehension. The study, carried out in the Department of Turkish Language Teaching at the Faculty of Education, Cumhuriyet University, adopts an experimental design with a pretest and posttest. To analyze the data, t-test was carried out using SPSS 18. According to the results of the study, there were higher levels of comprehension for all three lecture types in favour of the participants who took notes while listening to the lectures. It is recommended that learners be trained to acquire active learning, active listening and note-taking skills.

TI  - The impact of parkinson's disease on the cortical mechanisms that support auditory-motor integration for voice control
PY  - 2016
AB  - Several studies have shown sensorimotor deficits in speech processing in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study, 18 individuals with PD and 18 healthy controls were exposed to frequency-altered feedback (FAF) while producing a sustained vowel and listening to the playback of their own voice. Behavioral results revealed that individuals with PD produced significantly larger vocal compensation for pitch feedback errors than healthy controls, and exhibited a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of their vocal responses and the variability of their unaltered vocal pitch. At the cortical level, larger P2 responses were observed for individuals with PD compared with healthy controls during active vocalization due to left-lateralized enhanced activity in the superior and inferior frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and superior temporal gyrus. These two groups did not differ, however, when they passively listened to the playback of their own voice. Individuals with PD also exhibited larger P2 responses during active vocalization when compared with passive listening due to enhanced activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, precental gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. This enhancement effect, however, was not observed for healthy controls. These findings provide neural evidence for the abnormal auditory-vocal integration for voice control in individuals with PD, which may be caused by their deficits in the detection and correction of errors in voice auditory feedback.

TI  - The implementation of low-cost urban acoustic monitoring devices
PY  - 2017
AB  - The urban sound environment of New York City (NYC) can be, amongst other things: loud, intrusive, exciting and dynamic. As indicated by the large majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information complaints line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on the quality of life of the city's inhabitants. To monitor and ultimately understand these sonic environments, a process of long-term acoustic measurement and analysis is required. The traditional method of environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes short term measurement periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by experienced and costly personnel. In this paper a different approach is proposed to this application which implements a smart, low-cost, static, acoustic sensing device based around consumer hardware. These devices can be deployed in numerous and varied urban locations for long periods of time, allowing for the collection of longitudinal urban acoustic data. The varied environmental conditions of urban settings make for a challenge in gathering calibrated sound pressure level data for prospective stakeholders. This paper details the sensors' design, development and potential future applications, with a focus on the calibration of the devices' Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone in order to generate reliable decibel levels at the type/class 2 level.

TI  - The importance of Psychomotricity in Children with Childhood Paralysis The importance of Psychomotricity in Children with Childhood Paralysis
PY  - 2016
AB  - SUMMARY Through this work, which was carried out through bibliographical references, where Physical Education classes and psychomotor practice are the main aid tool in learning, where the objective of contributing to the integral development of students, using psychomotricity and the possibilities of Intervention of the complaints of learning difficulties through the psychomotor practice, which explores the bodily functions. The influence of motor activity and manipulation on global learning was supported by the perspective that active movement is important for perceptual development but can not be replaced by passive movements. On the other hand, psychomotor activity is considered the internalization of movement, and the relationship of the body to space. Learning is a global process that involves the whole body, so the physical aspects and the cognitive, affective-emotional and motor link in the actions and in the school learning process are observed in Physical Education classes. There are suggestions of exercises, games and games as a contribution to the motor, social and emotional development of the body movements in the promotion of the totality of the human being. When the issue is faced with disadvantaged children, especially with special educational needs of motor character, as is the case of cerebral palsy, the tonic can gain particular expression. Psychomotor and social experiences are sometimes hampered by conditions that deprive children of autonomously and spontaneously occurring experiences, typically resulting from global development. In this text we will review studies of the impact of motorized experience on development and learning, especially the role of active exploration in the early years. This approach and its discussion, with emphasis on the learning and development of children with special needs and how motorized special education programs.

TI  - The importance of body-based cues for travelled distance perception
PY  - 2010
AB  - When moving through space, both dynamic visual information (i.e. optic flow) and body-based cues (i.e. proprioceptive and vestibular) jointly specify the extent of a travelled distance. Little is currently known about the relative contributions of each of these cues when several are simultaneously available. In this series of experiments participants travelled a predefined distance and subsequently reproduced this distance by adjusting a visual target until the self-to-target distance matched the distance they had moved. Visual information was presented through a head-mounted display and consisted of a long, richly textured, virtual hallway. Body-based cues were provided either by A) natural walking in a fully-tracked free walking space (proprioception and vestibular) B) being passively moved by a robotic wheelchair (vestibular) or C) walking in place on a treadmill (proprioception). Distances were either presented through vision alone, body-based cues alone, or both visual and body-based cues combined. In the combined condition, the visually-specified distances were either congruent (1.0x) or incongruent (0.7x/1.4x) with distances specified by body-based cues. Incongruencies were created by either changing the visual gain or changing the proprioceptive gain (during treadmill walking). Further, in order to obtain a measure of &ldquo;perceptual congruency&rdquo; between visual and body-based cues, participants were asked to adjust the rate of optic flow during walking so that it matched the proprioceptive information. This value was then used as the basis for later congruent cue trials. Overall, results demonstrate a higher weighting of body-based cues during natural walking, a higher weighting of proprioceptive information during treadmill walking, and an equal weighting of visual and vestibular cues during passive movement. These results were not affected by whether visual or proprioceptive gain was manipulated. Adopting the obtained measure of perceptual congruency for each participant also did not change the conclusions such that proprioceptive cues continued to be weighted higher.

TI  - The importance of hands-on learning
PY  - 2007
AB  - As trainers we must focus on the learners outcome. Hands-on learning allows students to incorporate what is being taught into real world situations, thus allowing the student to retain more information. By allowing students to interact with one another as in role-play, practical applications or simulations they can relate what they are learning to their own work environment. Plus it helps cement the concepts of the learning into their long-term memory. If the hands-on activity is positive they will use it as training tool themselves. Remember: • Adult learners need to understand why they are learning a new task/skill • Adults learn better through active experience than passive listening • Adults learn better through interacting with one another than working alone.

TI  - The importance of measuring dynamic visual acuity [Važnost mjerenja dinamičke vidne oštrine]
PY  - 2013
AB  - In their everyday life, people interact with different objects, static as well as those in motion. However, dynamic acuity is rarely checked in medical examinations, even those preceding the issue of driving license. In order for driving to be safe, good eyesight or good correction with visual aids is imperative. Beside good eyesight, drivers also have to have good reflexes and short reaction span. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic and static visual acuity in order to observe how they vary among individuals. Twenty female and male participants, 65 years of age, took part in the study and the comparison was made with the results provided by 20 20-year old participants. Dynamic acuity was tested using the Landolt-ring optotype which was simulating movement velocity of 72 km/h. T-test demonstrated the presence of a statistically significant difference between dynamic and static acuity among the participants from 62 to 68 years of age (t= 15.852; df=39; p<0.01). Within the same group, dynamic acuity (mean=0.887; std. deviation=0.297) proved to be significantly worse than static acuity (mean=1.40; std. deviation=0.317). By comparing the results measured within the older group of participants with those measured in the younger group, it was shown that there exists a statistically significant difference (t=0.275; df=58; p<0,05) between the older and younger group in their dynamic binocular acuity with correction. Younger participants had better dynamic binocular acuity with correction (mean=1.063; std. deviation =0.259) than the older participants (mean=0.884; std. deviation=0.298). The differences between dynamic and static acuity and its degradation in the older age groups have to be taken into account when issuing driving licenses. The future of research lies within the study of correlation between the age and acuity in order that the results can be applied in practice.

TI  - The in vitro reversal of the lenticular cation shift induced by cold or calcium deficiency
PY  - 1953
AB  - 1. 1. The loss of potassium and gain of sodium which are observed when the metabolism of the lens is decreased by refrigeration were found to be reversible when the temperature of the lens was raised to 37 °C., potassium re-entered the cell and sodium was excreted from it. 2. 2. Glutamic acid enhanced the accumulation of potassium by and excretion of sodium from the previously refrigerated rabbit lens during incubation at 37 °C. The kinetics of the cation shift were determined. 3. 3. The cation shift toward a true equilibrium induced in a calcium deficient medium was reversed when calcium was added. 4. 4. A gradual increase in the concentration of potassium and sodium by the lens was noted during incubation of the fresh lens. This was due to both an increase in the total amount of cation and a dehydration of the lens. 5. 5. The results confirm the current concept that any cation ratio is a balance between two opposing movements of cation, one against a concentration gradient which is due to an active transfer mechanism and the other with a concentration gradient representing a passive movement through normally permeable barriers. © 1953.

TI  - The independent and interactive effects of navicular drop and quadriceps angle on neuromuscular responses to a weight-bearing perturbation
PY  - 2006
AB  - Context: Little is known about the effects of static alignment on neuromuscular control of the knee during dynamic motion. Objective: To evaluate the isolated and combined effects of quadriceps angle (QA) and navicular drop (ND) on neuromuscular responses to a weight-bearing perturbation. Design: Mixed-model, repeated-measures design. Setting: Sports medicine and athletic training research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Seventy-nine National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate female athletes, classified with below-average ND and QA (LND-LQA); below-average ND and above-average QA (LND-HQA); above-average ND and below-average QA (HND-LQA); or above-average ND and QA (HND-HQA). Intervention(s): A lower extremity perturbation device produced a forward and either internal or external rotation of the trunk and femur on the weight-bearing tibia to evoke a reflex response. Main Outcome Measure(s): Neuromuscular responses were examined in the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles: preperturbation amplitude 50 milliseconds before the perturbation, reflex time, and postperturbation amplitude 150 milliseconds immediately postperturbation. Results: Navicular drop had the greatest effect on preperturbation amplitude of the lateral hamstrings and postperturbation amplitude of all muscles, with greater activation amplitude noted in subjects in the HND classifications. Quadriceps angle primarily affected reflex time of the quadriceps; in subjects with LQA, reflex time was faster for internal rotation than external rotation perturbations. The interaction between ND and QA had the greatest effect on reflex time of the lateral hamstrings. For internal rotation perturbations, subjects in the LND classifications had faster reflex times in the lateral hamstrings if they had HQA values rather than LQA values. With external rotation perturbations, HND-LQA subjects had slower reflex times than those in all other alignment classifications. Conclusions: Navicular drop and QA have both independent and interactive effects on neuromuscular responses to a weight-bearing, rotational perturbation. These interactive effects highlight the importance of considering the entire lower extremity posture rather than a single alignment characteristic, given the potential for one alignment factor to compensate for or interact with another. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

TI  - The individuality of weightbearing patterns of human gait [DIE INDIVIDUALITAT DER BELASTUNGSMUSTER DES MENSCHLICHEN GANGES. (MESSUNGEN DER BEIM GEHEN AUFTRETENDEN KRAFTE AUF DEM BODEN)]
PY  - 1977
AB  - Measurements have been carried out on a quartz-crystal multicomponent platform. The forces exerted by people walking on it could be measured as transverse, horizontal and vertical forces. The total was assessed with the aid of the components. The torsion-element in the vertical axis was also measured. The patterns varied significantly with individuals. In general, pressures rose with walking speed. Individual patterns of movements, like elastic or stiff gait, showed clear differences. These are explained by the individual dynamic associated movements. These measurements do not permit direct conclusions as to weightbearing, but they demonstrate forces of dynamic movement. They do support the conclusion that static considerations of weightbearing, which omit the likely weightbearing-reducing forces of associated movements of the limbs, will give only a very fragmentary impression.

TI  - The inertia tensor versus static moment and mass in perceiving length and heaviness of hand-wielded rods
PY  - 2002
AB  - In 2 experiments, participants haptically estimated length and heaviness of handheld rods while wielding without seeing them. The sets of rods had been constructed such that variation of static moment and the 1st eigenvalue of the inertia tensor (1,) were separated. Consistent with previous findings, perceived rod length correlated strongly with I-1. However, multiple regressions on current data as well as data from previous studies showed a comparable strong correlation between perceived rod length and static moment plus mass. Contrary to previous findings, perceived heaviness correlated strongly with static moment and only weakly with the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor. These results suggest that the inertia tensor does not provide the sole foundation for a theory of dynamic touch.

TI  - The influence of a controlled active motion splint on proprioception after anterior cruciate ligament plasty. A prospective randomized study
PY  - 2006
AB  - Background. A ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) leads to both mechanical and functional instability. Functional instability is caused by proprioceptive deficit. The aim of this study was to determine whether the proprioceptive deficit can be reduced by using a controlled active motion (CAM) splint postoperatively.Patients and methods. A total of 50 patients with ACL rupture were randomized into two groups. After ACL plasty the PT group received postoperative physiotherapy, while the CAM group were managed with a CAM splint and physiotherapy. Proprioceptive ability was measured with a passive angle-reproduction test.Results. On the day of discharge 80% of the patients in the CAM group and 25% in the PT group had a reduced proprioceptive deficit. Overall the main measured value in the CAM group improved by 83.7%, but deteriorated by 39.3% in the PT group. There was no significant difference between the CAM group and a healthy control group.Conclusion. Using a CAM splint in addition to physiotherapy after ACL plasty in comparison to physiotherapy alone decreases the proprioceptive deficit significantly. We recommend the use of a CAM splint in the postoperative management following ACL plasty.

TI  - The influence of a foot orthotic on lower extremity transverse plane kinematics in collegiate female athletes with pes planus
PY  - 2006
AB  - Non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female athletes remain prevalent. Athletes with excessive foot pronation have been identified to be at greater risk for non-contact ACL injury. Excessive foot pronation has been linked to increased medial tibial rotation. Increased medial tibial rotation heightens ACL strain and has been observed at or near the time of ACL injury. Foot orthotics have been shown to decrease medial tibial rotation during walking and running tasks. The effect of a foot orthotic on activities that simulate a non-contact ACL injury mechanism (i.e. landing) however is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether a foot orthotic was capable of altering transverse plane lower extremity kinematics in female athletes during landing. Twenty uninjured collegiate female athletes participating in the sports of basketball, soccer or volleyball with pes planus volunteered. Utilizing a repeated measures counterbalanced design, subjects completed two landing tasks with and without a foot orthotic using standardized footwear. The prefabricated orthotic had a rigid shell and a 6 extrinsic rear-foot varus post. Dependent measures included initial contact angle, peak angle, excursion and time to peak angle for both the tibia and femur. Statistical analysis suggested that the selected foot orthosis had little influence over lower extremity transverse plane kinematics. Several factors including: the limitation of a static measure to predict dynamic movement, inter-subject variability and the physical characteristics of the orthotic device likely account for the results. Future research should examine the influence of different types of foot orthotics not only on lower extremity kinematics but also tibiofemoral kinetics.

TI  - The influence of abductor lever-arm changes after shoulder arthroplasty.
PY  - 1993
AB  - Clinically, pain relief is usually satisfactory after shoulder arthroplasty, but the range of motion can be limited. The changes of the lever-arms of deltoid and supraspinatus muscles are considered to be important factors influencing postoperative active motion. After excluding patients with muscle weakness resulting from a neurologic condition, patients with chronic rotator-cuff tears, patients who did not follow rehabilitation guidelines, and patients with bilateral arthroplasties, 22 arthroplasty cases remained and were evaluated. Compared with the unaffected side, four radiologic parameters were assessed: (A) offset of humeral head, (B) lateralization of humeral head, (C) acromiohumeral interval, and (D) superoinferior migration of humeral head. The differences were measured and statistically analyzed. In summary: (1) The active and passive range of motion of abduction in scapular plane were 89.5° ± 26.1° and 109.7° ± 25.0°. (2) Parameters A, B, and C statistically changed (p < 0.05). (3) B value of the operated side was reduced below zero in six (27.3%). (4) There was a tendency to create medial shifting and inferior subluxation with the arthroplasty. This had a moderate adverse correlation to the active range of motion (correlation coefficient 0.498). (5) Before normalization for bone size, only C as a single parameter had moderate correlation with motion; after normalization, this decreased. (6) If combined parameters were assessed, A + C had a moderate correlation (correlation coefficient 0.435) with motion. (7) If an accurate anatomic relationship cannot be completely restored, A seemed more significant than any other parameters (p = 0.002); namely, shoulders with a smaller offset had a more limited active range of motion in abduction.

TI  - The influence of information technologies on the availability of cultural heritage
PY  - 2015
AB  - Information technologies have offered new possibilities of the development of the market of tourist services and led to the creation of various client oriented information systems in the museum business. Museums have started to introduce information technologies in the sphere of accounting, storage and research into collections, to use multimedia, which include both traditional static visual information and dynamic information (such as speech, music, video footage and animation). TicketNet has helped greatly to attract more visitors. QR-codes revolutionized the museum business. Nowadays all museums have their own websites and experts believe that the number of virtual visitors will exceed the number of real ones in the near future. Therefore, scientists face a new problem of researching both negative and positive consequences of cultural heritage transfer into virtual reality. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The influence of lumbar degenerative disc disease with disc herniation on the range of movements in the hip joints
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: The study was to assess the influence of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) with disc herniation on the range of passive and active movements in the hip joints. There are undoubtful biomechanical interdependences between hip joints and lumbar spine present also in pathological states. Recognition of those relationships could influence therapeutic procedures. Material and methods: Study material consisted of 160 randomly assigned patients suffering from lumbar DDD with disc herniation and radicular pain syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by spinal MRI in every case. Passive and active movements in the hip joint on the side of radicular pain and on the opposite side were assessed with hand goniometer. The measurement of muscle strength in the hip joint was performed with use of chair measuring apparatus. Condition of hip joints was assessed by radiological examinations. Results were sorted according to the body side and duration of radicular pain syndrome as well as the level of lumbar hernia Results: On the side of radicular pain there was decrease in range of passive extension (on average 10.85° at the painful side and 13.25° on the opposite side) and active extension (8.41° and 10.15°, respectively) as well as in range of passive abduction (33.1° and 36.4°, respectively). Muscle strength of hip joint abductors was significantly lower on the side of radicular syndrome (126.5 N on the side of radicular syndrome and 151 N on the opposite side, p < 0.0001). Osteophytes on the acetabular edge were more frequent and larger on the side of radicular syndrome - they were present in 37% of persons and their mean size was 4.9 mm in comparison to the respective values of 23% and 2.6 mm on the opposite side. Conclusions: 1. Lumbar DDD with disc herniation decreases range of movements in the hip joints. 2. Decrease in range of movement and muscle strength in the hip is observed on the side of radicular pain syndrome and increases with duration of the syndrome. These facts confirm pathogenic influence of lumbar DDD with disc herniation on the hip joint function and structure.

AB  - In this experiment, static visual acuity and dynamic visual acuity were tested with standard visual acuity charts and vision testing software for three groups of people in different age groups under different lighting conditions. The results showed that the dynamic visual acuity and static visual acuity had a certain correlation with each other and the dynamic vision was always lower than static vision. Static vision and dynamic vision were gradually decreased with increasing of the age. As the brightness of the screen increased, the individual’s vision acuity increased. The moving speed of visual icons had great effect on the visual acuity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

TI  - The influence of the chloride gradient across red cell membranes on sodium and potassium movements
PY  - 1971
AB  - 1. A study has been made to see whether active and passive movements of sodium and potassium in human red blood cells are influenced by changing the chloride gradient and hence the potential difference across the cell membrane. 2. Chloride distribution was measured between red cells and isotonic solutions with a range of concentrations of chloride and non‐penetrating anions (EDTA, citrate, gluconate). The cell chloride concentration was greater than that outside with low external chloride, suggesting that the sign of the membrane potential was reversed. The chloride ratio (internal/external) was approximately equal to the inverse of the hydrogen ion ratio at normal and low external chloride, and inversely proportional to external pH. These results show that chloride is passively distributed, making it valid to calculate the membrane potential from the chloride ratio. 3. Ouabain‐sensitive (pump) potassium influx and sodium efflux were decreased by not more than 20 and 40% respectively on reversing the chloride gradient, corresponding to a change in membrane potential from −9 to +30 mV. In contrast, passive (ouabain‐insensitive) movements were reversibly altered — potassium influx was decreased about 60% and potassium efflux was increased some tenfold. Sodium influx was unaffected by the nature of the anion and depended only on the external sodium concentration, whereas ouabain‐insensitive sodium efflux was increased about threefold. When external sodium was replaced by potassium there was a decrease in ouabain‐insensitive sodium efflux with normal chloride, but an increase in low‐chloride medium. 4. Net movements of sodium and potassium were roughly in accord with the unidirectional fluxes. 5. The results suggest that reversing the chloride gradient and, therefore, the sign of the membrane potential, had little effect on the sodium pump, but caused a marked increase in passive outward movements of both sodium and potassium ions. © 1971 The Physiological Society

TI  - The influence of travel behavior on cognition of urban environment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: A widely accepted claim in research on spatial cognition says that the acquisition of spatial knowledge occurs through an active human-environment interaction. Mobility patterns to and through the activity sites belong to the most significant types of everyday spatial behavior in large scale settings and, thus, have impacts on the acquisition and processing of spatial knowledge. Aims: This paper examines the effect of travel behavior on the acquisition of spatial knowledge in urban environment. Method: Two groups of participants living in Riga were surveyed: youth aged 12-17 (n = 213) and adults (n = 176). To acquire data reflecting cognitive representations of urban environment we applied a spatial preposition task and two distance estimation tasks. Results: The analysis of data shows that the mode of transportation and the level of mobility significantly determine the extent of spatial knowledge. Those participants from both groups that are more active travelers (e.g., frequently walk or bicycle) are more accurate in distance estimation and spatial preposition tasks. At the same time there are no significant differences among those who use passive modes of transportation: the accuracy in spatial representations of urban environment was similar among car drivers, public transport users and car passengers. Therefore, our findings do not support the assumption that car driving is a type of active exploration of the environment. Conclusions: Our study provides clear evidence that the increase in active interaction with the urban environment generates a richer and more accurate representation of it. Diverse urban transportation experiences have impact on different cognitive structures of urban environment and further shape the processes of spatial decision making and navigation.

TI  - The influence of troughs and crests of ripple marks on the structure of subtidal benthic assemblages around rocky reefs
PY  - 2004
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that the small-scale topography caused by ripples in sediment would affect benthic macrofaunal assemblages. Ripple marks were measured and macrofauna and sediments were sampled near to and far from subtidal rocky reefs at two sites. Ripples were significantly wider and taller close to than far from reefs. Sediment grain-size was significantly different between crests and troughs. Microtopography clearly influenced the structure of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages in three of the four locations (and 8 of the 12 sites) examined. Numbers of taxa of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages and almost all individual taxa analysed showed significant greater abundances in troughs than in crests. The results strongly support the model that benthic macrofauna are affected by locally varying hydrodynamic environments produced by ripple-beds. These, in turn, were influenced by their proximity to a reef. Models about passive transport of the macrofauna by water-movement and active movements of the fauna are discussed. Furthermore, it appeared that there was a relationship between spatial variability of the macrofaunal assemblages and size of ripples. It is suggested that microtopography should be considered in experimental designs when patterns of distribution of benthic organisms are being evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The influence of wrist position on the minimum force required for active movement of the interphalangeal joints
PY  - 1988
AB  - Active and passive muscle tension is discussed in relation to finger flexor and extensor tendons. Minimising active tension required to produce finger movement is seen as an important part of post-operative finger mobilisation following flexor tendon repair in which active movement is used. It is argued that "minimal active tension" in the flexors is equal to, or just exceeds, the passive tension in the extensors. A method of measuring passive tension in finger tendons has been described. In 24 volunteers, it has been used to determine that if the metacarpo-phalangeal joints are held flexed, there is least "minimal active tension" in the flexor tendonos when the wrist is splinted in extension. © 1988.

TI  - The influence of yaw motion on the perception of active vs passive visual curvilinear displacement
PY  - 2015
AB  - Self-motion perception, which partly determines the realism of dynamic driving simulators, is based on multisensory integration. However, it remains unclear how the brain integrates these cues to create adequate motion perception, especially for curvilinear displacements. In the present study, the effect of visual, inertial and visuo-inertial cues (concordant or discordant bimodal cues) on self-motion perception was analyzed. Subjects were asked to evaluate (externally produced) or produce (self-controlled) curvilinear displacements as accurately as possible. The results show systematic overestimation of displacement, with better performance for active subjects than for passive ones. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that participants used unimodal or bimodal cues differently in performing their activity. When passive, subjects systematically integrated visual and inertial cues even when discordant, but with weightings that depended on the dynamics. On the contrary, active subjects were able to reject the inertial cue when the discordance became too high, producing self-motion perception on the basis of more reliable information. Thereby, multisensory integration seems to follow a non-linear integration model of, i.e., the cues' weight changes with the cue reliability and/or the intensity of the stimuli, as reported by previous studies. These results represent a basis for the adaptation of motion cueing algorithms are developed for dynamic driving simulators, by taking into account the dynamics of simulated motion in line with the status of the participants (driver or passenger).

TI  - The initial phase of exercise hyperpnoea in humans is depressed during a cognitive task
PY  - 2005
AB  - Increased wakefulness is known to suppress the initial ventilatory response to passive movement and the steady-state ventilatory response to exercise. However, the effect of increased wakefulness upon the integrated ventilatory response at the onset of exercise is not known. We hypothesized that increasing wakefulness via a cognitive task would attenuate the initial ventilatory response to exercise, and so we examined the response to active leg extensions under two conditions: with and without concurrently solving a puzzle. At rest before exercise, subjects demonstrated greater minute ventilation while solving a puzzle ( mean +/- S. E. M., 12.38 +/- 0.55 versus 10.12 +/- 0.51 l min(-1), P < 0.001), due to a higher mean breathing frequency ( mean +/- S. E. M., 17.1 +/- 0.93 versus 13.6 +/- 0.59 breaths min(-1), P < 0.001). At the start of exercise, subjects did not increase their ventilation significantly while solving the puzzle ( P = 0.170), but did by a mean +/- S. E. M. of 6.16 +/- 1.12 l min(-1) ( P < 0.001) when not puzzle solving. The ventilation achieved at the start of exercise in absolute terms was also lower while solving the puzzle ( 14.6 +/- 1.1 versus 16.3 +/- 1.3 l min(-1), P = 0.047). Despite differences in the rapid ventilatory response to exercise between conditions, the steady-state responses were not different. We conclude that the performance of a cognitive task decreases the initial phase of exercise hyperpnoea, and suggest that this might occur because of either a competitive interaction between drives to breathe or a behavioural distraction from the 'task' of exercise.

TI  - The integration and dissociation of thermal and frictional cues during material identification
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study investigated the effects of thermal and frictional cues during a forced-choice material identification task. Thermal properties of the three materials presented (pine, Lexan, aluminum) were conveyed using either real materials or a temperature-controlled aluminum pad to simulate real material effusivities. Friction either varied for the real materials presented, or was constant when the temperature-controlled aluminum simulation pad was presented. Experiments I and 2 employed natural materials, while experiments 3 and 4 involved thermal simulations. Thermal cues alone were allowed in experiments I and 3 by allowing participants only static exploration with the index finger, with cutaneous contact only in the normal direction. In Experiments 2 and 4, there was dynamic exploration by lateral stroking of the index finger, allowing both thermal and friction cues to be transmitted. Dependent measures included a judgment of the material that was explored, as well as contact forces. The simulation of material effusivity was shown to be valid as participants had identification accuracies that were similar to real materials during static exploration. Material identification accuracy was higher when congruent cues were presented and was lower when incongruent cues were presented. Peak normal force was higher during static exploration, compared to dynamic. These results were interpreted in terms of a framework of single modality competition and cooperation.

TI  - The internal representation of head orientation differs for conscious perception and balance control
PY  - 2017
AB  - Vestibular signals used for balance controlmust be integrated with other sensorimotor cues to allowtransformation of descending signals according to an internal representation of body configuration. We explored two alternative models of sensorimotor integration that propose (1) a single internal representation of head-on-feet orientation is responsible for perceived postural orientation and standing balance or (2) conscious perception and balance control are driven by separate internal representations. During three experiments, participants stood quietly while passively or actively maintaining a prolonged head-turned posture (> 10 min). Throughout the trials, participants intermittently reported their perceived head angular position, and subsequently electrical vestibular stimuli were delivered to elicit whole-body balance responses. Visual recalibration of head-on-feet posture was used to determine whether static visual cues are used to update the internal representation of body configuration for perceived orientation and standing balance. All three experiments involved situations in which the vestibular-evoked balance response was not orthogonal to perceived head-on-feet orientation, regardless of the visual information provided. For prolonged head-turned postures, balance responses consistent with actual head-on-feet posture occurred only during the active condition. Our results indicate that conscious perception of head-on-feet posture and vestibular control of balance do not rely on the same internal representation, but instead treat sensorimotor cues in parallel and may arrive at different conclusions regarding head-on-feet posture. The balance system appears to bypass static visual cues of postural orientation and mainly use other sensorimotor signals of head-on-feet position to transform vestibular signals of head motion, a mechanism appropriate for most daily activities.

TI  - The investigation of the effect of exercises on static and dynamic balance using balance master in Parkinson's disease
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of exercises in the Parkinson's disease patients using balance master. Background: Balance Master provides objective assessment and retraining of the sensory and voluntary motor control of balance with visual biofeedback on either a stable or unstable support surface and in a stable or dynamic visual environment. Methods: Seventeen Parkinson's disease patients, 11 males (%64.7), and 6 females (%64.7), mean age 65.7668.10; with the same disability participated in this study. Exercises were given suitably according to disability levels. Exercises including posture, balance and coorination were performed by physioterapist's supervision three days a week lasting 45-60 minutes for twelve weeks. Balanced master was used in assessing static and dynamic balance parameters in the assessments of the patients' balance.Balance master tests consisted of the modified clinical test for sensory interaction on balance (mCTSIB), unilateral stance, limits of stability, rhythmic weight shift, tandem walk, step/quick turn and sit to stand. The measurements were assessed before and after twelve-week exercises program. Results: In the unilateral balance on the right leg, significant difference was found (p>0.05) in the parameters of movement velocity, directional control, endpoint excursion and maximum excursion of limit of stability. Conclusions: The exercise program, according to our balance master test results about dynamic balance, was found effective more than static balance.

TI  - The knee adduction angle of the osteo-arthritic knee: A comparison of 3D supine, static and dynamic alignment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: End-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA) commonly results in knee arthroplasty. Three dimensional (3D) supine imaging is often used for pre-operative planning to optimise post-operative knee adduction angles (KAA). However, supine imaging may not represent loaded knee alignment. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in knee alignment under supine, static and dynamic conditions in healthy subjects and subjects with knee OA. Methods: Nine healthy subjects and 15 subjects with end-stage knee OA were recruited. All subjects underwent supine imaging and motion capture during gait. KAAs were calculated from supine images (SUPINE), upright standing (STATIC) and at the first peak ground reaction force during gait (DYNAMIC), and were compared. Results: KAAs were significantly higher (more varus) during gait compared with static (loaded and unloaded) in healthy subjects (p&lt;0.01) but not in subjects with knee OA. There was a good correlation between SUPINE and DYNAMIC for both healthy and OA subjects (R2&gt;0.58), with differences in the two relationships; healthy knees had a higher KAA during gait for any given KAA in the supine position, whereas OA knees that were valgus in imaging became more valgus during gait, and the opposite occurred for varus knees. Conclusions: Factors that may contribute to the noted differences between healthy and OA subjects include morphological changes in the joint as a result of OA, and gait compensation strategies in people with end-stage OA. Dynamic 3D motion capture provides important information about functional alignment that is not provided by supine imaging or static motion capture. Clinical Relevance: Gait analysis may provide useful information to the surgeon during surgical planning of knee arthroplasties. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The knee smartphone-application goniometer is a more reliable tool than the standard goniometer in acute orthopaedic settings
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: To assess range of movement (ROM) in patients with knee restriction the goniometer is the most used tool. However, some authors suggest that limb goniometry may contain errors of between 5degree and 10degree. Smartphone devices led developers to create a library of software applications. Among these, more than 7000 medical applications are documented. The in-built smartphone accelerometers capacities are explored as novel tools to assist clinicians in tasks such as motion analysis. These have already been used to measure knee flexion but to our knowledge only in healthy subjects. Purpose: To determine if these applications offers reliable information to clinicians. This was the first clinical test of an application in a post-operative situation. Methods: This clinical reliability trial hypothesised that application goniometers are as reliable as the standard goniometer when measuring knee ROM. Based on a pilot study and power calculations (80% power) a sample size of twenty knees per group was determined: healthy subjects group (HS) and the acute post-operative knee surgery group (PO). The measurements were performed in a university orthopaedic hospital, three times for the active extension, passive extension, active flexion and passive flexion with both instruments. The instruments used were the standard goniometer (SG) and the application "Knee Goniometer" (APP) installed in an iPhone 4S. A professor in orthopaedics, a recent graduated doctor in medicine, and an experienced physiotherapist (>5years of experience) took all the measurements. Each clinician was single blinded. All ROM measurements were taken under the same conditions. For variability analysis between using three or a single ROM measurement in post-operative patients a third group of 20 post-operative patients (PO1) was created. ROM of PO1 patients was assessed with a single active movement measurement in knee flexion and knee extension. Results: Intra-tester reliability: Mean ICC values were higher for the APP in all circumstances. Results indicate an excellent correlation score with the APP in all groups and with the SG in the PO (ICC's > 0.80). The correlation of the SG in the HS is considered as strong correlation (ICC = 0.74). Inter-tester reliability: The HS ICC scores were low both with theSG(range 0.00-0.71) and the App (range 0.00-0.86). On the PO ICC scores were low (range 0.00-0.65 with the SG and 0.00-0.45 with the APP). In the PO1, ICC scores were low to excellent (range 0.39-0.71 with the SG and 0.72-0.86 with the APP). Considering the PO1, the mean ICC inter-observer scores found using the APP were higher in all movements with regards to the SG. Conclusion(s): The APP is a reliable tool to be used in the acute orthopaedic care. Knee flexion is a more reliable measurement than knee extension and the App offers better intra- and inter-rater correlation scores providing a single active measurement. Implications: Increased precision determining a ROM; Lower differences between clinicians when measuring the same condition in a given time; Possibility to develop connectivity systems able to automatically stock the data in central clinical files; Progressive substitution of the SG by accelerometer-based goniometers; Open door to use accelerometer-based goniometers on other joints.

TI  - The landscape ecology of Collembola
PY  - 2009
AB  - Soil animal communities are rarely considered by landscape ecologists, although they arc an important component of terrestrial ecosystems due to their high local biodiversity, high abundance and pivotal ecosystem functions. Processes acting on landscape scales influence their communities probably to a much larger extent than commonly assumed by most soil ecologists. The presentation gives an overview of the current knowledge of two landscape ecological processes and patterns that arc relevant for Collembola (Springtails). Both landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation was round to influence the diversity and community composition of Collembola. The active movement and passive dispersal of Collembola within the landscape is discussed and maybe a relevant factor in the patterns we find.

TI  - The long- and short-term variability of breathing induced tumor motion in lung and liver over the course of a radiotherapy treatment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the short and long-term variability of breathing induced tumor motion.Materials and methods: 3D tumor motion of 19 lung and 18 liver lesions captured over the course of an SBRT treatment were evaluated and compared to the motion on 4D-CT. An implanted fiducial could be used for unambiguous motion information. Fast orthogonal fluoroscopy (FF) sequences, included in the treatment workflow, were used to evaluate motion during treatment.Materials and methods: Several motion parameters were compared between different FF sequences from the same fraction to evaluate the intrafraction variability. To assess interfraction variability, amplitude and hysteresis were compared between fractions and with the 3D tumor motion registered by 4D-CT. Population based margins, necessary on top of the ITV to capture all motion variability, were calculated based on the motion captured during treatment.Results: Baseline drift in the cranio-caudal (CC) or anterior-poster (AP) direction is significant (ie. >5 mm) for a large group of patients, in contrary to intrafraction amplitude and hysteresis variability. However, a correlation between intrafraction amplitude variability and mean motion amplitude was found (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.72, p < 10(-4)). Interfraction variability in amplitude is significant for 46% of all lesions. As such, 4D-CT accurately captures the motion during treatment for some fractions but not for all. Accounting for motion variability during treatment increases the PTV margins in all directions, most significantly in CC from 5 mm to 13.7 mm for lung and 8.0 mm for liver.Conclusion: Both short-term and day-to-day tumor motion variability can be significant, especially for lesions moving with amplitudes above 7 mm. Abandoning passive motion management strategies in favor of more active ones is advised. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Radiotherapy and Oncology 126 (2018) 339-346

PY  - 2019
AB  - — From the Parisian “worker gardens,” to the “community gardens” of New York going through Muscovite “vegetable squares”, these new ideas, aware of the emergency to reduce our fuel consumption and the necessity to modify our behavior facing the climatic changes. Looking for a positive energetic assessment, the contemporary city aims within fifteen years at producing cleanly and intensively more energy than it consumes. It develops energy by biomass, photovoltaic cells, green walls, green roofs and other renewable energies. The architecture has to be in the service of this new green issues and approaches. Green technology is the key issue to avoid these doomsday scenarios. It shows us that when different ideas inspired by the science of ecology are used as a source of imagery, it expands not only the communicative power of the building art, but their social relevance as well. The new ecological architecture is the architecture using building performance as a guiding design principle and adopting a new list of performance-based priorities for the design of cities, buildings, landscapes and infrastructures. This new kind of architecture places broadly defined performance above form-making; it utilizes the digital technologies of quantitative and qualitative performance-based simulation to offer a comprehensive new approach to the design of the built environment. In the historical development from static to dynamic perception of space there is always a change in the concept of architectural style. © GSTF 2019.

TI  - The measurement of visual efficiency standards for pilots in the United States Air Force
PY  - 1989
AB  - Military aviation requires a high degree of visual skill and efficiency. The current visual standards for flying status in the United States Air Force employ static tests of visual function. Visual factors utilized in flight are continually changing to meet the demands of the situation. This study evaluates the performance of two carefully matched samples of people on a test of dynamic visual change, i.e., vergence facility. We compared the ability of a sample of military pilots to make rapid fusional movements in a base-in and base-out direction with a group of nonpilots matched for other normal visual characteristics. The number of times each subject could reestablish fusion while viewing an anaglyph target through alternating 16Δ base-out and 4Δ base-in prism lenses was recorded over a 1-minute time interval. We found the pilot's ability to initiate and sustain fusional vergence movements to be similar to that of their nonrated military counterparts. Our work does not indicate that this test of visual efficiency would discriminate between the pilots and nonpilots in our sample if it were included in a test battery to identify individuals with exceptional visual proficiency.

TI  - The mechanics of a compliant motion suppression system for semisubmersibles
PY  - 1986
AB  - This paper describes experimental and theoretical work on a passive motion suppression system for semisubmersible vessels. The system incorporates a pneumatic compliancy which is designed to enhance the wave induced motion characteristics of such a vessel for offshore drilling and production service. The pneumatic compliancy is achieved through the use of open bottom tanks mounted on the vessel. The tanks pierce the water surface and trap a volume of air above their internal water level. During operation wave action on the tanks imparts an oscillating vertical force on the vessel which is 180 degrees out-of-phase with the inertia dominated wave induced heave force. As a result, vessel heave, roll and pitch motions are substantially reduced. Regular and irregular wave tests have been performed on a scale model enabling the motion reduction capabilities of such a system of be evaluated. Test data is compared with a multi-degree of freedom dynamic response calculation in the frequency domain in which the Morison equation is used for calculating wave induced drag and inertia loads on the semisubmersible. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the relative merits and drawbacks of incorporating a pneumatic compliancy into hitherto hydrodynamically rigid semisubmersible designs. © 1986.

TI  - The medial and lateral bellies of gastrocnemius: A cadaveric and ultrasound investigation
PY  - 2008
AB  - It is commonly reported that the medial belly (MG) of the. gastrocnemius muscle extends further distally than the lateral belly (LG). This observation is made in several standard anatomy texts with no explanation or quantitative data. In this study, the medial and lateral bellies of gastrocnemius in 45 embalmed cadavers were measured. The observed difference in length of the two bellies was found to be highly significant (mean difference in length = 1.74 cm, P < 0.001). In 8 out of 84 legs examined (9.5%), however, the MG was found to be shorter than the LG (three right legs, five left legs, bilateral in two individuals). Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the difference in muscle belly length in any individual and ipsilateral leg length or total body length, suggesting that the difference in belly length may be unrelated to biomechanical function. An ultrasound investigation into the activity pattern of the two bellies was carried out on five volunteers. Muscle activity was monitored during passive and active movements of the ankle and knee joints at different leg positions. During knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion, the LG contracted first in four of the five subjects, followed by the MG, then a period of either LG predomination or equal contraction. The fifth subject, who showed a reversed pattern of activity, had previously suffered an inversion injury of the ankle. We suggest that the initial activation of the LG may help to stabilize the ankle during plantarflexion. We found no evidence that gastrocnemius acts as a shunt muscle during distraction of the knee.

PY  - 2016
AB  - The Mesoamerican Corpus of Formative Period Art and Writing is a digital resource that will facilitate and robustly support research on the emergence of writing in the New World, and provide a suite of tools aimed to facilitate research on trends in anthropology. The goal of the project is to reveal the artistic and scribal traditions of the Olmec culture, Mesoamerica's first civilization and the originator of an ancestral sign system from which all later Mesoamerican writing developed. The Corpus assembles a database of Formative period (ca. 1500-400 BCE) Mesoamerican iconography and writing in a digital catalog accessible via intuitive and interactive web and mobile applications. This new suite of digital research tools, including an innovative visual-input search tool, is targeted to a broad range of users, from academic researchers to K-12 teachers and students. These tools allow users to compare, analyze, and visualize relationships among a broad corpus of visual data, archaeological materials, and conceptual information, and could be adapted for general access to complex data types such as 3D scans and landmark coordinates on bones. We envision the educational reach of The Mesoamerican Corpus of Formative Period Art and Writing surpassing the presentation of essays and static visual data to allow for the dynamic search, visualization, and investigation of a corpus of material currently only partially available in scattered sources with restricted access, such as small, regional Mexican museums.

AB  - Presents an obituary of Sir Henry Head (1861-1940). Henry Head was born of Quaker stock on 4 August 1861 at 6 Park Road, Stoke Newington. Henry Head was afflicted by Parkinsonism. With the first symptoms of Parkinsonism Henry Head retired from the London Hospital in 1919 and shortly afterwards, at the suggestion of Siegfried Sassoon, went to live in Dorset as the neighbor of Thomas Hardy at Max Gate. His mental faculties were well preserved: a year after retirement from The London Hospital his Studies in neurology (1920) was published, and he completed the two volumes of his highly esteemed Aphasia and kindred disorders of speech (1926), the last of his writings. He eschewed all drug therapy fearful that solanaceous drugs would impair his mind and relied for the treatment of his parkinsonism entirely on intensive, frequent passive movements which were given by two husky attendants. He died on 9 October 1940, "immobilised by illness, just able to talk, but mentally active". (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The mid-term results of proximal row carpectomy in the treatment of degenerative wrist joint derangements [Dejeneratif el bilegi eklemi patolojilerinin tedavisinde proksimal sira rezeksiyon artroplastisinin orta dönem sonuçlari.]
PY  - 2004
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the mid-term results of proximal row carpectomy (PRC) in patients who underwent treatment for wrist joint derangements. METHODS: Nine patients (4 men, 5 women; mean age 38 years; range 23 to 66 years) underwent PRC to relive pain in the wrist joint and to improve motion and grip strength. Indications for surgery were acute transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation in one patient, formerly unreduced perilunate fracture dislocation in one patient, Kienbock's disease in four patients, and scaphoid nonunion associated with scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) in three patients. The duration of the symptoms ranged from eight months to 10 years. The results were assessed with the use of pre- and postoperative clinical and radiographic studies, and measurements of active and passive motion, grip strength, and pulp and key pinch strengths. The mean follow-up was 35.4 months (range 13.5 to 72 months). RESULTS: Postoperatively, pain relief was achieved in all the patients and no complications were encountered in the early period. One patient with acute transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation developed radiocapitate joint degeneration three years after surgery and underwent total wrist arthrodesis. Compared to the uninvolved side, wrist functions were found adequate with painless motion, except for passive radial deviation which exhibited a significant decrease (p<0.05). Age, sex, and the duration of symptoms did not influence postoperative results. CONCLUSION: In selected patients with wrist joint derangement, PRC enables painless and adequate motion and grip strength for daily activities. However, radial styloidectomy seems to be necessary to prevent restriction in radial deviation.

TI  - The migration of fin whales into the southern Chukchi Sea as monitored with passive acoustics
PY  - 2016
AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) undergo seasonal migration in the Arctic Sea. Because their migration and distribution is likely affected by changes in global climate, we aimed to examine the migration timing of fin whales, and the relationship with prey availability within the oceanographic environment of the Arctic Sea, using passive and active acoustic monitoring methods. Automatic Underwater Sound Monitoring Systems were deployed in the southern Chukchi Sea from July 2012 to 2014 to determine the acoustic presence of fin whales. Furthermore, water temperature and salinity were recorded by a fixed data logger. An Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler was additionally deployed to estimate prey abundance through backscattering strength. Sea ice concentrations were obtained by remote sensing data. Fin whale calls were automatically detected using a custom-made software, and the per cent of half-hours containing calls were counted. Fin whale calls were detected from 4 August to 20 October 2012 (78 d) and 25 July to 1 November 2013 (100 d). The extended period of acoustic presence of fin whales during 2013 when compared with 2012 is likely related to a longer ice-free period during 2013. Furthermore, generalized linear model analyses showed that half-hour periods containing calls increased with a rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance during the initial call presence period, while they decreased with a decrease in water temperature and salinity during the end of the call presence period. Our results suggest that the rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance affect the timing of migration of fin whales in away that is consistent with the expansion of their suitable habitats and the extension of their presence in the Arctic Sea.

TI  - The missing link for attention pointers: Comment on Cavanagh &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;
PY  - 2010
AB  - Comments on an article by C. Cavanagh et al. (see record 2010-06403-002). The idea that visual stability might be mediated by an active mechanism that spatially updates object pointers has been around for some time. The authors proposed that it is the attention system that does the work. They suggest that feature information—perhaps the most critical aspect of spatiotopy—can be dealt with independently. They argued that these pointers do not provide any link to the target's identity, whereas in another section it is stated that ‘the properties that do transfer across saccades could be related to the maintenance of a link between the target's identity and its location. The critical missing link in their proposal is that there is no mechanism built into attention remapping that represents or tracks identity. They depend on attention as an all-powerful prime mover (in an otherwise passive visual system) rather than viewing attention as a phenomenon that must itself be explained. These debates are useful in reminding us of the increasing number of papers reporting spatiotopic, trans-saccadic perceptual effects and the importance of linking these findings with plausible neural mechanisms.

TI  - The motility of the child's wrist (6-16 years) (Czech)
PY  - 1974
AB  - Passive and, at a slower rate, active hyperextension proved to be decreasing between 6 and 16 yr (more in boys), while active flexion was increasing and passive flexion remained roughly unchanged. The decrease of hyperextension may be explained by toughening of the joint structure, and the increase of flexion by the prevailing flexion motions of the hand. Children of the lowest age class were found to have high averages of passive and active hyperextension, in contrast to flexion, which did not reach the expected values. At this age the motility of the wrist in the dorsal and volar direction proved to be identical (in adults there is reported more extensive flexion). Both these movements of the wrist decrease with age. Adduction in the supine position of the hand is about 3 times greater than abduction. Comparison of passive and active dorsovolar movements in the different sexes, particularly concerning their extent, indicate better ability of girls than boys to use the potential field for active movement. A similar situation may be observed in relation to age. Certain compensation of motility was found between both sides. Hyperextension was greater on the right, flexion on the left, so the dorsovolar motility of the right wrist was shifted to hyperextension compared with the left one. The range was identical on both sides and only lateral motion was slightly greater on the right (transferred from adduction). More extensive differentiation in motility between both sexes develops during adolescence. In all types of excursion higher averages were found in girls, as a consequence of age changes that are usually most marked about the 12th yr of age. The character of the wrist motility (age changes, sexual and side relations) differs from the joints of the thumb.

TI  - The motility of the thumb joints (6-16 years) (Czech)
PY  - 1974
AB  - The motility of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb (abduction, rotation, opposition) decreases with age and there are no clear differences between sexes and sides (only opposition was found to be 0.5 to 1.5° greater on the right and increased up to 10 to 12 yr, most probably due to the better ability of the older subject to perform the requested motion). The motility of the thumb differs from that of the 3 phalanx fingers not only in its absolute motility but also by the character of age related changes and by differences in the ratios of the sexes and the sides. This is due to the different functional properties of the thumb. Higher variability of all motions is also typical (being particularly high in the metacarpophalangeal joint). Passive and active hyperextension of both phalanges of the thumb proved to be high on the average in children, and distinctly higher variability of the index was found. The calculated data remain roughly at the same level (decreasing in the 3 phalanx fingers) in the examined range of 6 to 16 yr and they decrease only in the metacarpophalangeal joint in the period of adolescence. In flexion, a decrease of motion in relation with age was manifest (as against an increase in the long fingers), being more manifest in passive flexion and in boys (with the exception of the terminal phalanx where there was an increase in girls and also in the boys in the 5th class). These conditions are indicated in a figure, and typical curves for the flexion of long fingers are also presented. Side differences in passive and active flexion are usually small, hyperextension of the terminal phalanx is higher on the right, and that of the middle phalanx on the left (the difference in girls being always smaller and in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb irregular). A compensation of motility between the sides is thus suggested (similarly as in the long fingers, where the compensation is not complete however, and general motility is higher on the left). In the period of adolescence a marked differentiation in the dorsovolar motility between the sexes develops, all the types of the observed motions being larger in girls (in the 3 phalanx fingers this differentiation is smaller in the basal joints and only unclear in the interphalangeal joints). The girls were not found to be able to make better use of the possible range of movement than boys (i.e. the passive one) for active motion similarly as in the long fingers.

TI  - The movement-induced modulation in discriminability between cutaneous nonpainful stimuli depends on test stimulus intensity
PY  - 1994
AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out whether the finger movement-induced modulation of cutaneous discrimination thresholds varies with the intensity level of the test stimulation in various movement conditions. The effect of active and passive finger movement on cutaneous sensitivity to nonpainful electrical stimulation of threshold and suprathreshold intensity was studied in human subjects. The detection threshold and the just-noticeable amplitude difference (discrimination threshold) at two suprathreshold intensities (3× and 10× detection threshold) were determined using a forced-choice paradigm before and after (controls) or during finger movement. In one condition the stimuli were applied just prior to the movement. The finger was actively or passively moved at the frequency of 1.5 Hz or 3 Hz, and the test stimuli were applied to the moving finger, except in one condition to the contralateral finger. The contralateral condition was used to rule out vigilance- and attention-related mechanisms as a cause of sensitivity changes. Active as well as passive movement of the finger produced a significant increase in the detection threshold during the movement. Also just prior to the movement the detection threshold was increased. Suprathreshold discrimination thresholds in the moving finger were not significantly changed during or just prior to the active movement, whereas during passive movement the discrimination threshold to suprathreshold level stimulation was significantly decreased. When test stimuli were applied to the finger contralateral to the actively moving finger, neither the detection threshold nor the discrimination between stimuli of suprathreshold intensities were significantly changed. The results indicate that both active and passive movement can regionally suppress cutaneous sensitivity to threshold level stimuli, whereas discrimination between cutaneous stimuli of suprathreshold intensities can be improved or be unchanged during passive or active movement, respectively. The suppression of threshold level stimuli may be explained by both the activation of afferent-induced inhibition and corollary efferent barrage from motor to sensory areas of the brain, whereas afferent-induced mechanisms seem to have a predominant role in the improvement of discriminability between suprathreshold stimuli. The suppression of threshold sensitivity and the enhancement (or lack of suppression) of suprathreshold discriminability may be beneficial during movement allowing suppression of "noise" (e.g., skin receptor activation induced by moving finger) and allowing better discrimination of behaviorally relevant (suprathreshold) stimuli (e.g. discrimination of environmental stimuli during movement). © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The moving face during speech communication
PY  - 2013
AB  - It has been recognised for many years that viewing the face during auditory speech perception can influence phonetic categorisation. For example, under noisy conditions the face supplements the auditory signal and perceptual accuracy is increased (e.g. Sumby & Pollack, 1954). Even with clearly audible signals, viewing the face can modify the perceived place of articulation (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976) and perceived voicing categories of consonants (Green & Miller, 1985). Although static or configurational information (Fromkin, 1964; Abry & Boe, 1986; Badin et ai., 1994) contributes to this cross-modal effect, in this paper we focus on the dynamic characteristics of the moving face during speech (e.g. Rosenblum, 1994). In doing so, we try to establish what dynamic visual information is available and try to uncover its possible usefulness to the perceiver.

TI  - The moving rubber hand illusion revisited: Comparing movements and visuotactile stimulation to induce illusory ownership
PY  - 2014
AB  - The rubber hand illusion is a perceptual illusion in which a model hand is experienced as part of one's own body. In the present study we directly compared the classical illusion, based on visuotactile stimulation, with a rubber hand illusion based on active and passive movements. We examined the question of which combinations of sensory and motor cues are the most potent in inducing the illusion by subjective ratings and an objective measure (proprioceptive drift). In particular, we were interested in whether the combination of afferent and efferent signals in active movements results in the same illusion as in the purely passive modes. Our results show that the illusion is equally strong in all three cases. This demonstrates that different combinations of sensory input can lead to a very similar phenomenological experience and indicates that the illusion can be induced by any combination of multisensory information.

TI  - The natural discharges of Purkinje cells in paravermal regions of lobules V and VI of the monkey's cerebellum
PY  - 1977
AB  - 1. Conscious monkeys were trained with food rewards to perform movement tasks with the left hand and to accept manipulation of the joints and muscles and natural non‐noxious stimulation of the skin of both forelimbs. 2. Recordings were made from 230 Purkinje cells situated in the paravermal region of lobules V and VI or immediately adjacent folia of the left cerebellum in a region from 2 to 7 mm from the mid line. These neurones were all in a zone which was demonstrated to receive inputs from the ipsilateral hand and which is known to receive projections, via the pontine nuclei from the ‘arm area’ of motor cortex in the right hemisphere. 3. Modulation of the natural activity of 182 of these 230 Purkinje cells (79%) occurred in a reproducible manner in temporal association, each with a particular phase of the self‐paced movement tasks performed by the animal using the ipsilateral arm and hand. The patterns of modulation of Purkinje cell firing in this limited zone of cerebellar cortex could be classified into one of four groups, and each cell's discharge was associated with a particular aspect of movement such as general arm flexion, shoulder retraction, elbow extension or elbow flexion whenever it occurred. 4. The cells were spontaneously active at rest. Most commonly, marked accelerations of the discharge were related to one direction of the particular aspect of movement and a reduction of activity or even total silence accompanied movement in the opposite direction. 5. Variation of the amount of discharge demonstrated during a movement performance with which this discharge was characteristically associated could be related to the range of the movement or its duration, more activity being characteristic of more prolonged movement performance through larger angles of joint displacement. 6. Both simple spikes and complex spikes of some cells showed characteristic modulation of their activity during the monkey's self‐initiated movements. Cells whose simple spikes did not change in frequency during the movement task, also showed no modification of complex spike discharge. 7. Of the 182 neurones whose discharges changed during active movement performance, 105 (roughly 60%) were demonstrated to be in receipt of an input from peripheral receptors in the hand which could be activated by brisk tapping of the skin or brushing of hairs. In contrast, none of the Purkinje cells whose discharges were unchanged during arm movements could be demonstrated to receive such an input. 8. Movement of joints through their full range and prodding of muscles were completely ineffective stimuli for causing changes in Purkinje cell firing in this zone of the cerebellar cortex while the animal was passive and relaxed. Imposed perturbations of movement performance injected unexpectedly during the execution of a movement task were also ineffective in modifying the discharge of these Purkinje cells in relation to the task. © 1977 The Physiological Society

TI  - The neural bases underlying pitch processing difficulties
PY  - 2009
AB  - Normal listeners are often surprisingly poor at processing pitch changes. The neural bases of this difficulty were explored using magnetoencephalography (MEG) by comparing participants who obtained poor thresholds on a pitch-direction task with those who obtained good thresholds. Source-space projected data revealed that during an active listening task, the poor threshold group displayed greater activity in the left auditory cortical region when determining the direction of small pitch glides, whereas there was no difference in the good threshold group. In a passive listening task, a mismatch response (MMNm) was identified for pitch-glide direction deviants, with a tendency to be smaller in the poor listeners. The results imply that the difficulties in pitch processing are already apparent during automatic sound processing, and furthermore suggest that left hemisphere auditory regions are used by these listeners to consciously determine the direction of a pitch change. This is in line with evidence that the left hemisphere has a poor frequency resolution, and implies that normal listeners may use the sub-optimal hemisphere to process pitch changes.

TI  - The neural basis of hallucinations and delusions
PY  - 2005
AB  - Schizophrenia is a biologically based disorder characterised by false perceptions (hallucinations) and false beliefs (delusions). The underlying physiological cause of these mental abnormalities remains unknown. There is increasing evidence that one class of symptom, the 'made experiences' including delusions of alien control and thought insertion, is associated with abnormalities in the mechanism that predicts the outcome of intended actions (the forward model). For these patients active movements feel like passive movements. As a result these patients do not feel in control of their actions. However, comparison with various neurological disorders, such as those associated with parietal lobe lesions, suggest that this abnormal experience is not sufficient to explain the feeling that some other agent is controlling is one's actions. Preliminary evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia have an exaggerated sense of agency. In combination with the feeling of not being in control, this exaggerated sense of agency could explain delusions of alien control in which the patient attributes his own actions to another agent. Little is yet know about the neural basis of the predictive mechanisms that create the feeling that we are in control of our movements. Such prediction requires integration of information about intended movements generated in frontal cortex with sensory. processing in posterior regions of the brain. Measures of functional connectivity suggest that long-range interactions between frontal and posterior regions are abnormally reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to explore the precise involvement of long-range connections in the mechanisms of forward modelling. (C) 2004 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS.

TI  - The neural encoding of self-generated and externally applied movement: implications for the perception of self-motion and spatial memory.
PY  - 2014
AB  - The vestibular system is vital for maintaining an accurate representation of self-motion. As one moves (or is moved) toward a new place in the environment, signals from the vestibular sensors are relayed to higher-order centers. It is generally assumed the vestibular system provides a veridical representation of head motion to these centers for the perception of self-motion and spatial memory. In support of this idea, evidence from lesion studies suggests that vestibular inputs are required for the directional tuning of head direction cells in the limbic system as well as neurons in areas of multimodal association cortex. However, recent investigations in monkeys and mice challenge the notion that early vestibular pathways encode an absolute representation of head motion. Instead, processing at the first central stage is inherently multimodal. This minireview highlights recent progress that has been made towards understanding how the brain processes and interprets self-motion signals encoded by the vestibular otoliths and semicircular canals during everyday life. The following interrelated questions are considered. What information is available to the higher-order centers that contribute to self-motion perception? How do we distinguish between our own self-generated movements and those of the external world? And lastly, what are the implications of differences in the processing of these active vs. passive movements for spatial memory?

TI  - The neural influence on the occurrence of locomotor-respiratory coordination
PY  - 2010
AB  - This study focused on the neurogenic mechanisms of coordination between locomotor and respiratory rhythms. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of peripheral neurogenic drive from moving limbs, and the level of consciousness, on locomotor-respiratory coordination. Subjects performed movement for 20 min in a supine position using a bicycle ergometer. The movement comprised three types of leg movements: active (loadless) movement, passive movement while awake and passive movement during sleep. We found no difference between active and passive movement in the degree of coordination. However, the degree of coordination during sleep was significantly lower than that while awake (p < 0.05). We conclude that peripheral neurogenic drive from moving limbs is able to generate locomotor-respiratory coordination, and that the level of consciousness may influence the degree of coordination.

TI  - The neural response to emotional prosody, as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging
PY  - 2003
AB  - Prosody is an important feature of language, comprising intonation, loudness, and tempo. Emotional prosodic processing forms an integral part of our social interactions. The main aim of this study was to use bold contrast fMRI to clarify the normal functional neuroanatomy of emotional prosody, in passive and active contexts. Subjects performed six separate scanning studies, within which two different conditions were contrasted: (1) "pure" emotional prosody versus rest; (2) congruent emotional prosody versus 'neutral' sentences; (3) congruent emotional prosody versus rest; (4) incongruent emotional prosody versus rest; (5) congruent versus incongruent emotional prosody; and (6) an active experiment in which subjects were instructed to either attend to the emotion conveyed by semantic content or that conveyed by tone of voice. Data resulting from these contrasts were analysed using SPM99. Passive listening to emotional prosody consistently activated the lateral temporal lobe (superior and/or middle temporal gyri). This temporal lobe response was relatively right-lateralised with or without semantic information. Both the separate and direct comparisons of congruent and incongruent emotional prosody revealed that subjects used fewer brain regions to process incongruent emotional prosody than congruent. The neural response to attention to semantics, was left lateralised, and recruited an extensive network not activated by attention to emotional prosody. Attention to emotional prosody modulated the response to speech, and induced right-lateralised activity, including the middle temporal gyrus. In confirming the results of lesion and neuropsychological studies, the current study emphasises the importance of the right hemisphere in the processing of emotional prosody, specifically the lateral temporal lobes.

TI  - The non-equilibrium nature of active motion
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this contribution chapter, the non-equilibrium nature of active motion is explored in the framework of the Generalized Langevin Equation. The persistence effects that distinguish active motion, observed in a variety of biological organisms and man-made colloidal particles, from the passive one, are put in correspondence with the memory function that characterizes the retarded dissipative effects in the equation. The non-equilibrium aspects of this approach rely on the relaxation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, that couples the memory function with the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force in order to describe the equilibrium. In the case of freely diffusing active particles, the Fokker-Planck equation is derived and an effective temperature can be identified if the total overlap between the deterministic solutions of the Generalized Langevin Equation at two times, weighted by the noise correlation function, exists and is finite. Active motion confined by the harmonic, external potential is analyzed on the same framework leading to analogous conclusions.

TI  - The novel nootropic compound DM232 (UNIFIRAM) ameliorates memory impairment in mice and rats
PY  - 2002
AB  - The favorable pharmacological profile exhibited by piracetam stimulated the synthesis of related compounds potentially endowed with a higher nootropic potency. The antiamnesic and procognitive activity of DM232 (unifiram), a new compound structurally related to piracetam, was investigated. Mouse passive avoidance and rat Morris water maze and Social learning tests were employed. DM232 (0.001-1 mg kg(-1) i.p. - 0.01-0.1 1 mg kg(-1) p.o.) prevented amnesia induced by scopolamine (1.5 mg kg(-1) i.p.), mecamylamine (20 mg kg(-1) i.p.), baclofen (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.), and clonidine (0.125 mg kg(-1) i.p.). Furthermore, The antiamnesic effect of the investigated compound was comparable to that exerted by well-known nootropic drugs such as piracetam (30-100 mg kg(-1) i.p.), aniracetam (100 mg kg(-1) p.o.), rolipram (30 mg kg(-1) p.o.), and nicotine (5 mg kg(-1) i.p). DM232 (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was also able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.8 mg kg(-1) i.p.) in the rat Morris watermaze test. In the rat social learning test, DM232 (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) injected in adults rats reduced the duration of active exploration of the familiar partner in the second session of the test. DM232, similarly to piracetam, reduced the duration of hypnosis induced by pentobarbital. At the highest effective doses, the investigated compound did not impair motor coordination (rota rod test), nor modified spontaneous (Animex). These results indicate DM232 (unifiram) as a novel cognition enhancer, strictly related to piracetam-like compounds, able to ameliorate memory impairment at doses about 1,000 times lower than the most active available nootropic compounds.

TI  - The nucleus of the optic tract. Its function in gaze stabilization and control of visual-vestibular interaction.
PY  - 1992
AB  - 1. Electrical stimulation of the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) induced nystagmus and after-nystagmus with ipsilateral slow phases. The velocity characteristics of the nystagmus were similar to those of the slow component of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and to optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN), both of which are produced by velocity storage in the vestibular system. When NOT was destroyed, these components disappeared. This indicates that velocity storage is activated from the visual system through NOT. 2. Velocity storage produces compensatory eye-in-head and head-on-body movements through the vestibular system. The association of NOT with velocity storage implies that NOT helps stabilize gaze in space during both passive motion and active locomotion in light with an angular component. It has been suggested that "vestibular-only" neurons in the vestibular nuclei play an important role in generation of velocity storage. Similarities between the rise and fall times of eye velocity during OKN and OKAN to firing rates of vestibular-only neurons suggest that these cells may receive their visual input through NOT. 3. One NOT was injected with muscimol, a GABAA agonist. Ipsilateral OKN and OKAN were lost, suggesting that GABA, which is an inhibitory transmitter in NOT, acts on projection pathways to the brain stem. A striking finding was that visual suppression and habituation of contralateral slow phases of vestibular nystagmus were also abolished after muscimol injection. The latter implies that NOT plays an important role in producing visual suppression of the VOR and habituating its time constant. 4. Habituation is lost after nodulus and uvula lesions and visual suppression after lesions of the flocculus and paraflocculus. We postulate that the disappearance of vestibular habituation and of visual suppression of vestibular responses after muscimol injections was due to dysfacilitation of the prominent NOT-inferior olive pathway, inactivating climbing fibers from the dorsal cap to nodulouvular and flocculoparafloccular Purkinje cells. The prompt loss of habituation when NOT was inactivated, and its return when the GABAergic inhibition dissipated, suggests that although VOR habituation can be relatively permanent, it must be maintained continuously by activity of the vestibulocerebellum.

TI  - The nucleus prepositus predominantly outputs eye movement-related information during passive and active self-motion
PY  - 2013
AB  - Dale A, Cullen KE. The nucleus prepositus predominantly outputs eye movement-related information during passive and active self-motion. J Neurophysiol 109: 1900-1911, 2013. First published January 16, 2013; doi:10.1152/jn.00788.2012.-Maintaining a constant representation of our heading as we move through the world requires the accurate estimate of spatial orientation. As one turns (or is turned) toward a new heading, signals from the semicircular canals are relayed through the vestibular system to higher-order centers that encode head direction. To date, there is no direct electrophysiological evidence confirming the first relay point of head-motion signals from the vestibular nuclei, but previous anatomical and lesion studies have identified the nucleus prepositus as a likely candidate. Whereas burst-tonic neurons encode only eye-movement signals during head-fixed eye motion and passive vestibular stimulation, these neurons have not been studied during self-generated movements. Here, we specifically address whether burst-tonic neurons encode head motion during active behaviors. Single-unit responses were recorded from the nucleus prepositus of rhesus monkeys and compared for head-restrained and active conditions with comparable eye velocities. We found that neurons consistently encoded eye position and velocity across conditions but did not exhibit significant sensitivity to head position or velocity. Additionally, response sensitivities varied as a function of eye velocity, similar to abducens motoneurons and consistent with their role in gaze control and stabilization. Thus our results demonstrate that the primate nucleus prepositus chiefly encodes eye movement even during active head-movement behaviors, a finding inconsistent with the proposal that this nucleus makes a direct contribution to head-direction cell tuning. Given its ascending projections, however, we speculate that this eye-movement information is integrated with other inputs in establishing higher-order spatial representations.

TI  - The optimal orthosis and motion protocol for extensor tendon injury in zones IV-VIII: A systematic review
PY  - 2017
AB  - Study Design: Systematic reviewIntroduction: There exist numerous combinations of orthoses and motion protocols for the treatment of proximal extensor tendon injuries.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal combination of motion protocol and orthotic treatment for the rehabilitation of proximal extensor tendon injuries (zones IV-VIM.Methods: A systematic review of English language randomized clinical trials and cohort studies investigating extensor tendon rehabilitation from 1960 to 2016 was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PEDro, and OTseeker. Outcomes of total active motion, grip strength, return to work, patient attrition, and patient-reported outcomes were compared.Results: Eleven studies of predominantly average quality (1, low; 8, average; and 2, high) were included in the final review. Results were difficult to compare due to differences in reporting. Early total active motion and final grip strength were greater with dynamic extension orthoses (191 -214; 35-38 kg/89% contralateral side) and relative motion orthoses (205-236 degrees; 85%-95% contralateral side) compared to static orthoses (79 degrees-202 degrees : 23-34 kg/59% contralateral side). Four studies excluded patients who did not follow up, and loss to follow-up was 12%-33% in the other studies. Patient-reported outcomes were not comparable, as they were only included in 3 studies, and each used a different assessment tool.Conclusion: Average quality evidence supports the use of early active motion (EAM) as the superior motion protocol, but optimal orthosis to deliver EAM could not be determined. Prospective research should focus on patient -reported outcomes and the design of orthoses that facilitate the use of the EAM. (C) 2017 Hanley & Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The outcome of intra-articular distal radius fractures treated with fragment-specific fixation
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: To assess the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcome of treating intra-articular distal radius fractures with fragment-specific fixation.Methods: A retrospective review of 81 patients with 85 intra-articular distal radius fractures who were treated with fragment-specific fixation was performed. Minimum time to follow-up evaluation was 1 year, with a mean time of 32 months. The immediate postoperative films were compared with those taken at the final follow-up evaluation. Radiographs of the uninjured wrist were also obtained at the final follow-up evaluation for comparison. Patients were examined for wrist and finger range of motion, deformity, and grip strength, and they completed a standard Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcome survey.Results: According to Gartland and Werley scoring there were 61 excellent and 24 good results. Flexion and extension of the surgically treated wrist at the final follow-up evaluation averaged 85% and 91%, respectively, of the uninjured wrist; grip strength averaged 92% compared with the uninjured side. The average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcome score for the injured wrist was 9. Sixty-two percent of patients achieved a 100 degrees arc of flexion and extension and normal forearm rotation by postoperative week 6. Radiographic alignment was maintained between immediate postoperative and final follow-up films, and there were no cases of symptomatic arthritis at the final follow-up evaluation.Conclusions: Fragment-specific fixation is a reasonable alternative for treating intra-articular fractures of the distal radius. At final follow-up evaluations, patients had good to excellent results with respect to range of motion, grip strength, radiographic alignment, and satisfaction scores. Stable fixation allowed starting active and passive motion of the wrist without compromising postoperative alignment.

TI  - The outcome of the straight leg raise (SLR) is reduced after a brain lesion
PY  - 2016
AB  - Relevance: Neurodynamic tests such as the straight leg raise (SLR) test are widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, the validity of these tests has not been proven yet in patients suffering from a brain lesion although increased mechanosensitivity is assumed to frequently occur secondary to a brain lesion. Purpose(s): The overarching goal of the present work was to improve physiotherapeutic diagnosis in patients with central nervous system (CNS) lesion with respect to detecting changes of mechanosensitive properties. Therefore, feasibility of SLR testing in addition to establishing first baseline values for the SLR within this specific patient group were the goals of this study. Methods/analysis: Prior to the main study, raters were trained in standardized testing and evaluating verbal and non-verbal signs of discomfort to define end of passive range of motion (ROM). High intra- and inter-rater validity (ICC > .90) was established. n = 115 patients (46 females, mean age = 64.3 years, range 20 to 90 years) were recruited after discharge from intensive medical care at admission to the rehabilitation centre. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of a CNS lesion of traumatic or cerebrovascular cause. Exclusion criteria were other diseases of the central or peripheral nervous system, intolerance to the supine test position, high motoric agitation level, and medical reasons impeding passive movement of the lower limb. Age-matched volunteers without diagnosis of neurological diseases served as control group. In a first step, a linear regression model was used to analyse the effect of predictor variables GROUP (patient, control), GENDER, AGE, and SIDE on the primary endpoint (SLR range of motion, ROM-SLR). In a second step, the predictive value of time since lesion, level of paresis, and level of active mobility was analysed in the patient alone. Result(s): Compared to healthy controls, a marked decrease of on average-30degree ROM-SLR was found in the patient group (P < .0001) independent of SIDE. Selective analysis of the patient group showed that reduction of ROM-SLR was independent of level of severity of the paresis or time since lesion. However, higher level of active mobility served as predictor for better ROM-SLR (P < .01). Discussion and conclusions: Although, pain reactions cannot be fully excluded in patients unable to verbally communicate, the present data show for the first time that the SLR is a feasible and valid test for patients with CNS lesion. The present results show a clear reduction of ROM-SLR in patients already in the subacute phase compared to agematched controls, indicating an early dramatic loss of passive range of motion. These findings support the hypothesis of a peripheral neuropathy secondary to the CNS lesion. We found an association between less reduced ROM-SLR and better active mobility of body and extremities. Impact and implications: We propose the SLR as a standard test to evaluate and monitor the passive ROM in the rehabilitation of patients with CNS lesions. Future work needs to address the underlying mechanisms and the impact of sensorimotor rehabilitation on the development of ROMSLR.

TI  - The painful shoulder
PY  - 1977
AB  - The shoulder, a very common site of pain syndromes in medical practice, lends itself well to precise clinical analysis and identification of the pain-sensitive structure or structures. Once identified, rational and effective management can be applied, associated with predictably good prognosis. Early identification of the emerging specific syndrome is important in decreasing the duration of the clinical disorder and in achieving optimum return of shoulder function. Laboratory and X-ray studies are not commonly requined in diagnosis and management. There are a confusing variety of names attached to the many shoulder pain syndromes; however, there are two most common categories. One is associated with severe pain but little or no limitation of shoulder movement (at least passive movement), in which the pain-sensitive structure is tendon or tendon sheath; the other is associated with both pain and limitation of active and passive motion, in which the pain-sensitive structures are capsule, bursa, and synovium as well as muscle and multiple tendons. © 1977 Grune & Stratton, Inc., Publishers.

TI  - The partial use of Guyon's canal for opponensplasty
PY  - 1998
AB  - We used the proximal one third of Guyon's canal as a pulley while performing oppenensplasty. The preparation of the pulley can performed easily in this technique that allows the maximal use of passive motion of the thumb by the easy slide of the tendon. Eleven oppenensplasties has been performed with this method in ten patients. Lumbrical replacement was also performed in five of these patients due to to clawing. No complications were recorded in the observation period after the operations. The active opposition and the passive movement of the thumb were evaluated after operations. There was no difference in these motions. Moreover, the abduction and the flexion of the thumb were more stable and equal due to the localization of the pulley. It was concluded that the use of the proximal one third of Guyon's canal as a pulley allows the maximal use of passive motion capacity of the thumb.

TI  - The passive properties of muscle fibers are velocity dependent
PY  - 2014
AB  - The passive properties of skeletal muscle play an important role in muscle function. While the passive quasi-static elastic properties of muscle fibers have been well characterized, the dynamic visco-elastic passive behavior of fibers has garnered less attention. In particular, it is unclear how the visco-elastic properties are influenced by lengthening velocity, in particular for the range of physiologically relevant velocities. The goals of this work were to: (i) measure the effects of lengthening velocity on the peak stresses within single muscle fibers to determine how passive behavior changes over a range of physiologically relevant lengthening rates (0.1-10L(o)/s), and (ii) develop a mathematical model of fiber viscoelasticity based on these measurements. We found that passive properties depend on strain rate, in particular at the low loading rates (0.1-3L(o)/s), and that the measured behavior can be predicted across a range of loading rates and time histories with a quasi-linear viscoelastic model. In the future, these results can be used to determine the impact of viscoelastic behavior on intramuscular stresses and forces during a variety of dynamic movements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The patello-femoral pain syndrome: A clinical trial of the McConnell programme
PY  - 1989
AB  - In an uncontrolled clinical trial, 116 patients from a general population were treated with the McConnell programme for patello-femoral pain syndrome. This programme, consisting of a detailed knee assessment and treatment using a taping technique for pain relief, isometric and eccentric exercise, produced excellent to good results in 86 per cent of patients within five treatments and maintained those results one year after the cessation of treatment. Sex, current activities, duration of symptoms, abnormal foot pronation, iliotibial tract and hamstring tightness and other positive passive movement tests had no effect on the outcome of the treatment. Patients over 38 years of age had only an equal chance of being painfree with five treatments. The presence of concurrent lumbar symptoms increased the time required for positive response to the treatment (p < 0.001).

TI  - The peculiarities of vertebral and muscular tonic syndromes in acute and remote periods of whip cervical trauma
PY  - 2004
AB  - The study elicited the peculiarities of vertebral and muscular tonic syndromes in acute and remote periods of whip cervical trauma (WCT). Forty patients in acute period of WCT (2(nd) -3(rd) degree of severity) and 30 patients in remote period of WCT, who experienced pain and other symptoms 6 months after the trauma (late whip syndrome - LWS) were examined. The control group included 30 patients with neck and arm pain due to cervical osteochondrosis. in WCT, comparing to cervical osteochondrosis, more marked movement restriction in sagittal plane, more frequent blockade of the lower cervical spine segments, stronger correlation between pain syndrome and movement restriction in the cervical segments, more frequent muscular tonic syndrome in the anterior neck muscles and deeper neck flexors were found. In LWS, in contrast to the acute period of WCT, dissociation between more restricted active and more preserved passive movements in the cervical segments, weaker correlation between emerging of pain syndrome and restriction of movement volume, more frequent blockade of the upper cervical segments, more frequent occurrence of supraspinal muscles and shoulder-scapular syndromes were detected. The data obtained revealed a complex mechanism of symptoms formation in WCT that should be taken into account in treatment planning for acute and remote periods of cervical trauma.

TI  - The perception of spatial layout in real and virtual worlds
PY  - 1997
AB  - As human-machine interfaces grow more immersive and graphically-oriented, virtual environment systems become more prominent as the medium for human-machine communication. Often, virtual environments (VE) are built to provide exact metrical representations of existing or proposed physical spaces. However, it is not known how individuals develop representational models of these spaces in which they are immersed and how those models may be distorted with respect to both the virtual and real-world equivalents. To evaluate the process of model development, the present experiment examined participant's ability to reproduce a complex spatial layout of objects having experienced them previously under different viewing conditions. The layout consisted of nine common objects arranged on a flat plane. These objects could be viewed in a free binocular virtual condition, a free binocular real-world condition, and in a static monocular view of the real world. The first two allowed active exploration of the environment while the latter condition allowed the participant only a passive opportunity to observe from a single viewpoint. Viewing conditions were a between-subject variable with 10 participants randomly assigned to each condition. Performance was assessed using mapping accuracy and triadic comparisons of relative inter-object distances. Mapping results showed a significant effect of viewing condition where, interestingly, the static monocular condition was superior to both the active virtual and real binocular conditions. Results for the triadic comparisons showed a significant interaction for gender by viewing condition in which males were more accurate than females. These results suggest that the situation model resulting from interaction with a virtual environment was indistinguishable from interaction with real objects at least within the constraints of the present procedure.

TI  - The perception of surface roughness by active and passive touch

AB  - Subjects made magnitude estimates of the roughness of metal gratings by both active and passive touch (with object movement). The perceived magnitude of surface roughness and the consistency of such judgments were identical under the two modes of tactual examination. The results have implications for sensory physiology studies of the cutaneous peripheral mechanisms that underlie texture. They also question the prevailing notion in somethesis and tactual perception that active touch is always superior to passive touch. © 1981, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - The physiological demands of elite single-handed dinghy sailing.
PY  - 2004
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the physiological demands of elite single-handed dinghy racing by using a combination of on-water measures and simulations in the laboratory using sports specific sailing ergometers.  The end goals were to establish the physical demands of the sport and the anthropometric and physiological characteristics required for success at the elite level, and offer appropriate assessment and training regimens.  This work is aimed at changing practice based on scientific evidence rather than on belief. On-water data, reported in chapter 4, was unanimous in establishing that the physical demands increased as wind speed increased and that upwind sailing was more strenuous than downwind sailing.  Heart rate and blood lactates (Labl) averaged 84% HRmax and 4.64 mmol.l-1 and 78% HRmax and 3.35 mmol.l-1 for Laser and Finn sailing in strong (9-15 m.s-1) and moderate winds (5-9 m.s-1) respectively.  It has been suggested the elevated heart rates are caused by the isometric contractions involved with hiking, and is a misleading indicator of the overall energy demands.  Chapter 5 investigated the physiological responses to a static 30 minute laboratory simulation of hiking. Blood pressure (BP) was markedly elevated peaking at 166/95 mmHg and hyperventilation was evident.  But in spite of significant muscular discomfort, with rates of perceived exertion peaking at 15.3, HR and VO2 remained low and peaked at 101 ± 9 beats.min-1 and 7.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 respectively.  These results replicate the responses of isometric exercise reported in the sailing literature, and suggest that other mechanisms are responsible for the elevated values reported on the water. Chapter 6 describes 30 minutes of simulated upwind sailing, on a purpose built Laser sailing ergometer, and was designed to mimic the dynamic movements of competitive sport.  The main findings saw mean HRpeak of 160 beats.min-1 (87.4% Hrmax),  mean VO2 of 32.2 ± 3.0 ml.kg-1.min-1 (58.1% VO2max), final Labl of 4.47 ± 0.23 mmol.l-1.  Ventilatory equivalents for oxygen were higher than those obtained during a maximal cycle ergometer test, providing evidence of hyperventilation.  This hyperventilation may indicate that even a dynamic simulation of single-handed sailing has an underpinning isometric contraction of the quadriceps and/or abdominals on which are superimposed a range of dynamic movements that typifies elite sailing.  These results have been confirmed in a recent (2004) on-water study of elite French Laser sailors (Castagna and Brisswalter) when peak values of 78.5% HRmax and 68.4% VOmax after 30 minutes of hiking were reported.  It is argued that these elevated values indicate that the sport has elements of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.  However, it seems that the competence level of the sailor and the duration of the hiking action are important factors considered.

Based on experience gained at the Central Advisory Board of Sports Physicians, Leipzig, from the treatment of 20 sportsmen with lesions of the Achilles tendon, the author deals with all forms of physiotherapy, e.g., hydrotherapy, iontophoresis, classical massage, connective tissue and underwater massage, and active and passive movement cures. The author emphasizes the importance of isometric muscle training from the viewpoint of rupture prophylaxis and in the framework of early postoperative movement cure.

TI  - The pianist’s hand: Anthropometry and biomechanics
PY  - 1988
AB  - The aim of the study was to obtain an overall view of the extent of variation in hand size and joint mobility in professional pianists. Twenty dimensions of hand size, 17 ranges of active movement and 11 features of passive joint mobility were tested on both hands of 127 male pianists aged between 17 and 63 and 111 female pianists aged between 16 and 64. The male hand showed significantly higher mean values than the female hand in all absolute hand-size variables with the exception of fingertip prominence 3–5. The lateral differences were numerically slight, although occasionally significant; the variability of hand-shape dimensions, except in the case of finger-tip prominence, was less than 10%. All mean values of finger spans with the thumb were greater in men than in women. The same tendency prevailed in the case of finger spans without the thumb, although the differences were only occasionally significant. Five of the 20 finger spans were on average significantly greater on the left than on the right. The rest of the ranges of active movement (flexion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint, wrist abduction and forearm pronosupination) were greater on average in the women. The variability in ranges of active movement was between 5% and 26%. With regard to passive mobility, significantly higher mean values for all characteristics were apparent in the women and, with one exception, there were significantly higher values for the left hand. The variability here ranged between 11% and 38%. A weak negative correlation prevailed between joint mobility and age. This was only calculated for the male pianists. The corresponding characteristics in the right and left hand were highly correlated, whereas the characteristics within one hand were, on the whole, weakly correlated. Out of 1512 intercorrelations, 1387 coefficients were below 0·6. There was a conspicuous frequency of negative relationships between hand-size factors and mobility. There was a tendency for greater mobility in pianists than in non-musicians. The question of the relevance of data on hand size and mobility when data on muscle strength are lacking is discussed. The possibilities of the practical use of the available data for the assessment of the manual aptitude of a pianist are illustrated by means of a biomechanical hand profile and the significance of the data for keyboard design in general is pointed out. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The potential for regeneration of articular cartilage in defects created by chondral shaving and subchondral abrasion
PY  - 1991
AB  - Animal models for chondral shaving and subchondral abrasion were created to resolve the controversy about the nature of the repair tissue after these procedures and to determine the effect of continuous passive motion on the quality of the repair tissue. Chondral shaving was performed on the patella in forty adolescent rabbits, and subchondral abrasion was performed on the patella in another forty rabbits. In both procedures, a three-millimeter-diameter defect was created. After the operation, twenty animals from each group were allowed intermittent active motion; the remainder were treated by continuous passive motion for two weeks, followed by intermittent active motion. Half of the animals from each group were killed at four weeks and the other half, at twelve weeks. There was no evidence of repair tissue in the defects at either four or twelve weeks after chondral shaving, regardless of the postoperative treatment. The remaining underlying cartilage, however, had degenerated. After abrasion of subchondral bone, the defects in animals that were treated with only intermittent active motion healed at twelve weeks, although the quality of the repair tissue varied. All ten of the animals that were treated with continuous passive motion, however, had mature, hyaline-like cartilage as the predominant repair tissue at twelve weeks, compared with six of the ten animals that were treated with intermittent active motion (p less than 0.05). We concluded that, in this model, partial-thickness defects created by chondral shaving do not heal; rather, the remaining underlying cartilage degenerates. Full-thickness defects created by subchondral abrasion can heal by regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage. Such healing is enhanced by continuous passive motion for two weeks postoperatively.

TI  - The potential natural vegetation of large river floodplains – From dynamic to static equilibrium
PY  - 2020
AB  - The potential natural vegetation (PNV) is a useful benchmark for the restoration of large river floodplains because very few natural reference reaches exist. Expert-based approaches and different types of ecological models (static and dynamic) are commonly used for its estimation despite the conceptual differences they imply. For natural floodplains a static concept of PNV is not reasonable, as natural disturbances cause a constant resetting of succession. However, various forms of river regulation have disrupted the natural dynamics of most large European rivers for centuries. Therefore, we asked whether the consideration of succession dynamics and time dependent habitat turnover are still relevant factors for the reconstruction of the PNV. To answer this we compared the results of a simulation of the vegetation succession (1872–2016) of a segment of the upper Rhine river after regulation (damming, straightening and bank protection) to different statistic and expert-based modelling approaches for PNV reconstruction. The validation of the different PNV estimation methods against a set of independent reference plots and the direct comparison of their results revealed very similar performances. We therefore conclude that due to a lack of large disturbances, the vegetation of regulated large rivers has reached a near-equilibrium state with the altered hydrologic regime and that a static perception of its PNV may be justified. Consequently, statistical models seem to be the best option for its reconstruction since they need relatively few resources (data, time, expert knowledge) and are reproducible. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - The predictive value of aptitude assessment in laparoscopic surgery: a meta-analysis
PY  - 2016
AB  - ContextCurrent methods of assessing candidates for medical specialties that involve laparoscopic skills suffer from a lack of instruments to assess the ability to work in a minimally invasive surgery environment.ObjectivesA meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether aptitude assessment can be used to predict variability in the acquisition and performance of laparoscopic skills.MethodsPubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched to November 2014 for published and unpublished studies reporting the measurement of a form of aptitude for laparoscopic skills. The quality of studies was assessed with QUADAS-2. Summary correlations were calculated using a random-effects model.ResultsThirty-four studies were found to be eligible for inclusion; six of these studies used an operating room performance measurement. Laparoscopic skills correlated significantly with visual-spatial ability (r=0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.39; p<0.001), perceptual ability (r=0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.39; p<0.001), psychomotor ability (r=0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.40; p=0.003) and simulator-based assessment of aptitude (r=0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.73; p<0.001). Three-dimensional dynamic visual-spatial ability showed a significantly higher correlation than intrinsic static visual-spatial ability (p=0.024).ConclusionsIn general, aptitude assessments are associated with laparoscopic skill level. Simulator-based assessment of aptitude appears to have the potential to represent a job sample and to enable the assessment of all forms of aptitude for laparoscopic surgery at once. A laparoscopy aptitude test can be a valuable additional tool in the assessment of candidates for medical specialties that require laparoscopic skills.Discuss ideas arising from the article at discuss.

TI  - The primate subthalamic nucleus. I. Functional properties in intact animals
PY  - 1994
AB  - 1. The present study tests several key aspects of the current model of the intrinsic circuitry of the basal ganglia, in particular the degree to which basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are functionally segregated at the level of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). To this end the responses of STN cells to somatosensory examination (n = 301 cells), the polarity and latencies of neuronal responses to passive and active movements (n = 223 cells), responses to microstimulation (n = 1589 sites), and cross-correlation functions of pairs of neighboring neurons (n = 72 pairs) were studied in STNs of three African green monkeys. 2. The activity of 55% of cells examined in STN was briskly modulated in response to passive movements of individual contralateral body parts. Of these, 86% responded to passive joint rotation of muscle palpation, but in some cases (25% of responding cells) responses were also elicited by light touch. In 91% of the responding cells responses were elicited by manipulations around a single joint only. 3. The caudoventral sector in STN was largely devoid of cells with responses to somatosensory stimulation. Within the rostrodorsal zone a lateral region containing neurons that responded to arm movements and a more medial region with neurons responding to leg movement were found. Cells responding to orofacial movements were located more dorsally and rostrally. Neurons with similar responses to active and passive movements of the limbs tended to be clustered within 'arm' and 'leg' zones. 4. Of identified arm cells in STN (n = 80), 36% responded to the application of torque pulses to the elbow (43 responses overall). Forty-eight percent of these cells responded to both extension and flexion torques. Ninety-three percent of the responses were initial increases in discharge, which characteristically occurred earlier and were shorter than initial decreases. Fifty-three percent of the responses were biphasic or multiphasic. 5. During active step tracking movements 40% of STN arm cells (n = 53 cells) responded with significant changes in activity. Thirty-six percent of these cells showed responses with both extension and flexion movements. Of the responses, 90% were increases in discharge. Only 14% of all responses were biphasic or multiphasic. Responses tended to occur around the time of movement onset (average latency 2 ms after movement onset). 6. Microstimulation (bipolar pulses, 40 μA, 200-500 ms train duration, 400 Hz) of the core of STN itself did not appear to produce movement. However, stimulation at the lateral borders of STN and of the adjacent white matter often led to limb or eye movement. 7. Cross-correlation analysis of simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons revealed significant synchronized activity in only 11% of pairs. 8. The somatotopic arrangement of neuronal responses and the paucity of neighboring cells discharging in synchrony strongly support the concept of functional segregation in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways. The predominance of brisk increases in discharge in STN in response to movements most likely results from corticosubthalamic activation. The current model of basal ganglia anatomy predicts that this will lead to inhibition of movements. The inhibitory role of STN in motor control is further supported by the failure of electrical stimulation of the nucleus to induce movements. The late onset of responses of STN neurons in the step tracking task suggests that STN and the 'indirect' pathway are not involved in the selection or initiation of movements, but may rather have a role in the control of ongoing movements.

TI  - The protective effec of continuous passive motion on living articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis: An experimental investigation in the rabbit
PY  - 1981
AB  - A review of the literature on the pathogenesis of the destruction of articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis in humans presents a paradox in treatment by complete rest and intermittent active motion in its management. The paradox is resolved by observations on an experimental acute staphylococcal septic arthritis of the knee joint in adolescent rabbits. Twenty-four hours after the intra-articular injection of Staphylococcus aureus, the infected joints were surgically drained and the rabbits were treated by penicillin. During the first two weeks the involved knee joints of 51 rabbits were managed by one of the following three methods: Series I-immobilization (cast); Series II-intermittent active motion (cage activity); Series III-continuous passive motion. At the end of two weeks all rabbits were permitted normal cage activity until the time of sacrifice. The methods of assessment of the articular cartilage of the involved joints included lateral radiographs, gross examination, microscopic examination (including histochemistry), and biochemical determinations of the percent composition of collagen, keratin sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. A scoring system was developed to assess the articular cartilage in relation to cellularity, loss of matrix, cloning of chondrocytes, adhesions (pannus), and orthochromasia (with safranin-O). The rabbits in Series III tolerated continuous passive motion of their infected joints well; they appeared to be comfortable, slept and ate well, and continued to gain weight. Assessment of 28 involved joints after ten weeks revealed that continuous passive motion for two weeks had a striking and statistically significant protective effect on preventing progressive degeneration to the effects of either immobilization or intermittent active motion. In the knee joints of the animals managed by continuous passive motion there were fewer radiographic abnormalities, erosions, and osteophytes; less loss of cellularity and matrix; less cloning of chondrocytes; fewer adhesions (pannus); better orthochromasia with safranin-O; and more normal content of collagen, keratin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, and total hexosamine than in the knee joints of those rabbits managed either by immobilization or by intermittent active motion. Possible explanations of the protective effect of continuous passive motion the articular cartilage in an experimental model of acute septic arthritis include: (1) the prevention of adhesions (pannus); (2) the improvement of nutrition of the cartilage through increased diffusion of synovial fluid; (3) the enhancement of clearance of lysosomal enzymes and purulent exudate from the infected joint; and (4) the stimulation of living chondrocytes to synthesize the various components of the matrix. In the experimental model of septic arthritis neither immobilization nor intermittent active motion protected the articular cartilage from progressive degeneration. The concept of continuous passive motion may be applicable to the clinical management of acute septic arthritis in the human in combination with early surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  - The psychology of relaxation, posture, breathing and movement
PY  - 1960
AB  - The guiding thought in each section is the idea that physical exercises are not an 'aid to psychotherapy' but are themselves a psychptherapeutic method. In the first place relaxation is discussed, while 'progressive relaxation' and Schultz's 'autogenous training' are examined in greater detail. Attention is drawn to the effect of posture exercises and 'posture training' on the personality, and particular reference is made to the methods of Alexander. The author gives a systematic summary of the practical experiences on which Alexander's methods are based. The breathing process is described in a simplified form and stress is laid on voice exercises to achieve free movement of the voice. The following methods of influencing and training breathing are discussed: correction, active and passive movement exercises and massage. The psychology of movement is a wide term which also embraces relaxation, tension, posture and breathing. Group experience, music and dancing play a special role in movement exercises.

TI  - The psychophysics of proprioceptor sensitivity
PY  - 1983
AB  - The ability to assess the turn angle of the forearm in the horizontal plane was investigated in two series of observations on 150 subjects. In the first series, the subject himself, without visual monitoring, moved his arm to a certain intermediate value specified by the researcher (active movement A); while in the second series the arm was moved by the researcher (passive movement P). It is shown that the Stevens function power distribution was normal in A movement but asymmetric in P movement. It is suggested that this heterogeneity is caused by an indeterminacy factor in the case of P movement.

TI  - The psychophysics of touch
PY  - 1982
AB  - They examine probelms of measuring tactile capabilities in the context of structural and functional characteristics of receptors, physiological recording techniques, and in classical psychophysical experiments on passive touch.  Theoretical issues and empirical work on active touch are then introduced, with the authors noting that the issue of what information is added by using active touch, and whether the addition appreciable improves performance, is far from settled.  What seemed perfectly clear from the phenomenology of Katz, and from some early demonstrations by Gibson and co-workers, is a slippery issue as crucial experiments are attempted.  The authors consider separating the exploring functions of the hand from its sensing functions.  But such strategies for tactual perception might deter production of useful stimulus information via the exploratory process.  If,as the authors suggest, we are in the midst of the liveliest controversy since the era of Hunter and Lashley, it is hoped that the heat generated by the questions may produce rapid advances in the field.  For active touch, although recognized as important, has received far less research attention than the sensory physiology and psychophysics of the skin senses.

TI  - The puppeteer display: Attracting and actively shaping the audience with an interactive public banner display
PY  - 2014
AB  - We present a wide interactive banner display installed at a city sidewalk and the findings from two long-term field studies investigating the opportunities of public displays to actively shape the audience. In order to improve parallel usage and dissolve crowds, our wide display subtly directs individual users by visual stimuli and manipulates the audience like a puppeteer, thus reversing the notion of adaptive content being implicitly manipulated by the users. We first investigated visual signifiers which attract initial users approaching sideways, and then others, which actively influence user positions and regulate audience constellations. We found that dynamic visual stimuli such as frames and ellipses are effective (1) to direct users in front of the display, (2) to distribute multiple users along the display, (3) static frames are more effective than moving or interactive ones, and (4) these visual stimuli also work indirectly by inducing social pressure among users.

TI  - The quality of instructional messages.
PY  - 1988
AB  - Several qualities of a good educational message are described, including: active involvement; appropriate language; appropriate beginning level; proper attention to prerequisites; appropriate examples; distributed learning and practice; and quality control. Lectures encourage passive listening. In contrast, for most learners, active involvement is necessary to absorb and retain concepts. Learners cannot be actively involved unless they understand the information being conveyed and what is expected of them. The language of instructional messages needs to be appropriate for both the learner and the medium. Regardless of the medium, it is essential that the level of instruction be correct. 2 possible errors that involve level of instruction are that instruction assumes knowledge the students do not have, or that instruction teaches things learners already know. At each stage of instruction, students need to master prerequisites before proceeding to the next topic. Appropriate examples is another principle that underlies effective instruction. Examples must be distributed in time and in a way that leads to effective learning and longterm retention. In general, the teaching and continued practice of a skill must be distributed over a considerable amount of time. The way to ensure quality of the finished product is to field test instructional messages with a typical audience and use the information collected to improve the program.

TI  - The quantification of joint laxity in dancers and gymnasts
PY  - 1999
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the range of movement in gymnastic and dance populations. Sixty-five participants (41 females, 24 males; mean age 21.4 years) were assessed. The sample included dancers and gymnasts ranging from novice and club standard to international and professional status. Non-specialized physical education students acted as controls. Range of movement was measured at the shoulders, hips, lumbar spine and ankles using a Loebl hydrogoniometer, and inherent joint laxity was assessed using Beighton and coworkers' adaptation of the Carter and Wilkinson 9-point scale. The right and left sides of the body were assessed and measures of active and passive motion were recorded. A graded increase in laxity was observed from controls, through novice gymnasts, to dancers and finally international gymnasts. The greater laxity of females than males was also confirmed. Dancers and gymnasts had a greater passive range of movement in all joints, which was partly inherited and partly acquired. There was a large difference between their active and passive ranges, which appeared to render the joints unstable.

TI  - The quantitative assessment of functional disorders of the hand and upper limb [Kil'kisna otsinka porushen' funktsiï kysti ta verkhn'oï kintsivky.]
PY  - 1999
AB  - Methods have been developed for calculation of quantitative indicators of the hand and upper limb function, which rely on measurement of sensitivity of fingers, the pick-objects-up test (a modified Moberg test), measurement of active and passive movements of joints, hand grips. The following quantitative indicators are computable from formulae: sensitivity, motor function of joints, grips/grasps, coordination of movements. Based on the above four indicators is computation of the integral function of the hand and upper extremity. Computation procedure for quantitative determinants of the upper limb function has been approved of in 156 patients with sequelae of injuries. For a comparative analysis an assessment was performed in these patients of the nerve function by the scoring scale M0-M5, S0-S5, and of the tendon function by the methodology of the American Association of surgeons of the hand and as recommended by Strickland J. W. (1989). The proposed methodology significantly reflects the principal determinants of the function, secures quantitative data on different aspects and integral determinants of the function of the hand and upper extremity.

TI  - The range of motion of the scapula and its functional implications
PY  - 1999
AB  - The scapula is often overlooked or ignored in shoulder complex studies as its motions occur under skin and muscles which, in vivo, makes measurements difficult to obtain. In fact, the scapula is often considered as a separate entity to the shoulder mechanism, as it has no fixed relationship to other features on the thorax, as found with, for example, the arm. The aim of this study is the description of complete 3D-scapular motion in its functional context. Distances were measured from three bony landmarks on the scapula to a fixed point on a vertebra. It is clear from data analysis of a 'normal' (i.e. without scoliosis) population that males were generally more flexible and achieved greater scapular range of motion than females. Differences also exist between arm (i.e. left/right, one-arm/two-arm) movements and between passive and active movements. This study has produced new data regarding motion of the scapula in various planes of movement, which has direct relevance to the study of shoulder asymmetry and resulting arm length differences found in scoliotic patients.

AB  - A study was made to determine the degree of correlation between the shooting accuracy of nine varsity basketball players and the visual attributes of static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, depth perception, and size constancy. The data were subjected to a principal-component analysis, followed by a linear regression model, using a digital computer. The results indicate that basket shooting accuracy is significantly dependent upon dynamic visual acuity, and that individual shooting performances from both the field and free-throw line can be predicted within an error of 4 using the multiple regression model developed in this study. © 1971 American Academy of Optometry.

TI  - The relationship between functionality and erector spinae activity in patients with specific low back pain during dynamic and static movements
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Alterations in the activity of the lumbar erector spinae (LES) muscles on both sides of the spine have been inconsistently reported in patients with specific low back pain (sLBP) after measuring the muscular activity with surface electromyography (sEMG). It also remains unclear whether these alterations in LES activity can be related to the functional level of patients with sLBP.Research question: This study investigated the LES activity in patients with sLBP during activities of daily living (ADL) which included dynamic and static movement tasks. Moreover, the alterations in LES activity were correlated with the first seven questions of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ-SS).Methods: Thirty patients with specific LBP and twenty healthy subjects were recruited to perform five ADLs including 'static waist flexion', 'sit to stand',' 30-seconds standing', '6-minutes walking' and 'climbing stairs'. sEMG sensors were mounted on the left and right LES muscles. The integrated EMG (IEMG) was calculated from the preprocessed sEMG data as statistical comparison criteria.Results: LES activity was significantly higher in patients during 'sit to stand',' 30-seconds standing' and 'climbing stairs' and significantly lower during 'static waist flexion' compared to healthy controls. All tasks showed a significant correlation with the ZCQ-SS score except for '6-minutes walking', whereby LES activity and ZCQ-SS score correspondingly increased during 'sit to stand' and 'climbing stairs' and the LES activity decreased with an increasing ZCQ-SS score during 'static waist flexion' and' 30-seconds standing'.

TI  - The relationship between musculoskeletal strength, physiological characteristics, and knee kinesthesia following fatiguing exercise
PY  - 2012
AB  - Fatiguing exercise may result in impaired functional joint stability and increased risk of unintentional injury. While there are several musculoskeletal and physiological characteristics related to fatigue onset, their relationship with proprioceptive changes following fatigue has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between musculoskeletal and physiological characteristics and changes in proprioception, measured by threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM), following fatiguing exercise. Twenty, physically active females participated (age: 28.65 ± 5.6 years, height: 165.6 ± 4.3 cm, weight: 61.8 ± 8.0 kg, BMI: 22.5± 2.3 kg/m 2, BF: 23.3 ± 5.4%). During Visit 1, subjects completed an exercise history and 24-hour dietary questionnaire, and body composition, TTDPM familiarization, isokinetic knee strength, and maximal oxygen uptake/lactate threshold assessments. During Visit 2, subjects completed TTDPM and isometric knee strength testing prior to and following a fatiguing exercise protocol. Wilcoxon signed rank tests determined TTDPM and isometric knee strength changes from pre- to post-fatigue. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients determined the relationship between strength and physiological variables with pre- to post-fatigue changes in TTDPM and with pre-fatigue and post-fatigue TTDPM in extension and flexion (α=0.05). No significant differences were demonstrated from pre-fatigue to post-fatigue TTDPM despite a significant decrease in isometric knee flexion strength (P<0.01) and flexion/extension ratio (P<0.05) following fatigue. No significant correlations were observed between strength or physiological variables and changes in TTDPM from pre- to post-fatigue in extension or flexion. Flexion/extension ratio was significantly correlated with pre-fatigue TTDPM in extension (r=-0.231, P<0.05). Peak oxygen uptake was significantly correlated with pre-fatigue (r=- 0.500, P<0.01) and post-fatigue (r=-0.520, P<0.05) TTDPM in extension. No significant relationships were demonstrated between musculoskeletal and physiological characteristics and changes in TTDPM following fatigue. The results suggest that highly trained individuals may have better proprioception, and that the high fitness level of subjects in this investigation may have contributed to absence of TTDPM deficits following fatigue despite reaching a high level of perceptual and physiological fatigue. Future studies should consider various subject populations, other musculoskeletal strength characteristics, and different modalities of proprioception to determine the most important contributions to proprioceptive changes following fatigue.

TI  - The relationship between proprioceptive function and dynamic balance in ACL injured knees
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: In previous studies, it has been reported that knee injury with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture cause deficits in knee proprioception. However, it is unclear whether knee proprioceptive deficit after ACL injury affect body performance. A few studies report the relationship between proprioceptive function and dynamic balance in ACL injured knees. Thus, there is a need for further studies regarding the relationship between knee proprioceptive and dynamic balance. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the association of knee proprioceptive function and dynamic balance in ACL injured patients. Methods: A total of 54 subjects (29 men and 25 women; mean age 29.2±11.7 yrs old, height 166.2±9.4 cm, weight 65.5±15.0 kg) were recruited for the study. Knee joint proprioception was assessed using a proprioception-testing apparatus (Sensor Ouyou, Hiroshima, Japan) to measure each subject's threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM). The patient was tested in a seated position, and the tested limb was put into a pneumatic boot. The evaluation was started from a position of 15° or 45° of knee flexion, and the movable shaft randomly shifted gradually by 0.2°/s toward either the flexion or extension directions. The patient's reaction time was recorded as the TTDPM. Dynamic balance was evaluated by a Biodex balance system SD (Biodex Medical Systems Incorporated, Shirley, New York). The subjects held a single leg standing position on the platform for 20 s. The output was calculated from the computer interface in the form of a stability index. All analyses were conducted using the PASW version 18.0 statistical analysis software (SPSS Japan, Japan). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the sideto- side difference in proprioceptive function and dynamic balance. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the association of proprioceptive function and dynamic balance. The statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05. Results: Knee proprioception on the injured side showed a significant decrease compared to the uninjured side. Dynamic balance showed no significant difference between the injured side and uninjured side. There was no significant correlation between knee proprioceptive function and dynamic balance. Conclusion(s): Patients with ACL injury were found to show no significant correlation between knee proprioceptive function and dynamic balance. Dynamic balance may be more strongly influenced by factors other than knee proprioception. Implications: This study indicates that knee proprioception does not play a major role in dynamic balance.

TI  - The relationship between sea ice concentration and the spatio-temporal distribution of vocalizing bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas from 2008 to 2011
PY  - 2015
AB  - Bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) are widely distributed in the Arctic and sub-Arctic; the Beringia population is found throughout the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (BCB). Bearded seals are highly vocal, using underwater calls to advertise their breeding condition and maintain aquatic territories. They are also closely associated with pack ice for reproductive activities, molting, and resting. Sea ice habitat for this species varies spatially and temporally throughout the year due to differences in underlying physical and oceanographic features across its range. To test the hypothesis that the vocal activity of bearded seals is related to variations in sea ice, passive acoustic data were collected from nine locations throughout the BCB from 2008 to 2011. Recording instruments sampled on varying duty cycles ranging from 20% to 100% of each hour, and recorded frequencies up to 8192 Hz. Spectrograms of acoustic data were analyzed manually to calculate the daily proportion of hours with bearded seal calls at each sampling location, and these call activity proportions were correlated with daily satellite-derived estimates of sea ice concentration. Bearded seals were vocally active nearly year-round in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas with peak activity occurring from mid-March to late June during the mating season. The duration of call activity in the Bering Sea was shorter, lasting typically only five months, and peaked from mid-March to May at the northernmost recorders. In all areas, call activity was significantly correlated with higher sea ice concentrations (p < 0.01). These results suggest that losses in ice over may negatively impact bearded seals, not just by loss of habitat but also by altering the behavioral ecology of the BCB population.

TI  - The relationship between shoulder osteology and glenohumeral axial rotation
PY  - 2016
AB  - The range of motion of the Glenohumeral joint (GHJ) varies between individuals and depends on the position of the humerus. Currently there is limited understanding of the causes of this variation. An improved understanding of the constraints of the GHJ and their influence on the range of motion of the GHJ can be used in the clinical assessment of the shoulder, shoulder rehabilitation and shoulder implant design. This thesis aims to investigate the relationship between the bone geometry of the GHJ and the axial rotational range of the joint. A protocol to measure the maximum internal-external rotation of the GHJ was developed to quantify the axial rotational range of the GHJ during active motion and during passive motion in response to a measured torque. The protocol was used to investigate the effect of plane and elevation angle on the axial rotational range of the GHJ in 30 asymptomatic subjects. The intra-subject, inter-subject, intra-session and inter-session reliabilities of the protocol were quantified. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional bone geometrical parameters acquired from MRI scans of the shoulder were used to describe normal variation in the shape of the GHJ. A linear regression expression was formulated at each humeral position using three geometrical parameters to predict the maximum active and passive internal and external rotations. Segmented MRI scans were used to create a bone model of the subject’s shoulder and collision detection investigated points of bony collision which were likely to limit the subject’s maximum internal and external rotation. Two-dimensional geometrical parameters of the humerus, articular cartilage, glenoid, acromion and coracoid provide an accurate estimate of the maximum internal and external rotation of the GHJ. These parameters and the observed bony constraints from collision detection improve understanding of how the shape of the humerus and scapula at the GHJ affect the range of motion that can be achieved. Different bony constraints at the GHJ lead to changes in the range of motion with humero-thoracic elevation angle and elevation plane; whilst variation in the geometrical parameters between subjects result in differences in the maximum internal and external rotation between individuals.

TI  - The relationship of extraneous movements to lumbar paraspinal muscle activity: Implications for EMG biofeedback training applications to low back pain patients
PY  - 1989
AB  - Within recent years clinicians and researchers have applied paraspinal EMG biofeedback procedures during static and dynamic movement retraining of chronic low back pain patients. Most of these applications make use of surface electromyography, an approach complicated by the fact that the erector spinae muscles are deeply situated. This descriptive study reveals that extraneous movements, such as neck flexion and pelvic rotation, can elicit profound activity from percutaneously placed EMG electrodes while little change is seen at the skin surface. The implications of these observations for the use of EMG feedback to remediate low back pain are discussed. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

TI  - The relationship of foot and ankle movement to venous return in the lower limb
PY  - 1999
AB  - We have studied the relationship between movements of the foot and ankle and venous blood flow from the lower limb using colourflow Duplex ultrasound to determine the optimum type of exercise for promoting venous return. Studies of both active and passive movements were carried out on 40 limbs in 20 subjects (18 men; 2 women), with a median age of 27 years (20 to 54). We assessed ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, subtalar inversion and eversion, and a combination of all movements. There was no difference in venous flow when comparing opposite limbs in a single subject (p &gt; 0.5), but active exercises produced higher peak and mean velocities of blood flow than passive ones. The active combined movement produced the highest velocities with an increase of 38% in mean and of 58% in peak flow velocities, which were significantly greater than the peak and mean flow rates produced by passive movements. The active combined exercise would therefore be the most effective in eliminating stasis and could contribute to the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis.

TI  - The relationship of tuning and noise correlations in macaque auditory cortex
PY  - 2015
AB  - Comments on an article by Joshua D. Downer et al. (see record 2015-23531-017). All neurons are noisy, but some neurons are more noisy than others, Downer and colleagues report in a recent issue of The Journal of Neuroscience. Downer and colleagues present evidence for correlation-based coding optimization in the primate brain. The authors set out to examine the changes in the signal and noise correlation structure that occur within the primary auditory cortex (A1) of macaques as the behavioral relevance of the auditory input is varied. Specifically, they asked: does the transition from passive listening to active engagement in an auditory task increase or decrease noise correlation between pairs of cells in A1? Are pairs with similar tuning affected in the same way as dissimilarly tuned pairs, and does the overall effect benefit or compromise stimulus discriminability in A1? One glossed-over but perhaps worrying fact is that attention and learning related changes in noise correlation magnitude tend to be small, raising the question of their relative significance for cortical stimulus processing. Noise may be important, but for reasons altogether different than optimal population coding. Work in artificial intelligence, for example, has demonstrated that a degree of stochastic silencing of units during learning can greatly aid neural network performance. Downer and colleagues have shown the importance of characterizing noise in the context of cellular tuning rather than treating it as a blanket population phenomenon. Future work should reveal whether stimulus-independent covariations in neural activity are indeed detrimental to coding or, alternatively, reveal stamps of a higher-order architectural plan, substructures of which are dynamically brought in and out of focus to accommodate the demands of the task at hand.

TI  - The relative timing of active and passive touch
PY  - 2008
AB  - Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The relevance of sensory input for the cerebellar control of movements
PY  - 1997
AB  - The performance of a motor task not only requires subjects to plan, prepare, and initiate but also to monitor how a movement is performed. We used positron emission tomography to examine to what extent the human cerebellum is involved in controlling motor output or sensory input from movements in normal subjects. In the first study, we compared the active performance of a motor task (flexion and extension of the right elbow) to the passive execution of the same movements. Passive movements were driven by a motor with the arm fixed in a guide hinge. Active movements (compared to rest) elicited increases of rCBF mainly in the ipsilateral neocerebellar hemisphere and vermis of the posterior lobe. During passive movements, almost identical parts of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were activated (compared to the rest condition). The direct comparison of active and passive movement conditions revealed a small activation of the neocerebellar hemisphere of the posterior lobe and cerebellar nuclei ipsilateral to the movement. Approximately 90% of cerebellar neuronal activity was related to sensory input. In the second study, we compared the execution of a free selection joystick movement task to a condition in which subjects simply imagined the movements. The execution of movements (compared to rest) was associated with increases of rCBF in the ipsilateral neocerebellar hemisphere and vermis of the posterior lobe. During movement imagination, a small part of the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere and vermis of the posterior lobe was activated (compared to rest). The increase of rCBF during movement imagination accounted for only 20% of the signal seen during movement execution. Our results indicate that the neocerebellum may be much more concerned with sensory information processing than has been considered previously. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

TI  - The relevance of vegetation structures and small water bodies for bats foraging above farmland
PY  - 2018
AB  - Bats are known to forage and commute close to vegetation structures when moving across the agricultural matrix, but the role of isolated landscape elements in arable fields for bat activity is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the influence of small isolated ponds which lie within arable fields close to vegetation structures on the flight and foraging activity of bats. Additionally, we compared species-specific activity measures between forest edges and linear structures such as hedgerows. We repeatedly recorded bat activity using passive acoustic monitoring along 20 transects extending from the vegetation edge up to 200 m into the arable field (hereafter: edge-field interface) with a small pond present at five transects per edge type (linear vs. forest). Using generalized linear mixed effect models, we analyzed the effects of edge type, pond presence and the season on species-specific flight and foraging activity within the edge-field interface. We found a higher flight activity of Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus pygmaeus above the arable field when a pond was present. Furthermore, Pipistrellus nathusii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus foraged more frequently at forest edges than at linear structures (e.g. hedgerows). Additionally, we found three major patterns of seasonal variation in the activity of bats along the edge-field interface. This study highlights the species-specific and dynamic use of forest and hedgerow or tree line edges by bats and their importance for different bat species in the agricultural landscape. Further, additional landscape elements such as small isolated ponds within arable fields might support the activity of bats above the open agricultural landscape, thereby facilitating agroecosystem functioning. Therefore, additional landscape elements within managed areas should be restored and protected against the conversion into arable land and better linked to surrounding landscape elements in order to efficiently support bats within the agroecosystem.

TI  - The reliability and response stability of dynamic testing of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in patients with vestibular disease
PY  - 2011
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the test-retest reliability and response stability of the Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and Gaze Stabilization Test (GST) in patients with vestibular disorders. Twenty-nine patients with vestibular disease (16-78 years) participated. Subjects performed the GST and DVA in pitch and yaw planes, twice in one session and once after 7-10 days. The GST output is the maximum head velocity at which the patient was able to identify orientation of the letter E. The DVA output is the change in visual acuity when moving the head compared to static acuity. Subjects indicated their level of dizziness and visual blurring using a visual analog scale. Within-and between-sessions intraclass correlation coefficients ranged between 0-0.5 for the DVA and GST measures, with better correlations for within-session assessments. Response stability (standard error of measurement / mean) of the GST ranged between 21-32% and the DVA ranged between 25-69% with vertical DVA being most influenced by measurement error. Subjects' symptoms did not correlate with performance on either test. The current test protocol needs refinement to enhance reliability and stability in persons with vestibular disorders.

TI  - The repair of major osteochondral defects in joint surfaces by neochondrogenesis with autogenous osteoperiosteal grafts stimulated by continuous passive motion. An experimental investigation in the rabbit
PY  - 1986
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of continuous passive motion (CPM) on the chondrogenic potential of autogenous osteoperiosteal grafts to repair major osteochondral defects. A 3.5-mm-wide circular full-thickness defect was drilled in one medial femoral condyle of 55 adolescent New Zealand rabbits. A graft of periosteum from the proximal tibia was wrapped around a disc of bone from the same area (cambium layer of the periosteum facing outward), then press-fitted into the defect. The rabbits were treated by either immobilization (Imm) or intermittent active motion (IAM) for five weeks, or by continuous passive motion (CPM) for two weeks followed by IAM for three weeks. A control group (no osteoperiosteal graft in the defect) was also treated by CPM for two weeks and IAM for three weeks. At five weeks, hyaline cartilage was the predominant tissue in only 10% of the defects in the Imm, IAM, and control groups, compared with 70% in the CPM group (p < .025). Bonding of the newly formed tissue to the adjacent cartilage was significantly better in the CPM group.

TI  - The representation of arm movements in postcentral and parietal cortex
PY  - 1988
AB  - Considerable experimental exidence supports the hypothesis that the neocortical processes underlying kinesthetic sensation form a hierarchical series of cells signalling increasingly complex patterns of movement of the body. However, this view has been criticized and the data lack quantitative verification under controlled conditions. These studies have also typically used one-dimensional (reciprocal) movements, even of multiple degree-of-freedom joints such as the wrist or shoulder, and have been restricted to passive movements. This latter limitation is particularly critical, since the response of many muscle receptors is affected by fusimotor activity while that of many articular receptors is sensitive to the level of muscle contractile activity. Both factors introduce significant kinesthetic ambiguity to the signals arising from these receptors during active movement. This ambiguity is evident in the discharge of primary somatosensory cortex proprioceptive cells. Studies in area 5 show that single cells signal shoulder joint movements in the form of broad directional tuning curves. The pattern of activity of the entire population encodes movement direction. The cells appear to encode spatial aspects of movement unambiguously, since their discharge is relatively insensitive to the changes in muscle activity required to produce the same movements under different load conditions. It is not yet certain whether the somesthetic activity in area 5 is a kinesthetic representation that is sequential to and hierarchically superior to that in SI, or whether it is a parallel representation with separate and distinct functions.

TI  - The representation of pictorial information for computer assisted teaching systems.
PY  - 1994
AB  - There is an increasing interest in the use of pictorial information in educational programs particularly following developments in multi-media technology.  Pictures and visual material are important  not only in providing contextual and illustrative support, but because visual information is easily accessed in memory and gives a visual `anchoring' that aids recall.  However the medium has not been fully exploited in Computer-Based-Learning systems, one reason being that there are not sufficiently powerful picture representation languages which can encode spatial 3D information to allow the depiction of scenes from a user-centred viewpoint.  Previous work identifies scene-objects and scene descriptions by labels or pre-stored titles, and current 3D systems offering sophisticated graphics and Virtual Reality (VR) facilities base their representation on coordinate geometry, and lack a high level propositional description of static and dynamic scenes.  This research addresses the problem of defining a `Scene-Description-Language' (SDL) suitable for description of visual frame or frame-sequences, and which can be used by the program to facilitate authoring, to point out and comment on features, and automatically provide descriptions when the observer changes the viewpoint.  The ways the SDL links to coordinate descriptions and to high level semantic representations are also illustrated.  Further, by defining notions of connections between scene components and the stability of the resulting structures, the system can be used to work out plans for elementary assembly and construction tasks.  The working context is the description of static visual scenes (e.g. of a room) including the spatial information (e.g. location and orientation) of objects and their relation to other objects.  The SDL design is based on the ways 3D scenes are perceived by human subjects and a three-level SDL is proposed providing facilities for the user to edit and manipulate scenes within a 3D spatial framework.

TI  - The respiratory response to passive and active arm movements is enhanced in delayed onset muscle soreness
PY  - 2009
AB  - We previously reported that ventilatory response at the onset of light leg exercise was augmented in delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after eccentric exercise (ECC) utilizing the leg. In this study, we examined whether the same result would appear in light exercise in which an arm with DOMS was utilized. Eleven subjects performed ECC using one arm, and we measured ventilatory responses to a 20-s single-arm extension-flexion exercise and to passive movement (PAS) before and 2 days after ECC (D2). We found that ventilatory response to both the exercise and PAS in which all subjects perceived DOMS was augmented at D2. It was concluded that initial hyperpnea, which occurred during arm exercise in DOMS, was enhanced, and from examining the result of PAS, enhanced initial exercise hyperpnea may be due in part to an exaggerated peripheral neural reflex.

TI  - The response of acute anterior poliomyelitis to the adrenergic blocking agents and hot pack therapy
PY  - 1953
AB  - Relief of severe subjective pain at rest is practically always accomplished within one-half to eight hours with 'priscoline' or 'dibenamine' whereas packs are much less effective and take considerably longer. Relaxation of muscle spasm with drug therapy was either quite definite or completely absent, suggesting that more than vaso-spasm may be involved aetiologically. At least 50% of the cases responded favourably enough to eliminate the need for hot packs. Although actual limitation of mobility might still remain after drugs in some cases, stretch pain in muscle was frequently eliminated, permitting early physical therapy. Initial improvement with drugs in some cases was superseded by more severe spasm in five to six days. In those cases tested with 'dibenamine' this was found to result from the use of the oral route which is ineffective. Early active and passive motion within the limits of pain must be instituted with drug therapy if favourable results are to be obtained. Genito-urinary and gastro-intestinal dysfunctions were unaltered by any form of therapy. No severe toxicity was observed with either drug: however, the use of 'dibenamine' is not without danger. It must be used with caution, with careful observation of the patient during administration. In general, drug therapy is worthy of trial in most cases of poliomyelitis as the presence or lack of response will be quickly evident Thus early use of hot packs, if necessary, will not be delayed. In this study, the muscles in poliomyelitis with the greatest temperature were those in spasm, followed by weak and then by normal muscles. Response to therapy in terms of temperature of muscle was greatest in the case of weak muscles. No abnormally low skin temperatures were observed and the response to 'dibenamine' was more marked than to 'priscoline'. In terms of muscle temperature the effective therapeutic response was greatest in the case of 'dibenamine' followed by 'priscoline' and by hot packs. No obvious absolute ischaemia in muscle was noted, but it is suggested that increased tissue metabolism may create a relative anoxia which may be relieved by an increase in blood flow. Hypersensitivity of denervated muscles to acetylcholine may be enhanced by adrenolytic agents and therefore explain the marked temperature increase following therapy. Further studies on tissue metabolism and blood flow are indicated before an adequate explanation will be available for muscle spasm and pain.

TI  - The results of arthroscopic capsular release in the treatment of frozen shoulder - Two-year follow-up [Wyniki artroskopowej kapsuloligamentotomii w leczeniu barku zamrożonego po dwóch latach obserwacji]
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background. The term frozen shoulder refers to an inflammatory condition characterized by pain and reduced range of passive and active motion of the shoulder. Initial management is mostly conservative. In some cases, however, invasive treatment is necessary. Given the dearth of available data on long-term operative outcomes, it appears interesting to present a comprehensive discussion of this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of range of motion and function of the affected shoulder after a minimum of two-year follow-up following arthroscopic capsular release of idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder. Material and methods. The study enrolled 30 patients with frozen shoulder, including 16 patients with idiopathic FS and 14 patients with posttraumatic frozen shoulder. All patients had an anteroinferior capsular release and three additionally had a posterior capsulotomy. After a minimum of two-years of follow-up, the shoulder's range of motion and limb function were evaluated according to a modified version of the Constant-Murley Score (0-75), the ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) score and a subjective scale designed by the authors. Results. The improvement in the range of motion after arthroscopic capsular release was considerable and statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to pre-operative values both intraoperatively and after a minimum of two years of followup in both groups and across all planes of movement tested. The improvement of function of the shoulder after a minimum two years following arthroscopic capsular release was significant (p<0.05) according to the Constant-Murley score (from 19.3 preoperatively to 65.9 postoperatively, 0-75) and the ASES score (from 22.8 preoperatively to 92.7 postoperatively, 0-100). Conclusion. Arthroscopic capsular release significantly improved the range of motion and function in idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder. © MEDSPORTPRESS.

TI  - The results of arthroscopic capsular release in the treatment of frozen shoulder - two-year follow-up.
PY  - 2010
AB  - BACKGROUND: The term frozen shoulder refers to an inflammatory condition characterized by pain and reduced range of passive and active motion of the shoulder. Initial management is mostly conservative. In some cases, however, invasive treatment is necessary. Given the dearth of available data on long-term operative outcomes, it appears interesting to present a comprehensive discussion of this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of range of motion and function of the affected shoulder after a minimum of two-year follow-up following arthroscopic capsular release of idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 patients with frozen shoulder, including 16 patients with idiopathic FS and 14 patients with posttraumatic frozen shoulder. All patients had an anteroinferior capsular release and three additionally had a posterior capsulotomy. After a minimum of two-years of follow-up, the shoulder's range of motion and limb function were evaluated according to a modified version of the Constant-Murley Score (0-75), the ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) score and a subjective scale designed by the authors.RESULTS: The improvement in the range of motion after arthroscopic capsular release was considerable and statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to pre-operative values both intraoperatively and after a minimum of two years of follow-up in both groups and across all planes of movement tested. The improvement of function of the shoulder after a minimum two years following arthroscopic capsular release was significant (p<0.05) according to the Constant-Murley score (from 19.3 preoperatively to 65.9 postoperatively, 0-75) and the ASES score (from 22.8 preoperatively to 92.7 postoperatively, 0-100).CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic capsular release significantly improved the range of motion and function in idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder.

TI  - The results of primary repair and early passive rehabilitation in zone II flexor tendon injuries in children [Cocuklarda ikinci bölge fleksör tendon yaralanmalarinda primer onarim ve erken pasif rehabilitasyon sonuçlari.]
PY  - 2003
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of zone II flexor tendon injuries treated by primary repair and early rehabilitation in children under the age of 14 years. METHODS: The study included 25 digits of 23 patients (12 boys, 11 girls; mean age 7 years; range 2 to 14 years) with appropriate follow-up. Sixteen patients underwent surgery within the first 24 hours, while the remaining patients had surgery in a mean of three days (range 2 to 14 days). Digital nerve injuries were detected in 10 digits (40%). Repair of the tendons was performed with the use of a modified Kessler technique followed by an above-elbow stabilization splint. Passive flexion-extension exercises were started on the postoperative first day according to the Duran technique. The results were evaluated according to the Glocovac and Strickland's criteria. The mean follow up period was 49 months (range 12 to 92 months). RESULTS: Functional results were excellent in 18 digits (72%), good in five digits (20%), fair in one digit (4%), and poor in one digit (4%). The mean total active movement was 78.5% (range 0% to 100%). No significant differences were observed in functional results with regard to age groups and the presence or absence of digital nerve injuries (p>0.05). No occurrences of infection were encountered. CONCLUSION: The results show that primary repair and early passive mobilization of zone II flexor tendon injuries in children yield satisfactory results.

TI  - The role of action in sensation : evidence from colour perception
PY  - 2004
AB  - For proponents of the sensorimotor approach to perception consciousness is not &amp;amp;lsquo;generated&amp;amp;lsquo; by passive reception of information on sensors or by neural excitation. Instead, phenomenal experience occurs when an agent interacts with its environment, involving its body in mastered active exploration. Action-sensation coupling is therefore a necessary condition for perception, even in cases such as colour vision, where the coupling is often implicit and eye movements are not necessary at any given moment to perceive. Thus, colour sensation could be defined by the specific coupling between eye movements and transformations in cone excitation. Using left-field blue / right-field yellow spectacles. we introduced an artificial regularity between eye movements and colour changes. Perceptual learning of the new sensory motor contingency was obtained in 40 minutes, inducing a dependency of colour judgement on the direction of eye movement. A second compute\nr-contro\nlled exp\neriment\nconfirmed these results for luminance judgement after 20 minutes of exposure. Our experiments established clearly the necessity of eye movement for perceptual learning and argue for the constitutive role of action in the genesis of colour sensation.

TI  - The role of active exploration of 3D face stimuli on recognition memory of facial information
PY  - 2007
AB  - Research on face recognition has mainly relied on methods in which observers are relatively passive viewers of face stimuli. This study investigated whether active exploration of three-dimensional (3D) face stimuli could facilitate recognition memory. A standard recognition task and a sequential matching task were employed in a yoked design. Observers in the active condition explored 3D views of faces via a mouse or joystick during the training and test sessions of the task, whereas observers in the passive condition simply viewed the replay of the same sequence of face stimuli generated by the active observers. It was found that the active condition produced better recognition accuracy than the passive condition. The study provides the first evidence that active exploration of 3D face stimuli can lead to better face recognition memory and matching performance.

TI  - The role of differential delays in integrating transient visual and proprioceptive information
PY  - 2014
AB  - Many actions involve limb movements toward a target. Visual and proprioceptive estimates are available online, and by optimally combining (Ernst and Banks, 2002) both modalities during the movement, the system can increase the precision of the hand estimate. The notion that both sensory modalities are integrated is also motivated by the intuition that we do not consciously perceive any discrepancy between the felt and seen hand's positions. This coherence as a result of integration does not necessarily imply realignment between the two modalities (Smeets et al., 2006). For example, the two estimates (visual and proprioceptive) might be different without either of them (e.g., proprioception) ever being adjusted after recovering the other (e.g., vision). The implication that the felt and seen positions might be different has a temporal analog. Because the actual feedback from the hand at a given instantaneous position reaches brain areas at different times for proprioception and vision (shorter for proprioception), the corresponding instantaneous unisensory position estimates will be different, with the proprioceptive one being ahead of the visual one. Based on the assumption that the system integrates optimally and online the available evidence from both senses, we introduce a temporal mechanism that explains the reported overestimation of hand positions when vision is occluded for active and passive movements (Gritsenko et al., 2007) without the need to resort to initial feedforward estimates (Wolpert et al., 1995). We set up hypotheses to test the validity of the model, and we contrast simulation-based predictions with empirical data.

TI  - The role of environmental feedback in a brain state switch from passive to active sensing
PY  - 2013
AB  - Coherent behaviour emerges from mutual interaction between the brain, body and environment across multiple timescales and not from within the brain alone [1,2]. For example sensation is actively shaped by dynamical interaction of the brain and environment through motor actions such as sniffing, saccading, and touching. The onset of active sensing is often concomitant with qualitative changes in neural dynamics [3] and responses to sensory input [4,5]. Indeed, some neural responses are uniquely sensitive to the presence or absence of dynami-cal sensory feedback [6]. However, understanding how active sensing strategies impact on neural dynamics and sensory responses is an open challenge. Whisking behaviour in rodents has been the central model system for studying neural mechanisms of active sensing. During quiet wakefulness the membrane potential of neurons in the barrel cortex exhibit high power, low frequency fluctuations and nearby neurons become highly correlated [3]. As active whisking onsets, the brain state of the barrel cortex qualitatively changes: low frequency fluctuations are suppressed and nearby neurons decorrelate [3]. Interestingly both correlation and low frequency LFP are partially restored during periods of active touch, i.e., when the mouse palpate towards, and repeatedly contacts with an object [3]. The brain state transition is also concomitant with changes in responses of barrel cortex neurons to whisker stimulation. The sensitivity of neurons to whisker perturbation drops with the onset of whisking [5]. However, robust and repeatable whisker response are recovered for more naturalistic stimuli, i.e., active touch [5]. Here we propose a theory, and construct a model, of active whisking that explains the core phenomenology through the dynamical interaction between the brain and the environment. The three core assumptions underlying the theory are: 1. Strong low frequency membrane fluctuations, intra-neural correlations between nearby neurons, and sensory responses to brief whisker deflection associative with quiet attentive state arise as result of network dynamics that are close to a dynamical instability. 2. Reafferent input (sensory feedback related to self-action) during whisking behaviour provides negative feedback to sensory neurons that stabilize cortical dynamics reducing low frequency fluctuations, intra neural correlations, sensory responses to brief whisker deflection, while increasing the correlation between cortical activity and whisker position. 3. Interrupting the reafferent signal, via a whisker touch event, temporally destabilise the cortex and enhances ex-afferent input (external sensory input coding whisker contacts). Our theory and model suggests that sensory feedback via reafference signals is sufficient to account for the changes in cortical dynamics that appear with the onset of active whisking and provides a novel mechanistic account for sensory processing during active whisking. We discuss how this feedback stabilization mechanism coexists and interacts with other internal mechanisms that modulate cortical dynamics within the brain [3,7]. We quantify how this mechanism of active touch enhances the signal-to noise ratio of the input to the cortex. Finally we discuss the wider implications of these results for experimental work attempting to char-acterise neural activity and responses in an open-loop (in the absence of sensory/motor feedback) condition.

TI  - The role of intrathecal baclofen in the prevention of secondary complications after spinal cord injury
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective: Spinal cord injury has a devastating effect on the patients' life, not only by causing severe movement deficit but also by initiating a series of secondary complications. We investigate the hypothesis that intrathecal baclofen improves the spasticity in these patients and can effectively reduce the complications. Method: We reviewed the records of 11 patients treated with ITB for spasticity after spinal cord injury, in our department. There were nine males and two females with a mean age of 34 years at the time of pump implantation. A literature review was also performed. Results: Higher baclofen doses (100 μ,g) were necessary for a positive trial test in four patients (36%). The duration of interval from the time of spinal cord injury to the baclofen trial was on average 1.9 years and to the pump implantation 2.2 years. Following implantation of the pump, all the patients had significant improvement of the spasticity (affected limbs mean Modified Ashworth Scale score was 3.4 before and 0.9 after the pump implantation). There were two complications (0.18%), one wound infection which was treated conservatively and one wound dehiscence which needed a reoperation. During a mean follow-up period of 6 years, none of the patients had heterotopic ossification or decubitus ulcers which are usual secondary complications after spinal cord injury. Conclusion: Intrathecal baclofen for the treatment of spasticity after spinal cord injury can offer an improvement in the active movements of the limbs which is unpredictable and depends on the residual motor function. However, ITB treatment reduces spasticity, increases the passive range of motion, facilitates physiotherapy and as result of the above, ITB contributes significantly to an elimination of secondary complications after spinal cord injury.

TI  - The role of memory in static and dynamic visual search
PY  - 2003
AB  - The role of memory in visual search has lately become a controversial issue. Horowitz and Wolfe (H&W, 1998) asked participants to search displays for a letter "T" among letters "L" in two experimental conditions: In the static condition, the displays remained unchanged, whereas in the dynamic condition, all letters were randomly re-located every 111 ms. If search involves a memory-based mechanism that keeps track of the previously examined locations, observers would be expected to have great difficulties searching the dynamic display. Surprisingly, the target-present search rates in the dynamic did not differ from those in the static condition. Because a memory-based mechanism would be of no use in the dynamic condition, H&W concluded that memory is likewise not involved in the static condition. One alternative explanation for the results of H&W is that participants adopted a sit-and-wait strategy, which consists of attending to a region of the display and waiting for the target to appear there. Although H&W tried to rule out such an alternative explanation, this study argues that their participants have opted for a more sophisticated sit-and-wait strategy, one that allows the attentional focus to encompass several stimulus locations, and where the attentional focus can be shifted to other areas after some time has elapsed. This hypothesis is supported by experimental data showing that performance in H&W's dynamic condition does not differ from another dynamic condition (aperture condition), in which observers are forced to adopt a sit-and-wait strategy by being presented with a limited region of the display only. These results seriously question H&W's assumption that the dynamic condition provides an "analytical" counterpart to the static condition, which would allow us to infer how search is performed with normal, static displays. This paves the way for other theories emphasizing the role of memory in visual search.

TI  - The role of motion in children's categorization
PY  - 1998
AB  - Perceptual cues clearly play a fundamental role in early categorization. Perceptual properties, however, are typically understood to be static shape cues. Some studies have suggested that dynamic perceptual cues, such as motion, may also be important in categorization. This study was an attempt to explore the role that motion plays in children's categorization of biological kinds as well as in more abstract concepts, such as geometric figures. Confronted with a choice between movement and shape, 4-year-old children were found to base their inductions about category membership primarily on motion cues, regardless of whether the objects were animals or geometric figures. This pattern of responses is also present in 7-year-olds for animals but not for geometric figures. Older children may begin to appreciate that motion is unique to animals and are therefore less likely to use motion cues to categorize geometric figures. The results support the view that children are initially guided by motion in categorization. Only as they grow older do they begin to constrain their inferences with respect to different motion cues. The present findings suggest that motion plays an overriding role that is central in the process of concept acquisition and in the mechanisms by which concepts are later structured.

TI  - The role of motion in children's categorization of objects
PY  - 1999
AB  - Perceptual cues play a fundamental role in early categorization of objects. What is meant by perceptual cites in the literature, however, is not always clear. It is fair to say that they are typically understood to be static shape cues. A number of recent studies have suggested that dynamic perceptual cues, such as motion, may also be important in early categorization. The study presented here explored the role that motion plays in children's categorization of animal and non-animal kinds, such as geometric figures. Motion was directly pitted against shape as a cue for categorization. Results showed that 4-year-old children, confronted with a choice between shape and motion, significantly used motion cues over shape cues to categorize objects, regardless of whether they were animals or geometric figures. seven-year-olds also tended to use motion more often to categorize animals but not when dealing with geometric figures, Older children, who have been found to have a clearer natural kind/artifact distinction, seem to appreciate the uniqueness of movement to animals and see motion as more relevant to their categorization but relatively less so to categorize geometric figures. This developmental shift in the categorization of animals and geometric figures based on motion was further confirmed by testing adults on the same tasks. Adults were found to base their judgements significantly more often on motion for animals but not for geometric figures. These findings support the view that children are initially guided by motion in object categorization, suggesting that motion plays an overriding role that is central in the process of concept acquisition and in the mechanisms by which concepts are later structured.

TI  - The role of muscle receptors in the detection of movements
PY  - 2000
AB  - This review discusses the role of muscle receptors, in particular. that of muscle spindles, in the detection of movements, both passive and active, Emphasis is placed on the importance of conditioning the muscles acting at a joint before making measurements of thresholds to passive movements, to take into account muscle's thixotropic property. The detection threshold:movement velocity relation is discussed and described for a number of different joints. Implications for muscle spindles are considered from the generalisation that, when expressed in terms of proportion of muscle fascicle length change, detection thresholds are about the same at different joints. It is concluded that the available data supports the view that muscle spindles lie in parallel with only a portion of a muscle fascicle and not the whole fascicle. At the elbow joint, where it has been tested, movement detection threshold is lower juring passive movements than during contraction of elbow muscles. Both peripheral mechanisms and mechanisms operating within the central nervous system may be responsible for the rise in threshold. The signalling of movements by spindles during a contraction raises the question of how the central nervous system is able to extract the length signal under such circumstances, given that there is likely to be co-activation of alpha and gamma motoneurones. The evidence for a central subtraction of fusimotor-evoked impulses and some recent experiments relevant to this idea are described. In conclusion, a number of points of uncertainly have been revealed in this area and these should be the subject of future experiments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of parietal cortex in awareness of self-generated movements: A transcranial magnetic stimulation study
PY  - 2003
AB  - Awareness of self-generated movements arises from comparing motor plans, and the accompanying (hypothetical) efference copy, with the visual and proprioceptive consequences of movement. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate the role of a posterior region in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in this process. Nine healthy volunteers performed a finger extension actively and passively while wearing a CyberGlove; the glove recorded these (actual) finger movements and used this information in real time to move a virtual hand displayed on a computer screen. To assess the participant's awareness of movement onset, we introduced a delay between the onset of the actual and virtual movement (60-270 ms, 30 ms increments); the task was to judge whether the virtual hand movements were delayed relative to the actual hand movements. Low-frequency rTMS (15 min, 0.6 Hz) was applied either over the left SPL or the left temporal cortex (control site) to decrease excitability of these regions and, in turn, test their role in the awareness of self-generated movement. Following the SPL stimulation, participants' assessments of asynchrony were impaired for active but not passive movements. No significant changes were observed after rTMS applied over the control site. We suggest that these findings are consistent with the role of the SPL in evaluating the temporal congruency of peripheral (visual) and central (efference copy) signals associated with self-generated movements. As such, this region may contribute to the sense of 'agency' and its disturbances in disorders such as apraxia and schizophrenia.

AB  - Investigated 56 4–6 yr old children's reactions to depicted reality, which is assumed to be a certain indicator of cognitive development. Qualitative analysis revealed that the child is able to recognize and express some cognitive categories, their function, cause, consequence, purposefulness, finality, superimposed concepts. From developmental aspects, the child proceeds from static perception of the pictured object to dynamic conception expressed by functional and purposive relations from the perception of individual external signs to the gradual comprehension of internal connections, and from subjective relations toward gradual objectivization of thinking.

TI  - The role of self-produced movement and visual tracking in infant spatial orientation
PY  - 1984
AB  - In two longitudinal studies, infants were trained at 12 and 18 months to find an object hidden in one of two identical wells in a Plexiglas box. On the test trial, normal access was blocked and infants were either guided by their mother or allowed to move on their own to another opening on the opposite side. In Experiment 1 significantly more correct responding occurred after active movement than after passive at 12 months, with correct responding related to high visual tracking. In contrast, at 18 months correct search without tracking predominated among both movement conditions. A difference between the conditions in the position of the mother on the test trial was ruled out as a contributor to performance on the basis of data from Experiment 2. When opaque sides were inserted to prevent tracking in Experiment 3, active movement no longer facilitated correct search at 12 months, thus indicating that the tracking and not the active movement per se was the critical factor. © 1984.

TI  - The role of static measurements of the lower extremity in predicting dynamic rearfoot motion and subsequent injury
PY  - 2002
AB  - Dynamic motion of the rearfoot is difficult to assess clinically. Because characteristics of rearfoot motion are linked with injury, it would be beneficial if dynamic rearfoot motion could be predicted from static clinical measurements of the lower extremity. However, the relationship between static clinical measures and dynamic rearfoot motion remains elusive. Results of previous studies are outlined in this article. Rearfoot motion is inherently three dimensional. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to measure rearfoot motion in three dimensions. Further research is needed to better describe the relationship between static measurements of the lower extremity and dynamic rearfoot motion with the goal of predicting and preventing injury.

TI  - The role of the dorsal funiculus of the primate in tactile discrimination
PY  - 1975
AB  - The critical role of the dorsal funiculus for tactile discriminations requiring active exploration of the stimulus object was tested in the monkey. Pairs of discriminanda (patterned disks) were constructed with geometric designs of such size and shape as to require active palpation for successful discrimination. For comparison, other discriminanda with tactile qualities which could be recognized by a more passive response topography were also examined. Section of the dorsal funiculus resulted in severe, long-lasting deficits in discrimination of the patterned disks, while discrimination of the tactile qualities not requiring active exploration was retained. No significant motor impairment was observed. Lesions in the spinothalamic or spinocervical systems had no effect on either type of cutaneous discrimination. The results support the view that the afferents from the monkey hand which travel in the dorsal funiculus are critically and possibly exclusively involved in the perception of tactile stimuli requiring a spatiotemporal transformation by the introduction of movement. It is further suggested that such movement need not be self-initiated. © 1975.

TI  - The role of the subscapularis in preventing anterior glenohumeral subluxation in the abducted, externally rotated position of the arm
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background. Current literature suggests that the subscapularis muscle is the main active stabilizer when the humerus is abducted and externally rotated. Conservative treatment of anterior shoulder instability therefore aims at strengthening this muscle. Empirical models, however, have questioned the role of the subscapularis muscle as it has been observed to potentially support dislocation of the subluxated humeral head.Methods. Ten human shoulders were loaded with an anterior dislocating force and the effect of different subscapularis tensions on humeral translation was measured with the Motion Analysis system, for the abducted and externally rotated arm and neutral positions. Also, lines of action of the subscapularis segments were measured on a 3D epoxy model.Findings. Shoulders in which the humeral head migrated antero-superiorly under an external antero-inferior load were observed to dislocate under simulated active subscapularis tension in both positions. In contrast, shoulders in which the head migrated antero-inferiorly remained stable. Twice as many specimens dislocated in the abducted - externally rotated position than in the neutral position. The change in line of action of the subscapularis may account for this change.Interpretation. Exercises alone are unlikely to be adequate for all patients with anterior instability symptoms. Passive motion pattern of the humeral head might serve as an indicator as to whether the effect of strengthening the subscapularis might stabilize a shoulder without further operation. Development of a clinical test based on these findings might differentiate the non-operative from operative candidates among patients presenting with anterior instability of the shoulder.

TI  - The role of the team physician and athletic trainer, including non-operative management
PY  - 2014
AB  - In order for a patient to receive a timely diagnosis of sports hernia or athletic pubalgia, athletic trainers and physicians must be mindful of the signs and symptoms of this frustrating entity. Once the physician confirms the diagnosis, athletic trainers provide the first line of treatment by attempting non-operative management of the condition. The design of the rehabilitation program should be preceded by a thorough evaluation, which includes a detailed history, postural and flexibility assessment, and dynamic movement screen. For the best possible outcome, the conservative treatment plan should combine both passive and active therapies. Passive therapies include rest, physical therapy modalities, and manual therapy. Physicians may also prescribe oral anti-inflammatories or varying types of local injections to assist in decreasing pain and inflammation. Active therapies should focus on restoring range of motion, improving motor control, increasing core stability, and correcting muscular imbalances or deficits. A rehabilitation progression is provided based on the current evidence in the literature as well as the authors' clinical experience. While a number of factors play into the decision, surgical management of sports hernia should not be considered until a patient fails to improve despite attempting a multi-faceted rehabilitation program.

TI  - The role of vision in Parkinson's disease locomotion control: Free walking task
PY  - 2012
AB  - The current study addressed the role of visual information in the control of locomotion in people with Parkinson's disease. Twelve healthy individuals and 12 mild to moderate Parkinson's disease patients were examined while walking at self-selected velocities, under three visual sampling conditions: dynamic (normal lighting), static (static visual samples) and voluntary visual sampling. Subjects wore liquid crystal glasses for visual manipulation. Outcome measures included spatial-temporal parameters, braking and propulsive impulses, number of samples and total duration of voluntary visual samples. Interaction between groups and visual conditions was not observed for kinematic parameters or braking and propulsive impulses. There were no significant differences between groups for voluntary visual sampling variables. These findings suggest that the visual control of locomotion in Parkinson's disease patients was similar to that observed in controls. Furthermore, Parkinson's disease patients were not more dependent on visual information than healthy individuals for the locomotion control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of vision in Parkinson's disease locomotion control: Obstacle crossing task
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective: Addressing the role of visual information in the control of obstacle crossing in people with Parkinson s disease, (PD). Background: Obstacle crossing deficits have been shown to increase risk of trips and falls in PD. Furthermore, the visual control of obstacle crossing in PD patients is not fully understood. Methods: Twelve healthy individuals and 12 PD patients under “on medication” status, (stages I-III of the Hoehn and Yahr Rating Scale) walked at their preferred speed along a walkway and stepped over an obstacle, (ankle height or half of the knee height), under three visual sampling conditions: dynamic, (normal lighting), static, (static visual samples) and voluntary visual sampling, (participants were allowed to choose when and where to take a visual sample of the environment). Subjects wore liquid crystal glasses for visual manipulation. Outcome measures included number of obstacle contacts, spatial-temporal parameters of obstacle avoidance, and number of samples and total duration of voluntary visual samples. Results: PDpatientsmademoreobstaclecontactsthancontrols only in static visual sampling condition. For successful trials, PD patients increased crossing step width in static visual sampling condition compared to dynamic and voluntary visual sampling conditions, while the control group maintained the same step width for all visual sampling conditions. Both PD patients and controls demonstrated a more conservative strategy, (i.e. greater leading toe clearance and step width values) during half of the knee height and static visual sampling conditions. PD patients showed lower horizontal mean velocity values during obstacle crossing than controls. There were no significant differences between groups for total duration of voluntary visual samples, but PD patients took less visual samples than controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that locomotor behavior of both groups was influenced by obstacle height and available visual sample. PD patients were more dependent on dynamic visual information than controls for task successful and postural stability. Brady- kinesia influenced obstacle crossing in PD patients.

TI  - The role of visual representation in physics learning: dynamic versus static visualization
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study aims to examine the role of visual representation in physics learning and to compare the learning outcomes of using dynamic and static visualization media. The study was conducted using quasi-experiment with Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design. The samples of this research are students of six classes at State Senior High School in Lampung Province. The experimental class received a learning using dynamic visualization and control class using static visualization media. Both classes are given pre-test and post-test with the same instruments. Data were tested with N-gain analysis, normality test, homogeneity test and mean difference test. The results showed that there was a significant increase of mean (N-Gain) learning outcomes (p <0.05) in both experimental and control classes. The averages of students' learning outcomes who are using dynamic visualization media are significantly higher than the class that obtains learning by using static visualization media. It can be seen from the characteristics of visual representation; each visualization provides different understanding support for the students. Dynamic visual media is more suitable for explaining material related to movement or describing a process, whereas static visual media is appropriately used for non-moving physical phenomena and requires long-term observation.

TI  - The rubber hand illusion depends on a congruent mapping between real and artificial fingers
PY  - 2014
AB  - The rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which a visible artificial hand is touched (or moves) synchronously with the participant's unseen own hand, indicates that body representations can undergo rapid changes. While several constraints for this illusion have been described, some reports highlight a remarkable flexibility of body representations, even contradicting a priori assumptions regarding body appearance and anatomy (e.g., the subjective embodiment of a third arm).Here we examine the impact of congruence between touches at (or movements of) the real and the artificial hand, as well as the role of predictability of touches (or movements). We implemented two versions of the RHI paradigm, based on passive tactile stimulation and active voluntary movements.The results show that (a) predictability does not modulate perceived embodiment, and that (b) congruent mapping between real and artificial fingers is a necessary condition for both the tactile and the motor RHI. Together with previously reported constraints for bodily illusions, these results are reduced to four principles, which determine subjective embodiment: temporal synchrony, congruence of mapping between real and artificial body parts, body unity and body shape. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The rubber hand illusion: Maintaining factors and a new perspective in rehabilitation and biomedical engineering?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Feelings of unrealistic body parts are related to deficits in human information processing and can occur as a part of phantom sensations after amputation [8]. Experimentally induced sensoric illusions like rubber hand illusion (RHI) [1] may help to understand basic information processing and could give new ideas for treatment or the rehabilitation process. Factors that are related to modulate sensoric illusions during movement may help to develop new intervention strategies in the rehabilitation of illusory symptoms. The goal of this study was to review the factors affecting persistence of the RHI effect during movement. We selected 13 keywords and searched in the following www.dimdi.de data bases (CCTR93, CDAR94, CDSR93, DAHTA, DAHTA, EA08, ED93, EM00, EM47, HG05, KP05, KR03, ME00, ME60, PI67, PY81, TV01, TVPP). A total of 160 articles were found. Duplicates were removed and the remaining list was filtered with the objective to explore the influence of active or passive movement during experimentally induced RHI. Then we identified six articles which experimentally examined persistence of RHI during active or passive movements. Results indicate that RHI are maintained during active or passive movements due to visual and temporal congruency. During active movements the RHI is more stable or global than in passive movements or during tactile stimulation. Factores like visual and temporal congruency are related to maintain RHI and are discussed in the rehabilitation of phantom sensations regarding new innovations in the design of prosthetics

TI  - The safety and effect of a bedside cycle ergometer on intracranial pressure in patients with an intraventricular catheter
PY  - 2015
AB  - Introduction Patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) are frequently confined to bedrest because of impaired consciousness, deficits in motor function, or the perceived risks associated with mobilization. Emerging evidence suggests that early mobilization of intensive care patients is safe and may improve short-term outcomes. In particular, low intensity passive stretch has been shown to successfully reduce some aspects of muscular atrophy. Our NICU early mobility task force recently acquired a bedside cycle ergometer in an effort to increase participation of our bedbound patients in both active and passive muscle activities. The present abstract provides a preliminary investigation on the safety and effects of a bedside cycle ergometer on intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with an intraventricular catheter (IVC). Methods Five neurocritically ill patients with an IVC were included in this study. The reason for IVC placement in all of these patients was for cerebrospinal fluid diversion due to increased intracranial pressure and resultant hydrocephalus. A bedside cycle ergometer (MOTOmed Letto 2, RECK-Technik GmbH & Co) with passive and/or active mobility settings was utilized by all five patients. ICP was monitored in at least 3 time points during each therapy session to ensure safety. The passive motion setting was applied in sedated, paretic or comatose patients, whereas alert and non-paretic subjects were asked to participate actively. Results All five of the patients who underwent therapy with the bedside cycle ergometer tolerated the therapy well. There were no noted increases of ICP during passive or active mobilizations. There were no IVC dislodgements or adverse effects of therapy. Conclusions This study is a preliminary investigation on the safety and effects on ICP in patients with an IVC. The bedside cycle ergometer appears to be a relatively safe instrument in the early mobilization of patients with an IVC.

TI  - The search for an architectural language of dynamic space derived from changing relationships among material, structure, space and style
PY  - 1993
AB  - "I cannot help searching for new images; and this I do, not for the sake of their novelty, but for the sake of finding an expression of the new outlook of the world around me."$\sp1$    In the historical development from a static to a dynamic perception of space, there are concomitant changes in the concept of architectural style. Materials become lighter, structures more kinetic; and spaces become less grounded, less bounded, and more energetic. The relationships among material, structural systems, space and style in the theories of Cesar Daly, Heinrich Hubsch and Viollet Le Duc are defined.    Beyond those static perceptions, this dissertation examines the expression of movement in architecture; particularly through the ideas of Le Corbusier and the Russian Constructivists. It discusses more advanced concepts of equilibrium, (dynamic equilibrium) and a new sense of weight, (anti-gravity architecture), which finally lead to a new concept of space that expresses the essence of movement.    The spiral structure and the inclined plane, are attempts in this direction, yielding a new concept of beauty based on movement and dynamism. The spatial solution and building theory that result from them diverge from the traditional horizontal and vertical architectural spaces, to create a dynamic, spiral space. This suggests a new ideology of movement and energy.    The aim is to present a new theory of design, based on mathematical formulations and lines of force, i.e., a vector analysis as proposed by Moisei Ginzburg, Paul Klee and Kostantin Melnikov among others. This establishes a new spatial configuration, derived from models of dynamic concepts in architecture. Energy is the basic element of this language, since it is capable of articulating the emerging concepts of force and dynamic space in architectural form. It moves from a static to dynamic perception of space, and attempts to predict a new architecture whose major geometric expression is the spiral. In this new language, we begin to see the seeds of a new architectural style, in resonance with its time. ftn$\sp1$Naum Gabo.

TI  - The shoulder
PY  - 2008
AB  - The shoulder joint is the commonest joint examined sonographically, and is often the first joint on which most imagers are introduced to musculoskeletal ultrasound. The shoulder is superficial and readily accessible to ultrasound assessment and is excellent for assessing the normal anatomy and pathology of the shoulder joint; it has sensitivities and specificities in assessment of the rotator cuff that are comparable to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound offers excellent resolution, is multiplanar, accessible, and cost efficient. One of ultrasound's main strengths is its ability to image in real time the normal dynamic motion of joints and surrounding soft tissues. This dynamic component of the study may expose pathologies not apparent in a static examination. © 2008 Springer-Verlag New York.

TI  - The significance and shifts in meaning of the concept ‘environment' in Polish social pedagogy - theory and practice
PY  - 2018
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze social environment concept (the key to polish social pedagogy). ‘Environment’ is a central term in Polish social pedagogy. Its conceptualization, which was introduced by Helena Radlińska in the beginning of the twentieth century, allowed social pedagogy to constitute a separate scientific discipline. As the discipline developed over eighty years, this interpretation of the environment concept also evolved. The changing interpretation brought epistemological and methodological consequences which affected the research of social life and pedagogical practice as well. In the introduction to the paper I shall make a short presentation of Helena Radlińska’s ‘environment’ concept, highlighting its main assumptions. I shall shortly introduce three of these assumptions, more specifically discussing the objective and subjective dimensions of the environment. Then I will present the sharp, postwar turn towards positivistic interpretations, in which the environment is understood as an external condition to the person, which defines his or her life (increasing popularity of the educational environment concept). Finally, I will show the contemporary shift from static to the dynamic perception of the environment. Juxtaposed with the shifts in meaning of the concept of an environment, I shall discuss the ideas of the educational environment and learning environment, as outcomes of the above shifts. I’ll also present the theoretical and practical consequences of the different understanding of the term environment.

AB  - Respiratory gymnastics, active and passive movements, exercise against resistance, circulatory training, training of equilibrium, sitting-, standing- and walking exercises are the components of the initial treatment phase for adjustment of patients with recent paraplegia to the physical injury and constitute an indispensible prerequisite to gradually increasing more strenuous sport therapy. Sport increases both control of the body and physical fitness. The spared musculature is being tonified and 'overcompensated'. Sports types with emphasis on the static and kinetic equilibratory functions are available. Self-confidence and team-spirit are promoted. The object is not the achievement of peak performances but the execution of regular sporting activities. To this end, special sport groups for wheelchair patients are particularly suitable following their discharge.

TI  - The social buffering of pain by affective touch: a laser-evoked potential study in romantic couples
PY  - 2018
AB  - Pain is modulated by social context. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that romantic partners can provide a potent form of social support during pain. However, such studies have only focused on passive support, finding a relatively late-onset modulation of pain-related neural processing. In this study, we examined for the first time dynamic touch by one's romantic partner as an active form of social support. Specifically, 32 couples provided social, active, affective (vs active but neutral) touch according to the properties of a specific C-tactile afferent pathway to their romantic partners, who then received laser-induced pain. We measured subjective pain ratings and early N1 and later N2-P2 laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to noxious stimulation, as well as individual differences in adult attachment style. We found that affective touch from one's partner reduces subjective pain ratings and similarly attenuates LEPs both at earlier (N1) and later (N2-P2) stages of cortical processing. Adult attachment style did not affect LEPs, but attachment anxiety had a moderating role on pain ratings. This is the first study to show early neural modulation of pain by active, partner touch, and we discuss these findings in relation to the affective and social modulation of sensory salience.

TI  - The spatio-temporal dynamics of deviance and target detection in the passive and active auditory oddball paradigm: a sLORETA study
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Numerous studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of passive and active deviance and target detection in the well-known auditory oddball paradigm by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present auditory oddball study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of passive versus active deviance and target detection by analyzing amplitude modulations of early and late ERPs while at the same time exploring the neural sources underling this modulation with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA).Methods: A 64-channel EEG was recorded from twelve healthy right-handed participants while listening to'standards' and 'deviants' (500 vs. 1000 Hz pure tones) during a passive (block 1) and an active (block 2) listening condition. During passive listening, participants had to simply listen to the tones. During active listening they had to attend and press a key in response to the deviant tones.Results: Passive and active listening elicited an N1 component, a mismatch negativity (MMN) as difference potential (whose amplitudes were temporally overlapping with the N1) and a P3 component. N1/MMN and P3 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced for deviants as compared to standards during both listening conditions. Active listening augmented P3 modulation to deviants significantly compared to passive listening, whereas deviance detection as indexed by N1/MMN modulation was unaffected by the task. During passive listening, sLORETA contrasts (deviants >standards) revealed significant activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the lingual gyri bilaterally (N1/MMN) as well as in the left and right insulae (P3). During active listening, significant activations were found for the N1/MMN in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and for the P3 in multiple cortical regions (e.g., precuneus).Discussion: The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that passive as well as active deviance and target detection elicit cortical activations in spatially distributed brain regions and neural networks including the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and salience network (SN). Based on the temporal activation of the neural sources underlying ERP modulations, a neurophysiological model of passive and active deviance and target detection is proposed which can be tested in future studies.

TI  - The special skills of listening
PY  - 1993
AB  - For facilitators, there are probably 6 main situations in which they will have to listen: 1. monologue, 2. dialogue, 3. conversation, 4. discussion, 5. debate, and 6. argument. In all 6 situations, facilitators can choose the level at which they listen. Other members of the group will also be choosing the level at which they listen, and it is helpful for facilitators to be aware of this as well. Listening can be divided into 8 levels: 1. non-listening, 2. passive listening, 3. judgemental listening, 4. attentive listening, 5. visual listening, 6. reflective listening, 7. active/creative listening, and 8. directive listening. It is not sufficient for facilitators simply to listen attentively and visually. It is also important to clarify what is being said by reflective listening, and to watch to see what other levels of listening are occurring in the group. This combination of listening to speakers and being aware of the listening that others are doing is what is described as facilitative listening. It calls for a very high degree of concentration and awareness of what is happening in the group.

TI  - The spiral flap for fingertip resurfacing: Short-term and long-term results
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose We describe a homodigital neurovascular island flap for reconstructing large pulp defects of the fingertips and review the short-term and long-term appearance and function of the reconstructed fingertips.Methods The spiralflap is a homodigital neurovascular island flap with a unique spiral advancement and transposition design that allows pulp reconstruction using sensate glabrous skin while restricting donor morbidity to the injured digit. Thirty-two fingertips were resurfaced using this flap. All had large pulp defects averaging 1.2 cm wide x 2.0 cm long (1.0 -2.0 cm x 1.5-2.5 cm). Short-term results ( 18 months) for all patients at a minimum of 6 months and long-term results (>5 years) for 10 patients with a mean follow-up of 13 years were reviewed. Objective outcome measures included static 2-point discrimination, degree of nail deformity (beaking), total active motion, and hypersensitivity or cold intolerance. Subjective outcome measures included patient satisfaction with function and aesthetics, using a visual analog scale.Results All flaps achieved primary healing with no complications. There was initially mild extension deficit in the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints, which improved to full range of motion in the long term. Sensory recovery was excellent, with an average 2-point discrimination of 5 mm initially, improving to 4 mm in the long term. Nail beaking was minimal initially but increased significantly in the long term. These results may be explained by soft tissue remodeling. All patients on long-term follow-up were highly satisfied with both aesthetic and functional outcome. There was no hypersensitivity or cold intolerance at either the short-term or long-term follow-up assessments.Conclusions The spiral advancement-transposition flap is suitable for resurfacing large pulp defects with excellent short-term and long-term functional and aesthetic results and high patient satisfaction.

TI  - The stiff elbow.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Elbow motion is essential for upper extremity function to position the hand in space. Unfortunately, the elbow joint is prone to stiffness following a multitude of traumatic and atraumatic etiologies. Elbow stiffness can be diagnosed with a complete history and physical exam, supplemented with appropriate imaging studies. The stiff elbow is challenging to treat, and thus, its prevention is of paramount importance. When this approach fails, non-operative followed by operative treatment modalities should be pursued. Upon initial presentation in those who have minimal contractures of 6-month duration or less, static and dynamic splinting, serial casting, continuous passive motion, occupational/physical therapy, and manipulation are non-operative treatment modalities that may be attempted. A stiff elbow that is refractory to non-operative management can be treated surgically, either arthroscopically or open, to eliminate soft tissue or bony blocks to motion. In the future, efforts to prevent and treat elbow stiffness may target the basic science mechanisms involved. Our purpose was to review the etiologies, classification, evaluation, prevention, operative, and non-operative treatment of the stiff elbow.

TI  - The structure of aesthetical experience in the Kumdo spectator
PY  - 2011
AB  - The purpose of this study is to delineate the structure of aesthetic experience of occurring in Kumdo aesthetics from a viewpoint of the spectator. The aesthetic experience holding Kumdo's spectator is one of many methods to appreciate the essence of Kumdo. The results of this thesis are as follows: First, the foundation of aesthetic understanding in the sport spectator is aesthetic disinterestedness. This is perfect attitude excluded the subjective interests. Second, the elements of aesthetic experience in subjective spectator are aesthetic intuition and aesthetic affection. As connected the aesthetic values in showing aesthetic object, the subjective attitude makes the structure of aesthetic experience in aesthetic experience. Kumdo's spectator recognizes the movement of Kumdo's performer through beauty of type, beauty of content and beauty of skill. The beauty of type in Kumdo is to experience the combination between static and dynamic movement. The beauty of content in Kumdo is to grasp the external, psychological elements involving the form, atmosphere in Kumdo, The beauty of skill is to experience the works of swords and result of it. Spectator must experience 'external taste' in their beauties. Spectator must experience the beauty of art, beauty of character, and beauty of life and death in those of type. The beauty of art is to find out the unification of Ki(氣), Jian(劍), and Ti(體). The beauty of life and death is to really feel the living and fear in Kumdo competition and movement. The beauty of character is to grasp the personality effused in the process of cultivation for a long time. Those are to feel 'immanent taste' in Kumdo. In conclusion, the completion of aesthetic experience possesses 'external taste' and 'immanent taste' at the same time.

TI  - The structure of an active acoustic metamaterial with tunable effective density
PY  - 2009
AB  - A new class of one-dimensional active acoustic metamaterials (AAMMs) with programmable effective densities is presented. The proposed AAMM is capable of producing densities that are orders of magnitudes lower or higher than the ambient fluid. Such characteristics are achieved by using an array of fluid cavities separated by piezoelectric diaphragms that are controlled to generate constant densities over wide frequency bands. The piezodiaphragms are augmented with passive electrical components to broaden the operating frequency bandwidth and enable densities higher than the fluid medium to be generated. The use of these components is shown to be essential to maintain the closed-loop compliance of the piezodiaphragm away from the zone of elastic instabilities. The values of the passive components are selected on a rational basis in order to ensure a balance between the frequency bandwidth and control voltage. With this unique structure of the AAMM, physically realizable acoustic cloaks can be implemented and objects treated with these active metamaterials can become acoustically invisible.

TI  - The subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease: somatotopic organization and physiological characteristics
PY  - 2001
AB  - Single-cell recording of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was undertaken in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease submitted to surgery. Three hundred and fifty neurones were recorded and assessed for their response to passive and active movements. Thirty-two per cent were activated by passive and active movement of the limbs, oromandibular region and abdominal wall. All neurones with sensorimotor responses were in the dorsolateral region of the STN. Arm-related neurones were lateral (greater than or equal to 14 mm plane) to leg-related neurones, which were found more medially (less than or equal to 12 mm). Representation of the oromandibular musculature was in the middle of the sensorimotor region (similar to 13 mm plane) and ventral to the arm and leg. Two hundred neurones were adequately isolated for `off-line' analysis. The mean frequency of discharge was 33 +/- 17 Hz (13-117 Hz). Three types of neuronal discharges were distinguished: irregular (60.5%), tonic (24%) and oscillatory (15.5 %). They were statistically differentiated on the basis of their mean firing frequency and the coefficient of variation of the interspike interval. Neurones responding to movement were of the irregular or tonic type, and were found in the dorsolateral region of the STN. Neurones with oscillatory and low frequency activity did not respond to movement and were in the ventral one-third of the nucleus. Thirty-eight tremor-related neurones were recorded. The majority (84%) of these were sensitive to movement and were located in the dorsolateral region of the STN. Cross power analysis (n = 16) between the rhythmic neuronal activity and tremor in the limbs showed a peak frequency of 5 Hz (4-8 Hz). Neuronal activity of the subtantia nigra pars reticulata was recorded 0.5-3 mm below the STN. Eighty neurones were recorded `on-line' and 27 were isolated for `off-line' analysis. A tonic pattern of discharge characterized by a mean firing rate of 71 +/- 28 Hz (35-122 Hz) with a mean coefficient of variation of the interspike interval of 0.85 +/- 0.29 ms was found. In only three neurones (11%) was there a response to sensorimotor stimulation. The findings of this study indicate that the somatotopic arrangement and electrophysiological features of the STN in Parkinson's disease patients are similar to those found in monkeys.

TI  - The temperature dependence of chloride fluxes in the squid giant axon
PY  - 1975
AB  - The influx and efflux of radioactive chloride was measured in intact squid giant axons. In the resting axon the rate of efflux was 2.8 x 10-4 min-1 at room temperature. When the temperature was decreased the efflux decreased with a Q10 of 1.3. There was no detectable extra efflux associated with nerve impulses. The resting influx at room temperature was 14 p moles/cm2-sec and this decreased as the temperature was lowered. The Q10 for the resting influx was found to be 2.4. There was an extra influx of chloride associated with nerve impulses of 0.08 p moles/cm2-imp at room temperature and this increased as the temperature was lowered with a Q10 of 1/1.3. The ratio of the resting fluxes (influx/efflux) at low temperatures approaches what would be expected for independent, passive movement of the ion whereas at room temperature the ratio is clearly too large. The high temperature dependence of the resting influx and the flux ratio calculations support the idea that there is an inwardly directed active transport mechanism for chloride ions in the squid axon membrane. The low temperature dependence of the extra chloride influx associated with nerve impulses is consistent with the low temperature dependence of the extra fluxes of sodium and potassium.

TI  - The temporal resolution and frequency selectivity in sensorineral hearing loss patients and cochlear implanted patients
PY  - 2002
AB  - The pure tone audiogram (PTA), speech intelligibility, temporal resolution and frequency selectivity were measured for the moderate sensorineural hearing loss patients. The temporal resolution was measured by the method of gap detection test in broadband noise. The frequency selectivity was measured in accordance with Zwicker's method. And then the relationship between speech intelligibility and those parameters was studied. There was a wide varied relationship between PTA and the speech intelligibility. The data in this study showed that the temporal resolution was much more important than the frequency selectivity to hear words. The temporal resolution was also detected in eight persons who wore the cochlear implants. There was good relationship between the temporal resolution and the intelligibility of consonance. The temporal resolution seemed to depend on the number of residual cochlear neurons. Lastly I refer that the PTA represents only the static auditory function and that the parameters like the temporal resolution or frequency selectivity seems to be much more important to perceive speech because those parameters represents the dynamic cochlear function. In case of fitting of hearing aids, one should recognize the PTA is a only part of cochlear function.

TI  - The temporal stability of visuomotor adaptation generalization
PY  - 2017
AB  - Movement adaptation in response to systematic motor perturbations exhibits distinct spatial and temporal properties. These characteristics are typically studied in isolation, leaving the interaction largely unknown. Here we examined how the temporal decay of visuomotor adaptation influences the spatial generalization of the motor recalibration. First, we quantified the extent to which adaptation decayed over time. Subjects reached to a peripheral target, and a rotation was applied to the visual feedback of the unseen motion. The retention of this adaptation over different delays (0-120 s) 1) decreased by 29.0 +/- 6.8% at the longest delay and 2) was represented by a simple exponential, with a time constant of 22.5 +/- 5.6 s. On the basis of this relationship we simulated how the spatial generalization of adaptation would change with delay. To test this directly, we trained additional subjects with the same perturbation and assessed transfer to 19 different locations (spaced 15 degrees apart, symmetric around the trained location) and examined three delays (similar to 4, 12, and 25 s). Consistent with the simulation, we found that generalization around the trained direction (+/- 15 degrees) significantly decreased with delay and distance, while locations >60 degrees displayed near-constant spatiotemporal transfer. Intermediate distances (30 degrees and 45 degrees) showed a difference in transfer across space, but this amount was approximately constant across time. Interestingly, the decay at the trained direction was faster than that based purely on time, suggesting that the spatial transfer of adaptation is modified by concurrent passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) processes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Short-term motor adaptation exhibits distinct spatial and temporal characteristics. Here we investigated the interaction of these features, utilizing a simple motor adaptation paradigm (recalibration of reaching arm movements in response to rotated visual feedback). We examined the changes in the spatial generalization of motor adaptation for different temporal manipulations and report that the spatiotemporal generalization of motor adaptation is generally local and is influenced by both passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) learning processes.

PY  - 1970
AB  - Sunflowers growing in water culture solution containing only six ions (K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cl − , and NO 3 − ) were decapitated and the exudate was allowed to accumulate in vinyl tubes. Measurements of biopotential, exudation rate, and ion concentration in the exudate and the nutrient medium were made at 4-h intervals during the 32-h period after detopping. The exudation rate, fluxes for each ion, biopotentials, and Δ E values for each ion were plotted on a time axis. With the fluxratio equation, chloride, nitrate, and potassium were observed to be entering actively, whereas for the other cations the gradient inward was passive. The active or passive movement for each ion and the diurnal cycles in exudation and ion fluxes changed as time after detopping increased. These changes might be accounted for in terms of the effects of detopping which remove the supply of energy compounds necessary for the normal functioning of the root.

PY  - 2009
AB  - In more than 80% of all burns, the hand is involved. Even if a burned hand does not play a major role for the survival of a patient, its function and aesthetic appearance are of utmost importance for the re-integration into society and professional life. Adequate treatment demands a number of major decisions: necessity of an escharotomy in the early post-traumatic phase, the timing of surgery and the type of wound coverage, as well as immobilization and rehabilitation.Rapid wound closure is of utmost importance, but infection control and the preservation of active and passive motion are also essential for optimal recovery of the injured hand. The treatment of hand burns requires the interdisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, physio- and occupational therapists, psychologists, motivated health care personnel and consequent treatment strategies.

Return of useful function and range of motion can also be achieved in 75% to 90% by early active exercises, physiotherapy, and occasional continuous passive motion, supported by hinged braces or cast braces in the postoperative period until union occurs. Union was achieved in an average of 6.6 months after the operative procedure.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Seventeen General Practitioners entered 121 patients into a randomized double-blind, parallel group study comparing mefenamic acid (Ponstan Forte®) and naproxen (Naprosyn®) in the management of osteo-arthritis. Patients received treatment for eight weeks with either mefenamic acid (500 mg t.d.s.) or naproxen (500 mg b.d.). Assessments of joint pain were made at baseline, after four weeks and after eight weeks using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Joint pain on standing, on walking, at night, and on passive movement were also assessed at each visit. At baseline and at the end of the eight-week study the patients' quality of life was assessed with particular reference to their mobility. At the end of the active treatment phase, overall efficacy of the medications, and tolerance to them, was assessed by both the patient and the physician. Mefenamic acid and naproxen were equally effective in relieving the painful symptoms of osteo-arthritis and in improving the patient's quality of life. At the end of the eight-week treatment period patients and their physicians reported that mefenamic acid was better tolerated than naproxen. Thirty adverse events were reported in 21 patients in the mefenamic acid group and 47 in 26 patients in the naproxen group. In both groups 13 patients had events which resulted in the treatment being stopped prior to the end of the study.

What is essential in terms of static and dynamic resolution of the simulated visual system for proper pilot training in tactical combat missions is described in this paper, around a spectrum of highly relevant conjectures such as the physical limit of computer processing, innovations in digital image processing, and the speed of perception in visual information processing by the human brain. © 1980 SPIE.

TI  - The unassisted visual system on earth and in space
PY  - 2010
AB  - Chuck Oman has been a guide and mentor for research in human perception and performance during space exploration for over 25 years. His research has provided a solid foundation for our understanding of how humans cope with the challenges and ambiguities of sensation and perception in space. In many of the environments associated with work in space the human visual system must operate with unusual combinations of visual and other perceptual cues. On Earth physical acceleration cues are normally available to assist the visual system in interpreting static and dynamic visual features. Here we consider two cases where the visual system is not assisted by such cues. Our first experiment examines perceptual stability when the normally available physical cues to linear acceleration are absent. Our second experiment examines perceived orientation when there is no assistance from the physically sensed direction of gravity. In both cases the effectiveness of vision is paradoxically reduced in the absence of physical acceleration cues. The reluctance to rely heavily on vision represents an important human factors challenge to efficient performance in the space environment.

PY  - 2008
AB  - During the breeding season, harp seals are acoustically active under water and exhibit high calling rates. The underwater locations of seals in three dimensions were studied using a 4 hydrophone passive acoustic method near the Magdalen Islands, QC. Calibration tones determined the underwater transmission losses. Sound transmission was highly variable and reduced the ability of the array to localize calling seals beyond 20 m from the array. Most seals calls were located along the periphery of the ice floes and in open water, but not usually under large floes. Most calls were detected underneath the array. Source levels varied with call type (mean ranges 129 -151 dB re 1μPa –m) with the highest value being 180 dB re 1μPa –m. Monte Carlo models of communication ranges for the call types for a quiet sea indicated median distances of 526 to 5518 m (maximum 50 km). Median communication distances in the presence of other calling seals dropped to 129 to 153 m (maximum 5 km).

TI  - The unstable metacarpophalangeal joint in rheumatoid arthritis: Anatomy, pathomechanics, and physical rehabilitation considerations
PY  - 2005
AB  - The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints bestow important strength to the longitudinal and transverse arch systems of the hand. in addition, these joints guide active movements of the fingers in 2 degrees of freedom, while allowing sufficient laxity for passive accessory motions. Both stability and mobility functions are attained in the healthy hand by a complex interaction among the muscles and the joints' periarticular connective tissues. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often causes destruction of the MCP joints' connective tissues, which leads to weakness of the tissues and an imbalance of active and passive forces, and subsequently, instability, pain, and deformity. The 2 most common deformities of the MCP joints associated with RA and instability are palmar subluxation and ulnar "drift." Therapists and physicians often collaborate to treat these conditions through a combination of surgical and nonsurgical interventions. Two of the more conservative nonsurgical interventions typically involve a combination of splinting and education on joint protection. Additional nonsurgical treatment may include the judicious use of exercise and methods for relieving pain and reducing inflammation. Surgical intervention is often indicated when the more conservative treatments fail to arrest the progression of the pain or deformity. Regardless of the specific approach, effective intervention for instability of the MCP joint requires that the clinician possess a sound knowledge of the anatomy and the pathomechanical influences that predispose or cause the instability. This clinical commentary is intended to provide this information, as well as offer treatment guidelines based on our clinical experience. Whenever possible, research will be cited to support clinical interventions. This paper is especially geared to the therapist who may not currently specialize in the treatment of instability of the MCP joint hut may require basic information on this important topic.

TI  - The unsteady behavior of subsonic wind tunnel wall pressure during pitching motion of the model
PY  - 2014
AB  - Extensive low speed wind tunnel experiments have been undertaken to measure the test section, floor wall pressure distribution, in the presence of a 2D wing inside the test section. The experiments were performed for both the static and dynamic pitching motion of the model under different conditions. In these measurements, the effects of the existence and oscillations of a 2D wing on the floor wall pressure at various locations were studied. According to the results, as the oscillation parameters, such as mean angle of attack and frequency, change, wall pressures at the points located in the front part of the test section, in the upstream region, exhibit different behavior from those in the downstream. Viscosity is shown to be a major contributor in convecting fluctuations, caused by model oscillations, to the flowfleld. As the Reynolds number increases, the downstream region receives fewer disturbances from the pure dynamic motion of the model.

TI  - The use of Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) in the rehabilitation of patients after total knee arthroplasty.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Background. Total knee alloplasty (TKA) is standard treatment for advanced gonarthrosis. Proper rehabilitation of the operated joint and the patient is essential in order to achieve a satisfactory functional outcome. The aim of our study was to compare rehabilitation methods used for patients recovering from TKA in the Orthopedic Clinic of the Medical University in Lodz, Poland. Material and methods. We studied 186 patients operated for advanced gonarthrosis, ranging in age from 29 to 80 (average 65.8), who had received 197 endoprotheses. From 1986 to 1989 the rehabilitation program included isometric exercises of the muscles in the operated joint, general fitness exercises in bed, and passive exercises of the knee conducted by a physiotherapist. The average stay during this period was 19.7 +/- 2.5 days. In 1989, continuous passive motion (CPM) using an electric rail was introduced to the rehabilitation program. Results. Thanks to the earlier additional flexibility of the operated joint, active exercises and weight bearing on the operated limb could be accelerated. The patients left the Clinic 2 weeks after surgery (13.6 +/- 2.5 days). The change in the rehabilitation program produced a statistically significant increase in the average range of flexion in the operated joint (p = 0.000001) in a significantly shorter time (p = 0.0000). Conclusion. Introducing CPM to the rehabilitation of TKA patients accelerates their progress and reduces hospitalization time, which improves the patients' emotional comfort and enables a faster return to an active life in society.

TI  - The use of Geographic Information System in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to apply Geographic Information System (GIS) in the development and utilization of Chinese ancient local chronicles to achieve the mining and visualization of historical data about products distribution and dispersal in Products in Local Chronicles of Guangdong.Design/methodology/approach - Using 1,756 records of product-related location names in Products in Local Chronicles of Guangdong of the Qing dynasty, which are recognized by a name recognition system, as attribute data; taking the spatial data of Chinese administrative geography of the Qing dynasty in 1820 and the Historical Atlas of China as spatial data; connect the attribute data with relevant spatial data based on the table connection function of Arcmap in Arcgis 8.3 to implement the data management, cartography and analysis.Findings - The application of GIS in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles was quite successful. With some thematic maps, knowledge about products distribution and dispersal in ancient books was vividly displayed so as to facilitate relevant researches.Research limitations/implications - Only product-related location names inside China were analyzed, not other named entities in local chronicles; and only static visual display was achieved, not dynamic visual display. Historical maps of the world can be used to carry out the visualization of the products distribution and dispersal in the world, and even the visualization of other knowledge, such as poetries and songs scattered over many places in China. The process of products dispersal and the distribution of poetries and songs can be dynamically and visually displayed by pictures, audios, videos, multimedia, etc.Practical implications - By using GIS in the development and utilization of Chinese ancient local chronicles, this paper explores a new way for the collation of ancient books and open up a new area for the research of digital humanities.Originality/value - This is the first try about the application of GIS in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles, and also the same of digital humanities research in the field of agricultural history.

TI  - The use of feedback in scheduling parallel computations
PY  - 1997
AB  - This paper discusses the use of run-time feedback for optimizing the execution of parallel computations. Four levels of feedback are distinguished, and the applicability and limitations of each are discussed. A two-part scheduling paradigm known as SEDIA (Static Exploration/Dynamic Instantiation and Activation) that addresses these limitations to perform robust scheduling in the presence of variant run-time behavior is introduced. A key component of this scheduling paradigm is an abstract model of run-rime information fidelity which has evolved from our previous work in the area of Trace Recovery, employing control-theoretic concepts.

TI  - The use of somatic training to improve pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis alignment during quiet stance and dynamic dance movement.
PY  - 1997
AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and incorporate a valid and reliable measurement protocol to quantify improvement in pelvic tilt (PelT) and lumbar lordosis (LL) alignment from somatic training. The first series of studies assessed whether PelT and LL were valid and reliable measures of lower spine and pelvic alignment. These studies also determined a tempo for timing execution of dynamic movements and checked for a testing effect from repeated trials in a given day. The next two studies examined the effect of dance technique training and somatic training on PelT and LL during quiet stance and dynamic dance movement. The final study utilized a multiple baseline design to assess the effect of somatic training on PelT and LL during quiet stance and dynamic dance movement. PelT and LL were found to be valid measures during static assessment of normal and extreme ranges of lumbar-pelvic motion, since the results demonstrated the anticipated increase or decrease for each condition. A challenging yet executable tempo (90 beats per minute) was chosen to maintain consistent timing execution across dynamic conditions. PelT and LL were stable across repeated trials on a given day. Test-retest reliability across days was indicated for both PelT and LL. There were no improvements found in PelT and LL with dance technique training. One subject actually had a higher degree of posttest lumbar lordosis during quiet stance and a dynamic condition (e.g., by 3.9 degrees and 4.3 degrees respectively). Improvements in LL were indicated with somatic training for all three subjects in almost all conditions (e.g., for Subject 1/Condition 1: 45.2 +/- .71 degrees pre vs. 32.6 +/- 3.4 degrees post). A multiple baseline assessment revealed a testing effect for PelT across multiple days. An independent (sometimes inverse) relationship between PelT and LL was indicated for all six subjects. Alignment improvement with somatic training was subjectively observed in all subjects. PelT and LL provided a limited assessment of different alignment strategies between conditions. Repeated testing may have been a stronger agent for PelT and LL changes than training. [Scientific symbols modified where possible in accordance with CINAHL policy]

TI  - The use of virtuality in car development
PY  - 2000
AB  - For many years in car development the future customer was first represented by templates. Today and in fact for a long time now CAD tools are solely used for designing a car and therefore man had to be integrated into that environment as well. 1986 the German car industry joined in a research program to produce a common man model for the use in automotive design. This program called RAMSIS has been in practical use at BMW since the early nineties. All "static" situations can be assessed with RAMSIS today including dynamic movements of arms and legs. For entry and egress and for the final confirmation, three dimensional mock-ups are tested by a number of in-house test subjects. Their body dimensions have to be known in order to compare their assessments with the customer population. Therefore we regularly measure members of the research and development center using all methods, from the conventional yardstick to current laser scanning techniques. Hand in hand with DMU methods Virtual Reality has gained access to development processes. The goal of DMU, to eliminate the time consuming and expensive hardware loops and replace them as much as possible by digital models, is effectively supported by VR techniques that speed up processes by enhancing the man-machine-interaction. There is a wide range of application fields to use these techniques, e.g. design review, assembly and maintenance simulation and training. RAMSIS is integrated in the BMW VR environment with special extensions to allow immersive ergonomic research. Mixed mock-up applications are used to have virtual experiences, to verify or to train assembly procedures at an early stage of development and therefore eliminate problems as soon as possible. New concepts can be evaluated and assessed taking ergonomic aspects and disturbing influences into account.

TI  - The utilization of functional infrared imaging signature index protocols in staging patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
PY  - 2012
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a neuropathic pain disorder with significant autonomic features characterized by regional pain. CRPS usually develops after an initiating noxious event, is not limited to the distribution of a single peripheral nerve, and appears to be disproportionate to the inciting event. The autonomic features are commonly manifested in the distal aspect of an affected extremity or with a distal to proximal gradient in the affected extremity This poorly understood disease is the result of a multi-factorial interplay between altered somato-sensory, motor, autonomic and inflammatory systems associated with peripheral and central sensitization. DIAGNOSIS of CRPS is based upon patient history and evaluation of presenting clinical signs and symptoms. CPRS patients commonly experience hyperalgesia, allodynia, spontaneous pain, abnormal skin color, changes in skin temperature, abnormal sudomotor activity; edema, active and passive movement disorders and trophic changes of nails and hair. Sudomotor/ sweating limb differences and atrophic changes, including nail, hair and skin changes, occur in less than half of the clinical CRPS patients. In contrast, verified temperature asymmetry, edema, and decreased motor function are frequently cited as predictive. Historically, CRPS possibly to occur in three (3) distinct pathophysiological stages: Stage I Acute-Hyperemic, Stage 2 Dystrophic-Ischemic, and Stage 3 Atrophic. Recent literature suggests that these individual stages are not absolute and in fact, may not all be observed in any single patient. Signs and symptoms fluctuate over time and are reflective of ongoing dynamicneuroplastic changes in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. More recent descriptors of CRPS have used the terms "warm CRPS" (acute) denoting cases with initial increased temperature and edema stages and "cold CRPS" (chronic) denoting cases with the affected limb having a cooler temperature with decreased edema. CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CRPS by the International As- sociation for the Study of Pain is thought to be overly sensitive and is problematic in differentiating between those patients with other pain complaints and those with actual CRPS. Utilizing clinical criteria alone to diagnose CRPS in many cases is not dependable nor necessarily reliable. Therefore, objective testing to evaluate the integrity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is required. Infrared Imaging (IR) effectively detects the thermal signature of vasomotor disturbances that are an im- portant factor in establishing the diagnosis. Bruehl et al. de- monstrated a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 67% in evaluating thermal asymmetries in patients with CRPS. Wasner et al. showed a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 93% by evaluating computer generated side-to-side temperature differences of homologous body regions following controlled alteration of sympathetic activity The use of quantitative temperature differences alone lacks diagnostic specificity because numerous pathologies produce skin temperature asymmetry. For example, temperature asymmetry occurs in focal inflammation and vascular disease. Moreover, thermal asymmetry can result from somato-autonomic vasoconstriction secondary to acute trauma, limb immobilization, fracture, anti-dromic vasodilatation from small fiber distal neuropathy, and neuropathic pain with sympathetic activity. Gulevich et al. demonstrated a 93% sensitivity and 89% specificity by incorporating functional infrared imaging protocols (see below). fIR SIGNATURE INDICES: Functional Infrared Imaging (fIR) does not merely measure limb temperature. The infrared study is significantly enhanced when the JR data is interfaced with software that enables the examiner to obtain the following fIR signature indices: (1) Qualitative JR signatures (temperature map), (2) computer generated side-to-side quantitative temperature differences, (3) statistical evaluation of the integrity (i.e., normality vs. abnormality) of distal thermal gradient IR signatures and (4) response to cold-water autonomic functional stress testing. These separate and distinct JR signature indices assist the highly trained and experienced examiner in identifying the stages of CRPS (i.e., "warm CRPS" vs. "cold CRPS" vs. transitional stages). An understanding of the capabilities and limitations of JR technology is critical to establishing its significance in detecting physiological changes that are relevant and meaningful to the diagnosis of CRPS. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms are involved in CRPS. As the condition evolves, there are distinct alterations in the manifestation of the pathophysiology. The impacts on the SNS by alterations in the pathophysiological mechanisms are identifiable by careful observation of the changes in the IR signatures of four (4) separate and distinct indices. The JR signature indices are helpful in identifying both the warm CRPS, transitional and cold CRPS stages. The warm CRPS (acute hyperemic) stage, with accompanied pathophysiological changes that include neurogenic inflammation, altered systemic levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, pro-inflammatory neuropeptides, dysfunctional SNS thermal regulatory activity (decreased SNS outflow) and absent vasoconstriction to cold water autonomic functional stress testing is evidenced by the JR emission visualized in the four distinct fIR signature indices. The cold CRPS (chronic dystrophic/atrophic) stage with the accompanied pathophysiological changes that include dysfunctional SNS thermal regulatory activity (increased SNS outflow), hypersensitivity to circulating catecholamine, altered SNS activity in contralateral asymptomatic extremity and exaggerated vasoconstriction response to cold water autonomic functional stress testing is evidenced by the JR emission visualized in the four distinct fIR signature indices. CONCLUSION: The warm stage, transitional stage and cold CRPS stage may be identified by carefully interpreting the four separate and distinct JR signature indices obtained with functional JR imaging. This author posits, IR protocols for evaluating patients with presumptive CRPS include the four fIR signature indices to obtain optimal SNS functional data. This objective SNS data will assist the clinician in identifying real time pathophysiological mechanisms (CRPS stage) that are instrumental in achieving the goal of mechanism based CRPS diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - The validity of stimulus-evoked EMG for studying muscle fatigue characteristics of paraplegic subjects during dynamic cycling movement.
PY  - 1997
AB  - The fatigue characteristics of paralyzed muscles were investigated during dynamic cycling movement induced by functional electrical stimulation (FES). The peak-to-peak (PTP) amplitude of stimulus-evoked electromyogram (EMG), after suppression of stimulus artifact, was adopted as fatigue indicator. Compared to static contraction, the effects of dynamic movement factors on the stimulus-evoked EMG, such as the intermittent stimulation, joint angle, and contraction speed, were first evaluated in separate experiments. The results of isolated tests laid the foundation for interpreting the data obtained in two FES-cycling experiments, performed under maximum stimulation or in controlled cycling speeds. The effects of intermittent stimulation and joint angle caused periodic changes in PTP amplitude which can be alleviated by averaging the PTP amplitude of one cycle. Under the same stimulation intensity, our results indicated that slower muscle contraction speed would have larger PTP amplitude and vice versa. For the limited number of subjects with paraplegia studied, our results showed that the use of EMG PTP as reliable muscle fatigue indicator during dynamic movement is only valid at the same cycling speed or corresponding contraction speed. The decline of the PTP amplitude decreased with the decay of muscle force can be observed during cycling movement; however, reduction of cycling speed had the opposite effect on PTP amplitude. Observations from the hyperbolic modeling of fatigue process demonstrated that the EMG PTP of a fatigued muscle under dynamic movement decreased at a slower rate.

AB  - According to information processing theory, attention deficits appear to be a nuclear disorder in schizophrenia which the study has been renewed with the development of neurophysiology technique. The originality of our research was to study in a same subject Event-Related-Potentials in three different conditions: passive and active auditory oddball paradigm for Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P 300, and a simple reaction time task with warming stimulus for the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV). The study was carried out among 20 schizophrenic subjects (paranoid subtype with acute exacerbation, DSM-III-R) and 20 healthy volunteers. Patients differed from controls as the following: a lower amplitude of N1-P2 components of the auditive evoked potentials, a lower amplitude of MMN (absent in 20% of the psychotic subjects), a lower amplitude and a longer latency of P300, and a lower amplitude of CNV. These results suggest a fundamental dysfunction of information processing which involves the early stages of automatic and voluntary attentional cognitive processes in schizophrenia.

TI  - The venous pump of the first metatarsophalangeal joint: Clinical implications
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: Although the anatomy and physiology of the venous circulation of the ankle and midfoot are well documented, the physiologic importance of forefoot mobility has not been reported in the literature. The question of this study was whether the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint may operate, like the ankle, as a "pump" to encourage venous return. Methods: Forty-nine cadaver foot specimens were examined using dissection, plastination, vessel infiltration, and maceration, and radiographic (including venography, MRI, and magnetic resonance angiography) techniques. The anatomy and physiology were described and compared to the ankle joint. Forty patients had biphasic Doppler How studies. Results: The major finding was the medial drainage of the plantar venous sinus, which is fibrotically bound to the joint capsule. Functional venous valves were evident distally and within fibrous vascular lumens. Mobilization of the first MTP joint led to compression and emptying of the veins. Passive mobilization of the first MTP joint led to an average flow increase of 55% +/- 7 (p < 0.0001), while active movement led to an average increase of 78% +/- 7 (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our described connection between the joint capsule and veins indicates a "toe-ankle pump" with a significant increase of venous blood flow during motion of the MTP joint. Possible clinical applications for an external MTP pump include anti-edema or thromboprophylactic therapy, especially in patients with foot or ankle injuries. A new toe-pump has been designed based on these results.

TI  - The vibro acoustic launch protection experiment overview and flight results summary
PY  - 2004
AB  - The cost of performing any mission on orbit is a strong function of the cost of getting the mass into orbit and the mass of a spacecraft is driven by the launch loads that the components must be deigned to survive. Additionally, these design loads vary between launch vehicles so if circumstances arise that require a change in launch vehicle significant time and money can be spent in modifying and testing to meet different requirements. Technologies that reduce both the vibration and acoustic environments during launch have the potential to both reduce the design load levels, and eventually equalize them between boosters. To this end the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate in cooperation with the Space Test Program, Boeing SVS, CSA Engineering, and Delta Velocity have been investigating methods to decrease the acoustic and vibration loads induced on payloads by the launch environment and demonstrating them on a sounding rocket launch. The Vibro-Acoustic Launch Protection Experiment (VALPE) mission included an acoustically designed Chamber-Core skin, two passive/active vibration isolation experiments, a passive/active acoustic damping experiment, and an energy recovery experiment integrated onto a Terrier-Improved Orion sounding rocket and launched from NASA Wallops Island. A description of the overall mission, experiments, and general results from the flight test are discussed.

TI  - The visual and driving performance of monocular and binocular heavy-duty truck drivers
PY  - 1991
AB  - This study compared the performance of 40 monocular and 40 binocular tractor-trailer drivers on measures of both visual and driving performance. On the visual measures, the mononuclear drivers were significantly deficient in contrast sensitivity, visual acuity under low illumination and glare, and binocular depth perception. They were not significantly deficient in static or dynamic visual acuity, visual field of individual eyes, or glare recovery. Driving measures of visual search, lane keeping, clearance judgment, gap judgment, hazard detection, and information recognition showed no differences between monocular and binocular drivers. Monocular drives were poorer than binocular drivers only in sign reading distance in both daytime and nighttime driving. This decrement correlated significantly with the binocular depth perception measure. There were large individual differences within each group for most of the visual and driving performance measures. It was concluded that monocular drivers have some significant reductions in selected visual capabilities and in certain driving functions dependent on these abilities, compared with binocular drivers. However, monocular drivers are not significantly worse than binocular drivers in the safety of most day-to-day driving functions. Implications of these findings and the large individual differences within each group are discussed. © 1991.

TI  - The visual nonverbal memory trace is fragile when actively maintained, but endures passively for tens of seconds
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite attempts at active maintenance in the focus of attention, the fragile nature of the visual nonverbal memory trace may be revealed when the retention interval between target memoranda and probed recall on a trial is extended. In contrast, a passively maintained or unattended visual memory trace may be revealed as persisting proactive interference extending across quite extended intervals between trials in a recent probes task. The present study, comprising five experiments, used this task to explore the persistence of such a passive visual memory trace over time. Participants viewed some target visual items (for example, abstract colored patterns) followed by a variable retention interval and a probe item. The task was to report whether the probe matched one of the targets or not. A decaying active memory trace was indicated by poorer performance as the memory retention interval was extended on a trial. However, when the probe was a member of the target set from the preceding trial, task performance was poorer than a comparison novel probe, demonstrating proactive interference. Manipulations of the intertrial interval revealed that the temporal persistence of the passive memory trace of an old target was impressive, and proactive interference was largely resilient to a simple ‘cued forgetting’ manipulation. These data support the proposed two-process memory conception (active–passive memory) contrasting fragile active memory traces decaying over a few seconds with robust passive traces extending to tens of seconds. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - The wheelchair as a full-body tool extending the peripersonal space
PY  - 2015
AB  - Dedicated multisensory mechanisms in the brain represent peripersonal space (PPS), a limited portion of space immediately surrounding the body. Previous studies have illustrated the malleability of PPS representation through hand-object interaction, showing that tool use extends the limits of the hand-centered PPS. In the present study we investigated the effects of a special tool, the wheelchair, in extending the action possibilities of the whole body. We used a behavioral measure to quantify the extension of the PPS around the body before and after Active (Experiment 1) and Passive (Experiment 2) training with a wheelchair and when participants were blindfolded (Experiment 3). Results suggest that a wheelchair-mediated passive exploration of far space extended PPS representation. This effect was specifically related to the possibility of receiving information from the environment through vision, since no extension effect was found when participants were blindfolded. Surprisingly, the active motor training did not induce any modification in PPS representation, probably because the wheelchair maneuver was demanding for non-expert users and thus they may have prioritized processing of information from close to the wheelchair rather than at far spatial locations. Our results suggest that plasticity in PPS representation after tool use seems not to strictly depend on active use of the tool itself, but is triggered by simultaneous processing of information from the body and the space where the body acts in the environment, which is more extended in the case of wheelchair use. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying body environment interaction for developing and improving applications of assistive technological devices in different clinical populations.

TI  - The wrist
PY  - 1982
AB  - The wrist is a condyloid joint, that is to say one that allows flexion, extension, abduction, adduction and circumduction, which is a combination of the previous four movements. The proximal face of the wrist joint comprises the distal end of the radius and the articular disc of the inferior radioulnar joint (which covers the head and the ulna and is attached to the ulnar styloid process). The distal face of the wrist joint comprises the proximal articular surfaces of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetral bones in the carpus. Consideration of wrist joint movement also requires consideration of adjacent joints. The radius and ulna articulate just proximal to the wrist joint at the inferior radio-ulnar joint. Distally, the bones of the carpus articulate such that the three proximal carpal bones that constitute the distal face of the wrist joint articulate at the mid-carpal joint with other carpal bones. Flexion and extension of the wrist joint may thus be increased by associated sliding movements of the intercarpal joints, making the range of flexion appear greater than that of extension, though at the wrist joint alone flexion is actually less than extension. Because of the greater distal projection of the radial styloid, the range of abduction at the wrist is considerably less than the range of adduction. There have been only a small number of previous studies on the range of movement at the wrist joint. In the analysis of range of movement at joints certain physical and epidemiological features apply and the wrist joint is no exception. 1. Movement may occur at more than one joint. This is particularly relevant to the carpus, which moves in flexion/extension with the wrist. For the purposes of this study supination/pronation was classified as elbow movement and will not be considered further in this chapter. 2. There is divergence in the literature on the relative range of movement in dominant and non-dominant hands. Allander et al (1974) found movement at the wrist to be reduced on the dominant side, perhaps because of increased muscle tone. However, for studies at the finger joint the relationship appears to vary according to the population under study. 3. A wider range of movement may be found in female joints and this may be related both to pregnancy and the stage of the menstrual cycle at which measurements are taken. 4. The differences between active and passive movement cause a big problem. The passive range is always larger than the active range, even when the active range of movement has been deliberately enhanced by active training. If passive movement is to be measured, a strict analysis would require the force to which the joint is subjected to achieve this range of movement to be accurately quantified for each arc of movement studied. For the purposes of this study passive movement was recorded in addition to active movement, even though this is to a large extent determined by observer enthusiasm. The joint was moved to a limit just short of the threshold of pain and the movement recorded immediately; it was not subsequently corrected for the stretching effect that allows further excursion of movement after the joint has been held at the extremity of its range for a few seconds. In practice, the difference between active and passive range of movement is less of a problem at the wrist (where range is largely determined by the shape of bony prominences) than it is at ball-and-socket joints such as the hip (where range of movement is largely determined by muscle tone). ).

TI  - Then enhancement of periosteal chondrogenesis in organ culture by dynamic fluid pressure
PY  - 2001
AB  - Cartilage repair by autologous periosteal arthroplasty is enhanced by continuous passive motion (CPM) of the joint after transplantation of the periosteal graft. However, the mechanisms by which CPM stimulate chondrogenesis are unknown. Based on the observation that an oscillating intra-synovial pressure fluctuation has been reported to occur during CPM (0.6-10 kPa), it was hypothesized that the oscillating pressure experienced by the periosteal graft as a result of CPM has a beneficial effect on the chondrogenic response of the graft. We have developed an in vitro model with which dynamic fluid pressures (DFP) that mimic those during CPM can be applied to periosteal explants while they are cultured in agarose gel suspension. In this study periosteal explants were treated with or without DFP during suspension culture in agarose, which is conducive to chondrogenesis. Different DFP application times (30 min, 4 h, 24 h/day) and pressure magnitudes (13, 103 kPa or stepwise 13 to 54 to 103 kPa) were compared for their effects on periosteal chondrogenesis. Low levels of DFP (13 kPa at 0.3 Hz) significantly enhanced chondrogenesis over controls (34 +/- 7% vs 14 +/- 5%; P &lt; 0.05), while higher pressures (103 kPa at 0.3 Hz) completely inhibited chondrogenesis, as determined from the percentage of tissue that was determined to be cartilage by histomorphometry. Application of low levels of DFP to periosteal explants also resulted in significantly increased concentrations of Collagen Type II protein (43 +/- 8% vs 10 +/- 5%; P &lt; 0.05). New proteoglycan synthesis, as measured by 35S-sulphate uptake was increased by 30% in periosteal explants stimulated with DFP (350 +/- 50 DPM vs 250 +/- 75 DPM of 35S-sulphate uptake/microg total protein), when compared to controls though this difference was not statistically significant. The DFP effect at low levels was dose-dependant for time of application as well, with 4 h/day stimulation causing significantly higher chondrogenesis than just 30 min/day (34 +/- 7 vs 12 +/- 4% cartilage; P &lt; 0.05) and not significantly less than that obtained with 24 h/day of DFP (48 +/- 9% cartilage, P &gt; 0.05). These observations may partially explain the beneficial effect on cartilage repair by CPM. They also validate an in vitro model permitting studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of action of mechanical factors regulating chondrogenesis. The fact that these tissues were successfully cultured in a mechanical environment for six weeks makes it possible to study the actions of mechanical factors on the entire chondrogenic pathway, from induction to maturation. Finally, these data support the theoretical predictions regarding the role of hydrostatic compression in fracture healing.

TI  - Theoretical study on a cable-bracing inerter system for seismic mitigation
PY  - 2019
AB  - In this paper, cables are proposed to connect the inerter and main frame for translation-to-rotation conversion, i.e., the cable-bracing inerter system (CBIS), with a magnified mass and enhanced damping effect. This novel configuration has the benefits of deformation relaxation at the connecting joints, easy installation, and an adaptive layout for nonconsecutive-story deployment. Dynamic motion equations were established for a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model equipped with a CBIS. The influence of dimensionless parameters, such as inertance-mass ratio, stiffness ratio and additional damping ratio on vibration mitigation were studied in terms of displacement response and force output. A single objective and multiple objective optimal design method were developed for a CBIS-equipped structure based on a performance-oriented design framework. Finally, the mitigation effect was illustrated and verified by a numerical simulation in a time-domain. The results showed that a CBIS is an effective structural response mitigation device used to mitigate the response of structural systems under earthquake excitation. Using the proposed optimization method, CBIS parameters can be effectively designed to satisfy the target vibration control level.

TI  - Theory of dynamic acoustic radiation force experienced by solid cylinders
PY  - 2005
AB  - A body insonified by a sound field is known to experience a steady force that is called the acoustic radiation force. This force can also be dynamic or oscillatory, knowing that the intensity of the incident sound field changes over time (amplitude modulation). The present paper develops the theory of dynamic radiation force experienced by a solid cylinder immersed in an ideal fluid. Analytical solutions of the equations for the dynamic force are derived. The equations provide analytical radiation force dependencies on the acoustic field and medium parameters. The case of compressional and shear waves' absorption in the solid material of the cylinder is also discussed. It is shown here that radiation force is no longer static and cannot be treated as a steady-state phenomenon.

TI  - Therapeutic activity of oral glucosamine sulfate in osteoarthrosis: A placebo-controlled double-blind investigation
PY  - 1980
AB  - Eighty inpatients with established osteoarthrosis received either 1.5 gm of glucosamine sulfate or placebo daily, in three divided oral doses, for 30 days. Articular pain, joint tenderness and swelling, and restriction of active and passive movements were scored at one-week intervals, as were possible side reactions. Hematologic analysis, urine analysis, and occult blood in feces were recorded before and after treatment. Samples of articular cartilage from two patients of each group and from one healthy subject were submitted to scanning electron microscopy after the end of treatment. All symptoms decreased in both groups. The patients treated with glucosamine sulfate experienced a reduction in overall symptoms that was almost twice as large (73% vs. 41%) and twice as fast (time to reduce symptoms by 50%: 20 days vs. 36 days) as those who had placebo. The improvement of autonomous mobility was relatively less, compared to improvement in the other symptoms, for patients with placebo; with glucosamine sulfate, on the contrary, the improvement was as great and as fast as that of the other symptoms. Thus a direct action of glucosamine sulfate on the cartilage is hypothesized. This hypothesis is supported by the findings of electron microscopy. The patients who had placebo showed a typical picture of established osteoarthrosis. Those who had glucosamine sulfate showed a picture more similar to healthy cartilage. It is concluded that glucosamine sulfate tends to rebuild the damaged cartilage, thus restoring articular function in most chronic arthrosic patients.

TI  - Therapeutic physical activity for people with vestibular impairments
PY  - 2015
AB  - Vestibular function is necessary to engage in activities of daily living such as walking and running, and is often unrecognized as a contributor to our balance system until the system is impaired due to disease or the aging process. This impairment to our vestibular system can result in debilitating symptoms and clinical signs of gaze and postural instability. An individualized exercise program, known as vestibular and balance rehabilitation therapy (VBRT) alleviates symptoms and facilitates the compensation process to improve impaired gaze stability, postural instability, and gait after vestibular deficits. Exercises range from static to dynamic movements, focusing on the central mechanisms to promote compensation and recovery from loss of function: adaptation, habituation, and sensory substitution. Sufficient evidence supports the use of VBRT as a therapeutic physical activity approach for people with vestibular impairments.

TI  - Therapeutic value of continuous passive motion after anterior cruciate replacement.
PY  - 1997
AB  - The aim of this study is the evaluation of the therapeutic value of continuous passive motion after ACL replacement. After 41 ACL reconstruction in 13 cases only active motion, in 28 cases active motion and CPM were used postoperatively. Stability, the range of motion and complications were evaluated at the time of discharge, 3 and 6 months after the operation. The flexion-extension in the CPM group was significantly greater at the time of discharge, but this difference was practically eliminated in 6 months after the operation. There were not any other significant difference between the two groups. The CPM gives only a little advantage in the rehabilitation after the ACL replacement.

TI  - There's something about passive movement...
PY  - 2010
AB  - The recognised (funded) stand-alone clinical status for therapeutic methods of passive movement has become increasingly threatened in recent times as the preference for active treatment (specific exercise) gains hold. This is in part due to the equivocal results for clinical trials of passive movement, queries regarding its cost-benefit and negative findings for many of the fundamental claims and recommendations of its clinical process. Linked to these issues has been the profession's difficulty in demonstrating plausible science-based mechanisms for anything more than transient effects. The present proposal is that the manual application of graduated oscillatory tensile loading to healing (or unhealed) soft tissues in the form of passive movement could facilitate optimal repair and tissue integrity (and so protection against subsequent 'stress'). The mechanism depends on the intrinsic ability for non-excitable connective tissue cells to 'sense' mechanical stimuli and to transduce mechanical into chemical signals. This leads to gene transcription and subsequent adaptive remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). An outline of these events is given, emphasising their dependence on the effective interplay between internally (cellular) and externally (matrix) generated mechanical forces. In principle, it ought to be possible to investigate the proposal and other clinical passive movement issues using modern soft tissue imaging and biological techniques with suitable human subjects and animal models.

TI  - Thermal Activation
PY  - 1975
AB  - While Chapter 3 dealt with the motion of dislocations at stresses above the peaks of the glide resistance, we shall here be concerned with the thermal release of dislocations from regions in which the stress is below some of the peaks of the glide resistance. Each dislocation is supposed to start at rest in a position of static equilibrium (the problem of superposition of the dynamic motion between the obstacles and the thermal release at the obstacles having been treated on a formal basis in Chapter 3). Thermal activation is a statistical process. It is never possible to say at which time a particular dislocation segment may be released. In this sense, we will always be dealing with averages. The fraction of a large number of identically situated dislocation segments that is released per unit time has been introduced in eq. [33e] as Pt. The ensuing macroscopic strain rate contains, in addition, the total number of dislocation segments taking part in the process and the average strain achieved with each activation event; these have been lumped together (eqs. [33d] and [33ii]) into a term yo that, in this Chapter, is treated as a phenomenological parameter that may depend weakly on stress (and possibly on temperature through the shear modulus). In principle, thermal activation events may occur in the "reverse" (<--) as well as in the "forward" (--~) direction. The net rate of strain is then given by the difference : --YoPt

TI  - Thermal and nociceptive sensations from menthol and their suppression by dynamic contact
PY  - 2007
AB  - It was recently found that cooling the skin to temperatures as mild as 25-30 degrees C can induce nociceptive sensations (burning, stinging or pricking) that are strongly suppressed by dynamic contact between the thermode and skin (contact suppression). Here we investigated whether nociceptive sensations produced by menthol can be similarly suppressed. In the first experiment subjects rated the intensity of cold and burning/stinging/pricking sensations before and after application of 10% l-menthol to the forearm. Ratings were compared at resting skin temperature (approximate to 33 degrees C) and at 28, 24, or 20 degrees C during static or dynamic contact cooling via a Peltier thermode. At resting skin temperature, menthol produced cold and nociceptive sensations, both of which were suppressed by dynamic contact. When the skin was cooled during static contact, menthol increased nociceptive sensations but not cold sensations; when the skin was cooled during dynamic contact, cold sensations were again unchanged while nociceptive sensations were suppressed. A second experiment tested whether contact suppression of menthol's cold and nociceptive sensations at resting skin temperature was caused by slight deviations of thermode temperature above skin temperature. The results showed that suppression occurred even when the thermode was slightly cooler (-0.5 degrees C) than the skin. These findings support other evidence that the menthol-sensitive channel, TRPM8, plays a role in cold nociception, and raise new questions about how dynamic tactile stimulation may modify perception of nonpainful cold stimulation.

PY  - 1996
AB  - The vibration of symmetric cross-ply plates under unsteady temperature effects and an unsteady moisture environment is studied for a simply supported heterogeneous anisotropic plate. When a temperature gradient exists through the plate thickness, a quasi-static deflection is present whose magnitude increases when a moisture gradient exists. As the moisture diffusion is extremely slow, the deflection due to the moisture is constant over long periods of time and hence the moisture does not affect the dynamic motion. (AIAA)

TI  - Thermoacoustic response of heat exchanger tubes in future aero-propulsion engines
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cylindrical heat exchanger tubes can act as active or passive acoustic elements that influence the thermoacoustic stability of combustion systems. They can act as both unsteady heat sinks and acoustic dampers. The present work is motivated by heat exchangers in future aero-propulsion engines. One significant difference to heat exchanger tubes in domestic boiler systems is that rather than being tightly spaced, their spacing is likely to be of the same order as their diameter. The heat transfer behaviour can change depending on the tube spacing. The contributions of this work are twofold. Firstly, to build acoustic scattering models for heat sinks and simple area jump conditions, and secondly, to include them in 1D network models to study the influence of the spatial positioning of these models within the network. Preliminary results indicate that there is significant variation in the thermoacoustic behaviour if one were to consider an approximated model with a heat sink followed by an area jump, as compared to the one where an area jump is followed by a heat sink © Proceedings of the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2019.

TI  - Thermodynamic study of protein dynamic structure in the oxygen binding reaction of myoglobin
PY  - 1990
AB  - We examined the flash photolysis of oxy complexes of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) on the nanosecond time scale at ambient temperatures. In this time range, we can observe the germinate reaction of Mb with the O2 ligand existing in the protein matrix after the photodissociation from the heme iron. We found that the fraction of the geminate component to the total O2 photodissociation exhibited temperature dependences. The geminate fraction decreased with rising temperature, indicating that the protein fluctuation is enhanced at high temperature because of thermal agitation. However, the temperature-dependent behavior showed a break at 20°C. Concerning the geminate O2 escaping reaction from the protein matrix to the solvent region, the activation energy above 20°C (0.4 ± 0.4 kcal/mol) is significantly lower than that below 20°C (5.1 ± 0.4 kcal/mol). Thermodynamic analysis on the basis of the transition state theory indicated that the O2 escaping reaction above 20°C is entropy dominated whereas that below 20°C is enthalpy dominated. The results were qualitatively compatible with the theoretical prediction by J. Kottalam and D.A. Case ((1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 7690-7697). Comparing the kinetic and thermodynamic process of the O2 geminate reaction among several Mbs, we concluded that the geminate O2 reaction with Mb is governed by the dynamic motion of the protein which is sensitively controlled by the static interaction of the heme moiety with the surroundings.

TI  - Theta oscillations accompanying concurrent auditory stream segregation
PY  - 2016
AB  - The ability to isolate a single sound source among concurrent sources is crucial for veridical auditory perception. The present study investigated the event-related oscillations evoked by complex tones, which could be perceived as a single sound and tonal complexes with cues promoting the perception of two concurrent sounds by inharmonicity, onset asynchrony, and/or perceived source location difference of the components tones. In separate task conditions, participants performed a visual change detection task (visual control), watched a silent movie (passive listening) or reported for each tone whether they perceived one or two concurrent sounds (active listening). In two time windows, the amplitude of theta oscillation was modulated by the presence vs. absence of the cues: 60-350 ms/6-8 Hz (early) and 350-450 ms/4-8 Hz (late). The early response appeared both in the passive and the active listening conditions; it did not closely match the task performance; and it had a fronto-central scalp distribution. The late response was only elicited in the active listening condition; it closely matched the task performance; and it had a centro-parietal scalp distribution. The neural processes reflected by these responses are probably involved in the processing of concurrent sound segregation cues, in sound categorization, and response preparation and monitoring. The current results are compatible with the notion that theta oscillations mediate some of the processes involved in concurrent sound segregation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Theta-Band Dysfunction as a Unifying Theme Across Sensory and Cognitive Modalities in Schizophrenia
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in sensory and cognitive function that represent a core feature of the disorder. In the auditory system, deficits in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation are among the best established biomarkers, and are linked to impaired role function in both prodromal and established Sz. Recently, we have demonstrated the underlying neural signature of MMN deficits, permitting assessment in translational rodent models. In the visual system, deficits in early potentials such as visual P1 component have been extensively replicated and correlate with subsequent attention-dependent cognitive impairments. Both auditory and visual deficits map extensively to impaired theta-band oscillatory activity, consistent with generalized theta-band impairment in Sz, reflecting local I/E dysregulation. This presentation focuses on translation and backtranslation of these findings across human and rodent models. Methods: Findings will be presented from rodent and human datasets. In rodents, auditory MMN was obtained during chronic treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) with or without concurrent treatment with the NMDAR co-agonist glycine. Neurophysiological activity was analyzed using timefrequency approaches to isolate underlying neurooscillatory activity, and response profiles were observed to those recently obtained in humans with a convergent paradigm. In humans, visual ERP were obtained during both passive visual stimulation and a feature-attention/ conjunction task, permitting parallel assessment of low (theta/delta) and high (gamma) frequency activity, and their relative contributions to cognitive performance. Results: In rodents, auditory MMN mapped primarily to the theta-frequency band, consistent with recent findings in humans. Chronic treatment with PCP (15 mg/kg/d) led to significant impairment in duration MMN generation and associated theta band activity. Concurrent glycine treatment (16% by weight) significantly prevented these deficits, supporting a critical role for NMDAR in modulation of theta-band dysfunction in Sz. In the human visual system, passively presented stimuli elicit an initial P1 response that (like auditory MMN) maps primarily to the theta-frequency range. Stimulus-driven theta activity is impaired specifically to magnocellular biased stimuli. Stimuli presented during an active visual (feature detection) task elicit both attentionindependent early theta and later, attention-dependent gamma activity. Path analysis suggests significant modulation of gamma activity by early theta, and significant modulation of task activity by late gamma, suggesting hierarchical contributions to cognitive impairments in Sz. Conclusions: This presentation supports theta oscillatory deficits as key contributors to impaired cortical information processing in Sz across sensory modalities. The rodent findings demonstrate links to underlying NMDAR dysfunction and support SOM-interneuron contributions to impaired E/I interaction in Sz. Visual findings suggest impaired oscillatory hierarchical theta/gamma coupling within sensory and cognitive brain regions, consistent with impaired SOM/ PV interactions across cortical regions.

TI  - Thiamine Transport Across the Rat Intestine: I. Normal characteristics
PY  - 1975
AB  - The characteristics of normal thiamine transport across the intestine were studied in rats using intact intestinal loops and everted jejunal segments. In vivo studies with [35S]-thiamine hydrochloride revealed, in all segments of small intestine, saturation kinetics for low thiamine concentrations (0.06 to 1.5 μM), but a linear relationship between high concentrations (2 to 560 μM) and absorption. Moreover, in vitro studies of net transmural flux using everted jejunal sacs demonstrated movement of [14C]-thiamine hydrochloride against a concentration gradient only when low, but not when high, thiamine concentration was used, so that the serosal to mucosal ratio became significantly greater than the initial value of one. Pyrithiamine, 2 μM, dinitrophenol, 200 μM, norethylmaleimide, 100 μM, and ouabain, 100 μM, reduced the net transmural flux of 0.2 μM thiamine. In contrast, these inhibitors had no effect on 20 μM thiamine. When unidirectional flux across the jejunum was measured, saturation kinetics was again demonstrated for low thiamine concentrations. This phenomenon, however, was abolished by the addition of pyrithiamine, which exerted competitive inhibition on thiamine absorption. Anoxia and sodium lack reduced intestinal uptake of 0.5 μM thiamine to 58% and 74% of normal, respectively, but did not affect uptake of 50 μM thiamine. Lowering the temperature led to a fall in thiamine uptake, the reduction being more marked with low thiamine concentrations (Q10, 1.648) than with high concentration (Q10, 1.127). Stirring of the water layer reduced Km to 59% of unstirred value, while the Vmax and permeability coefficient remained unchanged. Finally, movement of low concentration thiamine against an electrical gradient was observed under conditions of electrical short circuiting and zero potential difference. In contrast, no such effect was seen with high concentrations. These studies suggest that there exists in the rat a dual system of intestinal thiamine transport.

TI  - Thin Cable Fiber-Optic Hydrophone Array for Passive Acoustic Surveillance Applications
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fiber-optic interferometric sensing is a very attractive approach for creating lightweight, high-sensitive, and fully passive fiber-optic hydrophone arrays. In this paper, results of sea trials of the thin cable fiber-optic hydrophone array for passive acoustic surveillance applications are presented. The performed trials consisted of two parts: the first part was devoted to the estimation of the array acoustic performance and the second part included the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of the moving acoustic source. The estimation of the array acoustic performance showed that the average measured pressure sensitivity of fiber-optic hydrophones increased as the acoustic frequency increased from -122 dB re rad/mu Pa at 20 Hz to -116 dB re rad/mu Pa at 495 Hz. The average minimum detectable pressure of hydrophones decreased from 78, 1 dB re 1 mu Pa at 20 Hz to 28, 5 dB re 1 mu Pa at 495 Hz. Obtained values of the minimum detectable pressure were below the sea state zero noise level in the considered frequency range. The average dynamic range of fiber-optic hydrophones was above 120 dB at 495 Hz. The proper capability of the DOA estimation was successfully demonstrated using the motor boat as the moving acoustic source. Trajectories of the moving boat were obtained by using the beamscan DOA estimation algorithm with additional Kalman filtering. Obtained results demonstrated the great potential of using fiber-optic interferometric sensors for hydroacoustic surveillance applications. The presented results might be helpful for the implementation of extended fiber-optic hydroacoustic surveillance systems.

TI  - This Logo Moves Me: Dynamic Imagery from Static Images
PY  - 2014
AB  - The authors propose that static visuals can evoke a perception of movement (i.e., dynamic imagery) and thereby affect consumer engagement and attitudes. Focusing on brand logos as the static visual element, the authors measure the perceived movement evoked by the logo and demonstrate that the evoked dynamic imagery affects the level of consumer engagement with the brand logo. They measure consumer engagement through both self-report measures and eye-tracking technology and find that engagement affects consumer attitudes toward the brand. The authors also show that the perceived movement engagement attitude effect is moderated by the congruence between perceived movement and brand characteristics. These findings suggest that dynamic imagery is an important aspect of logo design, and if used carefully, it can enhance brand attitudes.

TI  - This Rock 'n' Roll Video Teaches Math
PY  - 2009
AB  - Mathematics is a discipline that has significantly advanced through the use of digital technologies with improved computational, graphical, and symbolic capabilities. Digital videos can be used to present challenging mathematical questions for students. Video clips offer instructional possibilities for moving students from a passive mode of watching to active exploration of mathematical ideas. Video clips (short excerpts from movies, television shows, professionally prepared educational videos, or personally created videos) can be used to introduce new mathematical concepts and processes; explore mathematics in nature, art, or other contexts in the real world; and engage students in expressing their mathematical understandings as they think about what has been said or displayed. YouTube is a rich source for video clips and short movies that will challenge students to watch carefully and engage in mathematical thinking. Analysis is at the heart of reasoning in mathematics. Students need experiences that guide them as they learn to reason mathematically. They need opportunities to make conjectures based on their analyses and to communicate the thinking that directs them toward these conjectures. Engaging students in analysis of events in video clips is one way of providing these important experiences. Integrating digital videos with other media, such as Geometer's Sketchpad, spreadsheets, calculators, and virtual manipulatives, affords students many opportunities to create, use, and make sense of multiple representations of mathematical ideas. Technology is essential in teaching and learning mathematics; it influences the mathematics that is taught and enhances students' learning. In this article, the authors describe how digital videos can both enhance students' learning of mathematics and engage students in mathematical thinking. (Contains 3 online resources.)

PY  - 2015
AB  - This article presents an overview of two articles in the October issue of The Journal of Neuroscience . The first article discuses about the loss of a scaffold protein which leads to excessive GTPase activity. The strength of glutamatergic synapses is determined largely by the number of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic density and the size and shape of dendritic spines. These characteristics are regulated partly by the small GTPases Ras, Rap1, and Rap2. The importance of scaffolding proteins in synaptic function is illustrated, who studied the forebrain-enriched protein PSD-Zip70. Previous studies showed that PSD-Zip70 binds SPAR, a Rap GAP enriched in spines. The second article investigated whether passive movements that replicate the kinematics produced during active movement are able to refine motor skill. The results clearly indicate that learning what a desired action feels like has an essential role in the early stages of motor learning. An important question for future studies is whether passive training exclusively with accurate trajectories can speed or enhance the acquisition of precise motor skills.

TI  - Thixotropic changes in human muscle stiffness and the effects of fatigue [published erratum appears in Q J Exp Physiol 1988 Sep;73(5):following 808]
PY  - 1988
AB  - Two methods have been used to study the stiffness of the relaxed finger musculature after movement followed by various times at rest. The muscles stiffen considerably as the time at rest increases. The time course of this change has been plotted; it continues at a declining rate for at least 30 min. The increased stiffness after resting can be immediately reduced by active or passive movements but not by isometric efforts. These changes characterize a thixotropic system and suggest a long-term molecular rearrangement in relaxed muscle. Extensive eccentric exercise of the muscles under investigation reduces the overall stiffness and there is a concomitant increase in tremor on movement.

TI  - Thompson's quadricepsplasty for stiff knee.
PY  - 2007
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiffness of the knee after trauma and/or surgery for femoral fractures is one of the most common complications and is difficult to treat. Stiffness in extension is more common and can be reduced by vigorous physiotherapy. If it does not improve then quadricepsplasty is indicated. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the results of Thompsons quadricepsplasty.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two male patients (age range 20-45 years) with posttraumatic knee stiffness following distal femoral fractures underwent Thompson's quadricepsplasty where knee flexion range was less than 45°. The index injury in these patients was treated with plaster cast (n=5), plates (n=3), intramedullary nailing (n=3) and external fixator for open fractures (n=9). Thompson's quadricepsplasty was performed in all the patients using anterior approach, with incision extending from the upper thigh to the tibial tubercle. Release of rectus femoris from underlying vastus intermedius and release of intraarticular adhesions were performed. After surgery the patients needed parenteral analgesia for three days and then oral analgesics for three weeks. Active assisted knee mobilization exercises was started on the first postoperative day. Continuous passive motion machine was used from the same day. Supervised physiotherapy was continued in hospital for six weeks followed by intensive knee flexion and extension exercise including cycling at home for atleast another six months.RESULTS: Out of 22 patients, 20 had excellent to good results and two patients had poor results using criteria devised by Judet. One poor result was due to peroperative fracture of patella which was then internally fixed and hence the flexion of knee could not be started immediately. There was peroperative avulsion of tibial tuberosity in another patient who finally gained less than 50° knee flexion and hence a poor result.CONCLUSION: Thompsons quadricepsplasty followed by a strict and rigourous postoperative physiotherapy protocol successfully increases the range of knee flexion.

TI  - Thoracic intersegmental interneurones in the locust with mechanoreceptive inputs from a leg
PY  - 1986
AB  - 1. In the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust, Schistocerca gregaria, are a discrete population of intersegmental interneurones which receive inputs from one middle leg and project to the metathoracic ganglion controlling the hind legs. 2. Their small somata (15-25 μm) are lateral to a posterior connective. They arborize ipsilaterally and send an axon to the metathoracic ganglion where they also branch ipsilaterally. 3. These interneurones show specific responses to inputs from joint receptors or exteroreceptors of one mesothoracic leg. One interneurone responds to inputs from both middle legs but none respond to pro- or metathoracic receptors. None are sensitive to visual and auditory stimuli. 4. Several interneurones respond to proprioceptive inputs from one joint. Some for example, are excited phasically or phasotonically by imposed and voluntary movements of the tibia, with a directional sensitivity. Some are sensitive to both passive and active movements of the tarsal segments only, while others are excited by inputs from proprioceptors of both femoro-tibial and tibio-tarsal joints. One is excited by movements of the tarsus, and inhibited by a voluntary flexion of the tibia. 5. Within the same population are interneurones excited by the stimulation of external mechanoreceptors on the tibia. 6. The function of these interneurones is most easily explained in the context of interlimb coordination during locomotion. Their behavioural significance is emphasised by the fact that they are also active during voluntary movement. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Three Dimensional Kinematics of the Thoracolumbar Spine as Quantified by a Novel In Vivo/In Vitro Active/Passive Robotic Simulator
PY  - 2011
AB  - Low back pain is one of the leading causes of missed work. Surgical intervention is an option to those who have failed conservative therapy. The current gold standard of surgical procedures is bony fusion. Long term follow up of fusion patients has identified adjacent level disease as a complication. New motion preserving technologies aim to eliminate harmful effects on adjacent levels but have not been confirmed with long term clinical trials. In vitro testing provides repeatability for relative comparison between treatments, but the clinical relevance remains questionable without in vivo loads and motions. We have developed a novel in vivo/in vitro method using active motion to characterize the motion of the thoracolumbar spine using a robotic simulator. Preliminary results indicate a reduction in motion at the operative and super-adjacent level while motion is increased at all other levels. This may be compensation for the reduced motions at the operative and adjacent level.

AB  - DEVELOPING your listening skills can enhance your relationships with colleagues and clients. By listening attentively you can show that you value someone's opinion and it helps to build a more harmonious working environment. There are several ways to show that you are listening to someone: Listening can be either passive or active. Each is useful, but you need to work out which process will work best for you depending on he circumstance. Active listening involves you listening, questioning and summarising. Passive listening involves you listening quietly but with some appropriate non-verbal or verbal encouragement. Often, the best method of listening involves passive listening interspersed with some summary and reflection, and some appropriate questions. So long as you make the person talking feel that you have taken on board their comments and listened and absorbed their points of view, they will feel valued. Next time you have in a conversation with someone, see if you can switch off all the distractions that might be going on around you. You could also ask someone you trust for feedback on your listening capabilities.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Plant Shoots from Multiple Images using an Active Vision System.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The reconstruction of 3D models of plant shoots is a challenging problem central to the emerging discipline of plant phenomics-the quantitative measurement of plant structure and function. Current approaches are, however, often limited by the use of static cameras. We propose an automated active phenotyping cell to reconstruct plant shoots from multiple images using a turntable capable of rotating 360 degrees and camera mounted robot arm. To overcome the problem of static camera positions we develop an algorithm capable of analysing the environment and determining viewpoints from which to capture initial images suitable for use by a structure from motion technique. I. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION The global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and the spread of prosperity throughout the world is increasing the food intake per capita, driving the demand for a richer, more varied diet. At the same time, changes in climate are causing more frequent and severe flooding, destroying crop yields and shortage of arable land constitutes an additional challenge. It has been widely predicted that without crop climate adaption the production of food will deteriorate [1], [2]. The long-term goal of this work is to provide the innovative approach to sustainable agriculture necessary to adapt to the fluctuating environment and increased demand for food. The identification of more productive and/or resilient crop species requires connections to be made between the genetic and physical structures of the plant. While significant progress has been made in the study of the genome in recent years, the creation and quantitative analysis of plant phenotypes (structures) has become a major bottleneck. Though some plant traits (e.g. leaf area) can be estimated using a single carefully placed camera and 2D image analysis methods, the ability to produce accurate 3D models of plants would support a wide variety of phenotyping tasks. Image-based reconstruction methods are attractive in this context. Plants are easily disturbed; non-invasive sensing techniques capable of capturing information across the whole object are required. Plant shoots are, however, a challenging target for image-based reconstruction. Individual variation within species is often large, making it difficult to predict structures a priori. Individual leaves can be very similar in appearance, and densely-packed, occluding each other from many viewpoints: plants can be very crowded scenes. The leaves of many species are quite highly reflective, and often lack the strong texture needed by some techniques. The starting point for the work described here is the hypothesis that active vision can aid in the generation of high-quality plant models by providing improved, and responsive, image acquisition strategies. Active vision systems automatically control and manipulate camera viewpoints to provide images which best support the task at hand. Active methods have played a role in other plant-related tasks. For example, [3] attach a camera to a robot arm in order to identify peppers to be collected. The effect of camera placement on fruit picking has been investigated [4], and active vision used to address the problem of occlusion. The large-scale phenotyping systems now finding application in plant and crop science, however, typically rely on fixed viewpoints that are not adapted to the specific plant being modelled. Some systems rotate the plant during imaging, but still use static camera positions. This means that, in many cases, the images captured are far from optimal, adversely affecting the results obtained. The ability to adjust sensors in response to emerging plant properties (e.g. size) is vital if accurate representations are to be obtained of a wide variety of plant species, ages and conditions. We aim to produce a fully automated, active system that is capable of manipulating a camera's viewpoint to produce high quality 3D models of a wide range of plants by adapting to the visual information available, without user interaction, with the longer-term goal of improved plant phenotyping. The approach proposed here offers more flexibility than existing large scale phenotyping systems by adapting to the natural variation of individual plants in order to obtain optimal data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows; we first introduce the reader to 3D plant reconstruction, discussing current approaches and the challenges they face. We then provide a concise overview of active vision and the various components that are necessary, before discussing the approach used in this work. Results obtained from real and artificial plants are presented. Finally, we conclude with a summary of progress and plans for future work. II. 3D PLANT RECONSTRUCTION Until the late 1960s botanical drawings were the primary means of capturing plant architecture. Today a variety of approaches are available. Rule-based methods use a set of rules to define the structure of a particular species or class of plant. Varying the parameters of these systems produces models of single plants, but rule-based approaches cannot easily be used to produce the descriptions of specific, existing plants needed to support phenotyping. Image based approaches seek plant geometry directly, analysing a set of images to reconstruct representations of actual plants. Image based models can be used to support simulations and enable the extraction of trait measurements. Some approaches, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) [5], custom illuminate the target object by emitting

TI  - Three-Dimensional Visualization Simulation of Chinese Fir Stand Growth Based on Unity3D
PY  - 2018
AB  - In view of the problems existing in the 3D visualization simulation of stand growth, such as static discrete process, low visualization effect and limited expression of morphological parameters, this paper took the continuous survey data of 6 plots of Huangfengqiao State-owned forest farm in Hunan Province from 2012 to 2017 as data source. The stand age(A), Hegyi competition index(Hegyi-CI), and the tree's own diameter at breast height(DBH) were used as independent variables to establish the growth model of individual tree DBH. Then, according to the liner relationship models between DBH and free height(H), DBH and crown width(CW), and the relationship between H and height under living branch(UBH), the H, CW, and UBH were predicted. Finally, based on the dynamic dissection and organization of the Chinese Fir free three-dimesional(3D) model and Unity3D engine, continuous and dynamic visual simulation of stand growth was conducted. The results showed that the R-2 of DBH prediction model was as high as 0.995. The R-2 of the linear relationship models between DBH and H, DBH and CW, H and UBH was 0.831, 0.569 and 0.628. These provide good data support for the visual simulation of stand growth and ensure that the stand growth is in line with natural laws. The 3D visual simulation of stand growth based on the Unity3D engine is intuitive and fluent, and the frames per second(FPS) can be maintained at more than 50, which can basically meet the requirements of forestry scientific research and production practice.

TI  - Three-dimensional acromioclavicular joint motions during elevation of the arm
PY  - 2008
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study.OBJECTIVES: To determine the 3-dimensional motions occurring between the scapula relative to the clavicle at the acromioclavicular joint during humeral elevation in the scapular plane.BACKGROUND: Shoulder pathology is commonly treated through exercise programs aimed at correcting scapular motion abnormalities. However, little is known regarding how acromioclavicular joint motions contribute to normal and abnormal scapulothoracic motion.METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty subjects (16 males, 14 females) participated. Subjects with positive symptoms on clinical exam or past history of shoulder pathology, trauma, or surgery were excluded. Electromagnetic surface motion analysis was performed tracking the thorax, clavicle, scapula, and humerus. Subjects performed 3 repetitions of scapular plane abduction, Passive motion data were, also collected for scapular plane abduction, from cadaver specimens, Data were analyzed using within-session reliability and descriptive statistics as well as repeated-measures analyses of variance(ANOVAs) to determine the effect of elevation angle from rest to 90 degrees humeral elevation. Reliability was determined from repeated trials in the same session without removing sensors or redigitizing landmarks.RESULTS: Angular values were highly repeatable within session (ICC > 0.94; SEM, < 2.3 degrees). During active scapular plane abduction from rest to 90 degrees, average acromioclavicular joint angular values demonstrated increased internal rotation (approximately 4.3 degrees), increased upward rotation (approximately 14.6 degrees), and increased posterior tilting (approximately 6.7 degrees) (P <.05). Passive motions on cadavers demonstrated similar kinematic patterns.CONCLUSIONS: Significant motion occurs at the acrornioclavicular joint during active humeral elevation, contributing to scapular motion on the thorax. This information provides a foundation for understanding normal acromioclavicular joint motion as a basis for further investigation of pathology and rehabilitation approaches.

TI  - Three-dimensional axon morphologies of individual layer 5 neurons indicate cell type-specific intracortical pathways for whisker motion and touch
PY  - 2011
AB  - The cortical output layer 5 contains two excitatory cell types, slender-and thick-tufted neurons. In rat vibrissal cortex, slender-tufted neurons carry motion and phase information during active whisking, but remain inactive after passive whisker touch. In contrast, thick-tufted neurons reliably increase spiking preferably after passive touch. By reconstructing the 3D patterns of intracortical axon projections from individual slender-and thick-tufted neurons, filled in vivo with biocytin, we were able to identify cell type-specific intracortical circuits that may encode whisker motion and touch. Individual slender-tufted neurons showed elaborate and dense innervation of supragranular layers of large portions of the vibrissal area (total length, 86.8 +/- 5.5 mm). During active whisking, these long-range projections may modulate and phase-lock the membrane potential of dendrites in layers 2 and 3 to the whisking cycle. Thick-tufted neurons with soma locations intermingling with those of slender-tufted ones display less dense intracortical axon projections (total length, 31.6 +/- 14.3 mm) that are primarily confined to infragranular layers. Based on anatomical reconstructions and previous measurements of spiking, we put forward the hypothesis that thick-tufted neurons in rat vibrissal cortex receive input of whisker motion from slender-tufted neurons onto their apical tuft dendrites and input of whisker touch from thalamic neurons onto their basal dendrites. During tactile-driven behavior, such as object location, near-coincident input from these two pathways may result in increased spiking activity of thick-tufted neurons and thus enhanced signaling to their subcortical targets.

TI  - Three-dimensional in vivo scapular kinematics and scapulohumeral rhythm: a comparison between active and passive motion
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare the scapular kinematics and scapulohumeral rhythm of healthy participants during arm elevation and lowering and to find the difference between active motion and passive motion of the shoulder. Methods: The study examined the shoulders of 10 healthy men (mean age, 23.5 years; age range, 22-28 years). The shoulders of participants were elevated and lowered while fluoroscopic images were taken, and 3-dimensional bone models were created from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional images using model registration techniques. The Euler angle sequences of the models' scapular kinematics and scapulohumeral rhythm were compared during active and passive shoulder motion. Results: There was a significant statistical difference of upward rotation during arm elevation between active and passive shoulder movements (P =.027). In particular, the upward rotation between 45° and 90° of elevation showed a statistically significant difference (P <.001). When the scapula was tilted posteriorly by active motion, it resulted in a statistically significant difference as there was more tilting in the high-degree range of motions than when it was tilted by passive motion (P <.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in scapular external rotation. However, during arm lowering, scapular kinematics did not show statistically significant difference between active and passive motion. Conclusions: The scapular kinematics showed statistically significant differences between active and passive motion of upward rotation and posterior tilting of the scapula during arm elevation, but there were none during lowering. In terms of upward rotation, active shoulders rotated more upward during arm elevation. © 2019 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees

TI  - Three-dimensional mapping of the benthic invertebrates biophony with a compact four-hydrophones array
PY  - 2019
AB  - Benthic invertebrates emit broadband transient sounds, that dominate coastal soundscapes and can inform on the environment and its ecological state. Numerous works have studied temporal patterns of Benthic Invertebrate Biophonies (BIB) and linked them to environmental parameters or ecological processes, but there is a lack of knowledge about the spatial variability of BIB. Here, we mapped Benthic Invertebrate Sounds (BIS) in three dimensions using a compact array (2 m x 2 m x 2 m) of four hydrophones within the scope of eco-acoustics studies. Firstly, we developed tools to localize any individual sound emitted by benthic invertebrates. A theoretical calculation of the Cramer Rao Bounds (CRB) consolidated by in situ active emissions from known positions, demonstrated the accuracy of the localization. Secondly, by accumulating all the positions of the BIS recorded during a night, three methods are proposed to map the BIB at different spatial scales. An in situ measurement campaign carried out on a 300 m x 300 m artificial reef system revealed that the marine fauna was binary spatially distributed: rich and numerous on artificial reefs and poor and weak outside the reefs. At small ranges (10 m), the acoustic maps matched the geometric structures of the reefs with an accuracy of 0.5 m. At large scales (100 m and 300 m), the acoustic hot-spots on the maps corresponded to distant reefs, with an accuracy of 7 m and 10 m respectively.This study provides the first maps of the BIB at ecologically relevant scales and shows that they can be used to identify, quantify, follow and track benthic activity hot-spots. In combination with biological and ecological information, passive acoustic monitoring using such maps can be a powerful complementary tool for ecological studies, such as the quantification of grazing activity or the evaluation of the efficiency of marine ecologic restoration programs.

TI  - Three-dimensional passive acoustic tracking of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in ray-refracting environments
PY  - 2005
AB  - A wide-aperture towed passive acoustic array is used to obtain ranges and depths of acoustically active sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico in June 2004, by extending a technique previously reported [Thode, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116, 245-253 (2004)] to explicitly account for ray-refraction effects arising from a depth-dependent sound speed profile. Under this expanded approach, three quantities are measured from an impulsive sound: the time difference between direct-path arrivals on a forward and rear subarray, the time difference between the direct and surface-reflected paths on the rear subarray, and the acoustic bearing measured on the rear subarray. These quantities, combined with independent measurements of hydrophone depths and cable inclination, are converted into range-depth position fixes by implementing an efficient numerical procedure that uses a ray-tracing code to account for ray-refraction effects caused by depth-dependent sound speed profiles. Analytic expressions that assume a constant waterborne sound speed are also derived. Foraging depths of various sperm whales over 10 days in June, 2004 are estimated using the numerical technique.

TI  - Three-dimensional repositioning tasks show differences in joint position sense between active and passive shoulder motion
PY  - 2012
AB  - Proprioception is important in maintaining shoulder joint stability. Previous studies investigated the effects of unconstrained multiplanar motion, with subjects able to move freely in space, on repositioning tasks for active shoulder motion but not passive motion. We sought to further explore joint position sense with 3D passive, robot-guided motions. We hypothesized that target repositioning error would be greater in the case of passively placed targets than for actively placed targets. To investigate, 15 healthy individuals participated (8 female, 7 male), who were at most 6?ft (183?cm) tall to accommodate the equipment, and who had no history of shoulder injury, surgery, or significant participation in throwing sports. Target orientations were centered at 44 degrees of elevation and 32 degrees of horizontal rotation from the frontal plane. Two sets of 10 trials were performed. The first set involved active placement followed by active replacement, and the second set involved passive, robot-guided, placement followed by active replacement. Repositioning error was greater following passive placement than active placement (p?<?0.001). These results further our understanding of the differences between active and passive joint position sense at the shoulder. (c) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Three-dimensional scene reconstruction using digital holograms
PY  - 2005
AB  - One of the principal successes of computer vision over the past thirty years has been the development of robust techniques for the estimation of the structure of a 3D scene given multiple views of that scene. Since holograms permit reconstruction of arbitrary views of the scene they provide a novel avenue of extension to these traditional computer vision techniques. In traditional stereo or multi-view vision systems, the quality of the 3D reconstruction is dictated by the camera configuration. Hence, if a part of the scene is occluded to each view, then reconstruction of that part is impossible. Active vision systems aim to increase the accuracy of the final reconstruction by dynamically changing their camera configuration. However, this must be performed online and is only possible if the scene is static. This online requirement comes from the fact that the algorithms follow a closed-loop strategy. Therefore the optimal views are dependent on the particular scene being reconstructed. We capture digital holograms of 3D scenes using phase-shift digital interferometry. Holographic systems permit the synthesis of arbitrary views of the scene offline. These can still be considered as closed loop approaches where the loop is closed between the image reconstruction and the hologram (i.e. not the sensor). Since all views are captured simultaneously, arbitrary views can be reconstructed after the hologram is recorded. We have built an active vision system that uses a digital hologram of a scene. The system responds to requests for particular 3D information (such as views of particular portions of the scene from particular perspectives). It keeps track of previously reconstructed views, and determines when and where it needs further reconstruction information to satisfy subsequent requests. We believe this would be particularly useful in scenarios where exhaustive reconstruction of the scene or every perspective of a scene would not be possible, such as with near-real-time Internet-based digital hologram applications.

TI  - Three-dimensional vibration transmission through the upper limb when performing reaching movements in vehicle
PY  - 2013
AB  - Whole body vibration (WBV) transmission to vehicle occupants is a function of both vibration characteristics and human posture-movement. The majority of earlier studies investigating biomechanical responses to WBV have considered only a static posture. However, vibration transmission can be affected by dynamic movements when reaching in vehicle and may be transmitted in three-dimension (3D). This study investigates vibration transmission to the upper extremities with changes in posture-movement along the intended reach trajectory under selected sinusoidal WBV conditions. In biodynamic WBV experiments, 21 subjects performed a reaching task to targets located in the right hemisphere under vibration exposure. Intermediate targets were also placed in the expected trajectories of hand movements. 3D biodynamic responses are characterised as a function of upper body posture. This study establishes the empirical database necessary to support a biodynamic model taking into consideration human activity to predict reaching performance under WBV exposure.

TI  - Threshold control of arm posture and movement adaptation to load
PY  - 2006
AB  - We addressed the fundamental questions of which variables underlie the control of arm movement and how they are stored in motor memory, reproduced and modified in the process of adaptation to changing load conditions. Such variables are defined differently in two major theories of motor control (internal models and threshold control). To resolve the controversy, these theories were tested (experiment 1) based on their ability to explain why active movement away from a stable posture is not opposed by stabilizing mechanisms (the posture-movement problem). The internal model theory suggests that the system counteracts the opposing forces by increasing the muscle activity in proportion to the distance from the initial posture (position-dependent EMG control). In contrast, threshold control fully excludes these opposing forces by shifting muscle activation thresholds and thus resetting the stabilizing mechanisms to a new posture. Subjects were sitting, holding the vertical handle of a double-joint manipulandum with their right hand and were facing a computer screen on which the handle and target to be reached were displayed. In response to an auditory signal, subjects quickly moved the handle from an initial position to one of two (frontal and sagittal) targets. No load was applied during the movement but in separate trials, a brief perturbation was applied to the handle by torque motors controlling the manipulandum. Perturbations were applied prior to or 3 s after movement offset, in the latter case in one of eight directions. The EMG activity of the majority of the seven recorded muscles was at zero level before movement onset and returned to zero level after movement offset. Those muscles that remained active before or after the movement could be made silent whereas previously silent muscles could be activated after a small passive displacement (several millimeters) elicited by perturbations in appropriate directions. Results showed that the activation thresholds of motoneurons of arm muscles were reset from the initial to a final position and that EMG activity was not position-dependent. These results were inconsistent with the internal model theory but confirmed the threshold control theory. Then the ability of threshold control theory to explain rapid movement adaptation to a position-dependent load was investigated (experiment 2 and 3). Subjects produced fast movement to the frontal target with and without a position-dependent load applied to the handle. Trials were organized in blocks alternating between the load and no-load condition (20 blocks in total, with randomly chosen number of five to ten trials in each). Subjects were instructed "do not correct" in experiment 2 and "correct" movement errors during the trial in experiment 3. Five threshold arm configurations underlying the movement production and adaptation were identified. When instructed "do not correct", movement precision was fully restored on average after two trials. No significant improvement was observed as the experiment progressed despite the fact that the same load condition was repeated after one block of trials. Thus, in each block, the adaptation was made anew, implying that subjects relied on short-term memory and could not recall the threshold arm configurations they specified to accurately reach the same target in the same load condition in previous blocks. When instructed to "correct" within each trial, precision was restored faster, on average after one trial.Major aspects of the production and adaptation of arm movement (including the kinematics, moveent errors, instruction-dependent behavior, and absence of position-related EMG activity) are explained in terms of threshold control.

TI  - Threshold fluctuation comparison between Oculus Smartfield Spark strategy and Humphrey Sita Fast
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the thresholds fluctuation of the Oculus Smartfield perimeter using Spark strategy and the Humphrey Analyzer perimeter using SITA-Fast strategy. Methods: The Oculus Smartfield is a prototipe of a compact automated perimeter for static visual field examination which uses a LED's tangent screen for generating luminous stimuli and a wide diameter lens for near vision compensation. Spark strategy makes four consecutives threshold stimation and the result obtained is a average of them. The Humphrey Analyzer is a proyection commercial perimeter which uses the SITA strategy. We performed a prospective, observational clinical study to learn about threshold fluctuation differences between Smartfield and Humphrey perimeters. A hundred and five normal eyes and 138 suspect and confirmed glaucomas were examined twice with each system in random order. Fifty two both strategies matching points were analyzed: 30ox24o in Spark (66 points) and 24-2 in SITA-Fast (52 points). Results: Exam duration was: 2:57 minutes (sd=0:02) in Spark and 2:56 minutes (sd=0:46) in SITA-Fast (P=0.33). Fluctuation in the matching points were respectively: for thresholds between 20-35dB, 1.09dB (sd=1.16) and 1.36dB (sd=1.77) (p<0.0001) and between 0-20dB: 2.23dB (sd=2.51) and 3.76dB (sd=4.80) (P<0.0001). Bland-Altman diagram showed a similar distribution between both perimeters for small and wide desviations. Conclusions: Fluctuation was significantly lower in the averaged Smartfield-Spark strategy than in Humphrey SITA-Fast, mainly below 20 dB, which results inferior in more than 40%. This fact seems not to be related to both instruments and strategies dynamic range differences.

TI  - Thumb carpometacarpal arthroplasty using flexor carpi radialis
PY  - 1996
AB  - Ligament reconstruction-tendon interposition arthroplasty using flexor carpi radialis has become a popularprocedure in the surgical treatment of osteoarthrosis of the trapeziometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb. Principles of the surgical reconstruction include partial or complete trapeziectomy, stabilization of the metacarpal at the base of the thumb with a distally based strip of flexor carpi radialis tendon that discourages both dorsal subluxation and proximal migration of the thumb metacarpal, and interposition arthroplasty with the remaining flexor carpi radialis tendon packed into the trapezial fossa. Concurrent stabilization of the metacarpophalangeal joint is performed when there is greater than 30° of hypertension or valgus laxity. Carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's extensor tenosynovitis, and stenosing flexor tenosynovitis are specifically sought as coexistent conditions and are treated operatively at the time of basal joint arthroplasty. Postoperative immobilization for 1 month with Kirschner wire fixation of the thumb metacarpal is followed by a directed rehabilitation program of active and passive motion and progressive resistive strengthening exercises over a 3 to 6 month period. Pain relief has been uniformly excellent and, at greater than 10-year follow-up, grip strength has improved by an average of 100%, tip pinch strength by more than 50%, and key pinch strength by nearly 35% when compared with preoperative values. Radiographic evaluation demonstrates minimal deterioration of position on stress radiographs, with an average subluxation of 11% of the width of the metacarpal base and an average loss of 13% of the height of the arthroplasty space. This modest radiographic deterioration of the arthroplasty does not correlate with any loss of functional capacity.

TI  - Tibiofemoral joint loading during therapeutic exercises and activities of daily living: Implications for rehabilitation in osteoarthritis and cartilage repair surgery
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose: Promotion of active movement is an important part of an osteoarthritis (OA) prevention and treatment plan. Regular participation in daily live activities is known to potentially reduce symptoms, whereas a sedentary lifestyle is known toworsen symptoms. This might seem contradictory since loading plays a role in the development and progression of OA. Likewise, the postoperative mechanical conditions are known to play a role in the success of cartilage repair surgery. In this study we provide an overview of the loading imposed to the tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) and to the medial and lateral condyle during activities of daily living and therapeutic exercises in healthy adults. This knowledge is useful for deciding on the specific exercises to be included in a rehabilitation program. Methods: Three-dimensional marker trajectories were captured during gait, stair ascend (SU), stair descend (SD), squat (SQ), rise from a chair and seat again (STS) and a forward lunge (FL) for eleven healthy subjects using Vicon (Oxford Metrics, UK, 100Hz). Markers were placed according to an extended plug-in-gait markerset. Ground reaction forces were recorded simultaneously using 3 AMTI force plates (Watertown, USA,1000Hz). Three trials of each motion per subject were analyzed. A validated musculoskeletal knee model, including a twelve degree-of-freedom knee joint, knee ligaments, leg muscles and cartilage contact geometry was used to generate dynamic simulations of motion (Lenhart et al., 2015). Enhanced static optimization was used to calculate the muscle forces and secondary knee kinematics for each frame of the motion (Smith et al., 2015). Cartilage pressure was calculated using a non-linear elastic foundation formulation, assuming a Young's modulus of 10 MPa, poisson's ratio of 0.45 and constant cartilage thickness of 2mm for the cartilage layers in the TFJ. Joint loading is analyzed in terms of the force and mean pressure on the tibia averaged over the loaded part of the motions. Differences in averaged contact forces and pressures between motions were analyzed using a friedman two-way analysis of variance by rank. When a significant main effect for motion was found (p <0.01), the motions were individually compared to gait using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p <0.01). Results: Contact forces in the knee were only significantly increased during forward lunge, presenting an increase in all components of the medial condyle contact forces. Walking stairs resulted in contact forces comparable to gait, however with increased anterior-posterior (AP) contact forces on the medial condyle. Although, during STS almost all components of the contact forces were significantly decreased, the AP contact force on the lateral condyle was significantly increased. During all motions (SU, SD, SQ and FL), except sit to stand, the average tibiofemoral pressure across both compartments significantly exceeded pressure during gait (Figure 1). For squatting, a significant increase in lateral condyle pressure was found, due to a significant increase in compressive and AP-forces on the lateral condyle. For the forward lunge, a significantly increased medial condyle pressure was found. Conclusions: Therapeutic exercises load the knee joint more than activities of daily living. Apart from changes in the nature of the forces (i.e. increased AP and ML shear forces), specific load shifts to the medial and lateral compartment can be observed. This is of concern, since these exercises are widely used in physiotherapy, both in rehabilitation after cartilage repair and in the context of OA, irrespective of the lesion site. Both exercises impose more shear forces on the cartilage which have the potential to increase the shear stresses and can possibly be detrimental for the already injured cartilage. Furthermore this can lead to loosening of the newly formed tissue after cartilage repair. Therefore, careful selection of the therapeutic exercises dependent on the local cartilage characteristics should be considered as part of the development of patient-specific re abilitation programs.

TI  - Time Evolution of the Event-Related Desynchronization/Synchronization Index for Investigating Cortical Response Detection Induced by Dynamic Visual Stimuli
PY  - 2013
AB  - The time evolution of the event related ERD/ERS index was used for investigating the cortical response to distinct scene motions in a virtual reality environment. Occipital and parietal EEG leads of 29 healthy subjects were acquired during stabilometric test without and with visual stimulation (dynamic and static virtual scene). The EEG desynchronization in the studied leads was observed for above 93% of the subjects, particularly when the scene moves towards. The time evolution of the (epsilon) over cap (yx) (f) in the ABP ( +/- 1Hz around alpha band peak) and the Wilcoxon test (alpha = 0.05) results allowed to successfully distinguish the EEG evoked response and the effects of stimulating with distinct virtual scene. These findings suggest that control strategies differ with the direction of movement, and indicate the potentiality of the ERD/ERS assessment in studies of postural control during visual stimulation.

TI  - Time and frequency transfer using asynchronous fiber-optical networks: Progress report
PY  - 2009
AB  - SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden has since 2004 been running a project with the aim of performing time and frequency transfer using commercial asynchronous fiberoptical networks. The project is motivated by the need for an alternative and complementary time transfer method on a national basis with the goal of reaching accuracy and stability comparable to satellite-based methods. Previous results using an OC-192/STM-64 10-Gb/s packet over SONET/SDH network show that time transfer accuracy of the order of a few nanoseconds is possible on baselines exceeding 500 km [1]. The method is based on passive listening on existing data traffic and the detection of certain bit sequences in the SDH frame headers continuously transmitted by the network routers. By using two-way time transfer, it is possible to estimate and compensate for symmetric delays in the optical fibers. The method relies on the fact that time-dependent residual delays are small or can be compensated for and constant residual delays can be calibrated. This paper briefly revises the method and presents new results in comparison with the GPS carrier-phase technique, with focus on residual effects due to temperature variations, which have been shown to have a significant impact on the stability and accuracy. It also discusses hardware miniaturizations, as well as new ideas for active time transfer using bitsequence generators/transmitters in dedicated wavelength slots of the optical network. Finally, the use of a subset of the IEEE Standard 1588-2008 (Precise Time Protocol, PTP) for data transport is briefly discussed. © 2009 by Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) - Time Service Department.

TI  - Time complexity of motion planning algorithm for homogeneous combinatorial robots
PY  - 2006
AB  - Some properties and an algorithm of the motion planning problem of homogeneous combinatorial robots are presented. Homogeneous combinatorial robots can be combined and separated freely in the process of moving. The motion planning problem of homogeneous combinatorial robots in a static discrete environment is proven to be compliant to the principle of optimality. A backward dynamic motion planning algorithm is used to find the optimal motion plans. Suppose that vertical bar V vertical bar is the number of all vertices in the graph, n is the number of robots, and k is the number of stages robots passing the graph. The time complexity without considering the limitation function of this problem is O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2nk)). Furthermore, the time complexity with the limitation function of the problem is presented.

TI  - Time course and magnitude of movement-related gating of tactile detection in humans. III. Effect of motor tasks
PY  - 2002
AB  - This study investigated the relative importance of central and peripheral signals for movement-related gating by comparing the time course and magnitude of movement-related decreases in tactile detection during a reference motor task, active isotonic digit 2 (D2) abduction, with that seen during three test tasks: a comparison with active isometric D2 abduction (movement vs. no movement) evaluated the contribution of peripheral reafference generated by the movement to gating; a comparison with passive D2 abduction (motor command vs. no motor command; movement generated by an external agent) allowed us to evaluate the contribution of the central motor command to tactile gating; and finally, the inclusion of an active "no apparatus," or freehand, D2 abduction task allowed us to evaluate the potential contribution of incidental peripheral reafference generated by the position detecting apparatus to the results (apparatus vs. no apparatus). Weak electrical stimuli (2-ms pulse; intensity, 90% detected at rest) were applied to D2 at different delays before and after movement onset or electromyographic (EMG) activity onset. Significant time-dependent movement-related decreases in detection were obtained with all tasks. When the results obtained during the active isotonic movement task were compared with those obtained in the three test tasks, no significant differences in the functions describing detection performance over time were seen. The results obtained with the isometric D2 abduction task show that actual movement of a body part is not necessary to diminish detection of tactile stimuli in a manner similar to the decrease produced by isotonic, active movement. In the passive test task, the peak decrease in detection clearly preceded the onset of passive movement (by 38 ms) despite the lack of a motor command and, presumably, no movement- related peripheral reafference. A slightly but not significantly earlier decrease was obtained with active movement (49 ms before movement onset). Expectation of movement likely did not contribute to the results because stimulus detection during sham passive movement trials (subjects expected but did not receive a passive movement) was not different from performance at rest (no movement). The results obtained with passive movement are best explained by invoking backward masking of the test stimuli by movement- related reafference and demonstrate that movement- related reafference is sufficient to produce decreases in detection with a time course and amplitude not significantly different from that produced by active movement.

TI  - Time course of active and passive liquid and solute movement in the isolated perfused rat lung model
PY  - 1998
AB  - The isolated perfused rat lung model (IL) is used to study alveolar epithelial transport properties. Most of the previous studies have been done over a short period of time and have not used the same preparation as a control and intervention group. We evaluated whether the IL preparation could be used for a prolonged period of time (5 h) and studied the rates of active Na+ transport, lung liquid clearance, and passive movement of solutes. Active Na+ transport and lung liquid clearance were stable from 1 to 5 h. The passive movement of small solutes (Na+, mannitol) did not change significantly, and albumin movement increased slightly at the fifth hour. Total RNA isolated from IL after 5 h was intact, and the Na+-K+-ATPase activity in alveolar type II cells isolated at the end of 5-h experiments was equal to Na+-K+-ATPase function from freshly isolated alveolar type II cells. Finally, we measured the stimulatory effect of the beta-adrenergicagonist terbutaline and the inhibitory effect of the Na+-K(+)ATPase-antagonist ouabain by using the same animal as a control. Accordingly, the isolated perfused lung model is functionally stable for at least 5 h, and it could be utilized to evaluate the effect of different interventions by using the same preparation.

TI  - Time dilation effect in an active observer and virtual environment requires apparent motion: No dilation for retinal- or world-motion alone
PY  - 2019
AB  - It is known that moving visual stimuli are perceived to last longer than stationary stimuli with the same physical duration (Kanai, Paffen, Hogendoorn, & Verstraten, 2006), and that motor actions (Tomassini & Morrone, 2016) and eye movements (Morrone, Ross, & Burr, 2005) can alter perceived duration. In the present work, we investigated the contributions of stimulus motion and self-motion to perceived duration while observers stood or walked in a virtual reality environment. Using a visual temporal reproduction task, we independently manipulated both the participants' motion (stationary or walking) and the stimulus motion (retinal stationary, real-world stationary and negative double velocity). When the observers were standing still, drifting gratings were perceived as lasting longer than duration-matched static gratings. Interestingly, we did not see any time distortion when observers were walking, neither when the gratings were kept stationary relative to the observer's point of view (i.e., no retinal motion) nor when they were stationary in the external world (i.e., producing the same retinal velocity as the walking condition with stationary grating). Self-motion caused significant dilation in perceived duration only when the gratings were moving at double speed, opposite to the observers' walking direction. Consistent with previous work (Fornaciai, Arrighi, & Burr, 2016), this suggests that the system is able to suppress self-generated motion to enhance external motion, which would have ecological benefits, for example, for threat detection while navigating through the environment.

TI  - Time reversal technique for gas leakage detection
PY  - 2015
AB  - The acoustic remote sensing of subsea gas leakage traditionally uses sonars as active acoustic sensors and hydrophones picking up the sound generated by a leak as passive sensors. When gas leaks occur underwater, bubbles are produced and emit sound at frequencies intimately related to their sizes. The experimental implementation of an acoustic time-reversal mirror (TRM) is now well established in underwater acoustics. In the basic TRM experiment, a probe source emits a pulse that is received on an array of sensors, time reversed, and re-emitted. After time reversal, the resulting field focuses back at the probe position. In this study, a method for enhancing operation of the passive receiving system has been proposed by using it in the regime of TRM. Two factors, the local character of the acoustic emission signal caused by the leakage and a resonant nature of the bubble radiation at their birth, make particularly effective scattering with the conjugate wave (CW). Analytical calculations are performed for the scattering of CW wave on a single bubble when CW is formed by bubble birthing wail received on an array, time reversed, and re-emitted. The quality of leakage detection depends on the spatio-temporal distribution of ambient noise. (c) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Time scale dependent viscoelastic and contractile regimes in fibroblasts probed by microplate manipulation
PY  - 1997
AB  - Many essential phenomena in biology involve changes in cell shape, Cell deformation occurs in response to physical forces either coming from the external environment or intracellularly generated, In most tests of cell rheology, an external constraint is usually superimposed on an already mechanically active cell, thus the measurements may reflect both active motion and passive viscoelastic deformation, To show that active and passive processes could be distinguished on a time scale basis, we designed a novel piezo-controlled micromanipulation system to impose dynamic mechanical deformations on individual cells, Chick fibroblasts were seized between two glass microplates; one of the plates, more flexible, served as a sensor of the applied force, Controlled amounts of unidirectional compression and traction in the range of 10(-8)-10(-7) N were applied, using either step functions or sinusoidal signals at chosen frequencies, These tests allowed identification of three time scale dependent regimes, (1) A dominant elastic response, characterized by a linear stress-strain relationship, was especially apparent at short times (seconds); (2) A viscous behavior, characterized by force relaxation and irreversible cell deformation, was noticeable at intermediate times (minutes), Data from traction and oscillatory excitation tests were well fitted by a three-element Kelvin viscoelastic model, allowing the calculation of two elastic moduli in the range of 600-1,000 N/m(2) and an apparent viscosity of about 10(4) Pa.s. (3) A contractile regime, in which actin-dependent traction forces were developed in response to uniaxial load was apparent at longer times (several tens of minutes), These forces were in the order of 4 x 10(-8) N above viscous relaxation. Thus we could distinguish, on a time scale basis, the specific contributions of passive viscoelasticity and active traction, and evaluate their mechanical characteristics within one experiment on a single cell.

TI  - Time-Domain Kalman Filter for Active Noise Cancellation Headphones
PY  - 2017
AB  - Noise pollution has a large negative influence on the health of humans, especially in case of long-term exposure. Various passive hearing protection approaches are available. However, they often lack good protection against low frequency noise. For these applications, the principle of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) offers a promising supplement. It relies on anti-phase compensation of the noise signal. Within the area of ANC, only few publications deal with the Kalman filter approach. The state-of-the-art in literature is briefly reviewed. The algorithm presented in this contribution is inspired by the time-domain Kalman filter. The Kalman filter has the favorable property of fast convergence as well as good tracking properties. Especially the tracking of time-varying noise conditions is often a drawback of least-mean-square (LMS) and recursive-least-square (RLS) approaches. The proposed algorithm uses the Kalman equations which are extended by online model parameter estimation based on observable signals. This results in faster convergence and higher robustness against dynamically changing noise conditions. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by means of convergence, tracking and stability with measured acoustic paths from a real-time system.

TI  - Time-Frequency Modulation of ERD and EEG Coherence in Robot-Assisted Hand Performance
PY  - 2015
AB  - A better understanding of cortical modifications related to movement preparation and execution after robot-assisted training could aid in refining rehabilitation therapy protocols for stroke patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) modifications of cortical activity in healthy subjects were evaluated using time-frequency event-related EEG and task-related coherence (TRCoh). Twenty-one channel EEG was recorded in eight subjects during protocols of active, passive, and imagined movements. The subjects performed robot-assisted tasks using the Bi-Manu-Track robot-assisted arm trainer. We applied time-frequency event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) and TRCoh approaches to investigate where movement-related decreases in power were localized and to study the functional relationships between areas. Our results showed ERD of sensorimotor (SM) area over the contralateral side before the movement and bilateral ERD during execution of the movement. ERD during passive movements was similar in topography to that observed during voluntary movements, but without pre-movement components. No significant difference in time course ERD was observed among the three types of movement over the two SM areas. The TRCoh topography was similar for active and imagined movement; before passive movement, the frontal regions were uncoupled from the SM regions and did not contribute to task performance. This study suggests new perspectives for the evaluation of brain oscillatory activity and the neurological assessment of motor performance by means of quantitative EEG to better understand the planning and execution of movement.

TI  - Time-Resolved MRI After Ingestion of Liquids Reveals Motility Changes After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy-Preliminary Results
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is generally considered a restrictive procedure. However, studies with nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated that gastric motility changes occur following LSG. These motility changes could represent complementary mechanisms of weight loss. Therefore, we analyzed the stomach motility before and after LSG by means of dynamic MRI.Methods In this prospective pilot study, five female patients with a mean BMI of 51.6 kg/m(2) underwent MRI 1 day before LSG and 6 days and 6 months after LSG. Dynamic steady-state free precession sequences were used to analyze the gastric motility after ingestion of 500 ml water with a temporal resolution of 0.86 s. Axial image stacks were also repeatedly acquired to determine the intragastric fluid volume over time.Results Mean excess body mass index loss was 60.6% after 6 months. Dynamic analysis showed that antral propulsive peristalsis was preserved immediately after surgery and during follow-up, but fold speed increased significantly from 2.7 mm/s before LSG to 4.4 mm/s after 6 months. The sleeve itself remained without recognizable peristalsis in three patients and showed only uncoordinated or passive motion in two patients. Consequently, the fluid transport through the sleeve was markedly delayed, whereas the antrum showed accelerated propulsion with the emptying half-time decreasing from 16.5 min preoperatively to 7.9 min 6 months after surgery.Conclusions Owing to the LSG procedure, the stomach is functionally divided into a sleeve without propulsive peristalsis and an accelerated antrum. Accelerated emptying seems to be caused by faster peristaltic folds.

TI  - Time-dependent Neural Processing of Auditory Feedback during Voice Pitch Error Detection
PY  - 2011
AB  - The neural responses to sensory consequences of a self-produced motor act are suppressed compared with those in response to a similar but externally generated stimulus. Previous studies in the somatosensory and auditory systems have shown that the motor-induced suppression of the sensory mechanisms is sensitive to delays between the motor act and the onset of the stimulus. The present study investigated time-dependent neural processing of auditory feedback in response to self-produced vocalizations. ERPs were recorded in response to normal and pitch-shifted voice auditory feedback during active vocalization and passive listening to the playback of the same vocalizations. The pitch-shifted stimulus was delivered to the subjects' auditory feedback after a randomly chosen time delay between the vocal onset and the stimulus presentation. Results showed that the neural responses to delayed feedback perturbations were significantly larger than those in response to the pitch-shifted stimulus occurring at vocal onset. Active vocalization was shown to enhance neural responsiveness to feedback alterations only for nonzero delays compared with passive listening to the playback. These findings indicated that the neural mechanisms of auditory feedback processing are sensitive to timing between the vocal motor commands and the incoming auditory feedback. Time-dependent neural processing of auditory feedback may be an important feature of the audio-vocal integration system that helps to improve the feedback-based monitoring and control of voice structure through vocal error detection and correction.

TI  - Time-dependent supersonic separation of tangent bodies
PY  - 1996
AB  - An experimental, time-dependent separation of tangent bodies was performed in a supersonic wind tunnel (Mach 1.5 and 1.9) to investigate the significance of transient effects and the suitability of using steady-state assumptions to predict a dynamic separation event. Model configurations consisted of two bodies placed in a near tangent position, A stationary body, a plate or ogive, was instrumented to obtain dynamic surface pressures, while a second body, a wedge attached to an air cylinder was plunged in a constrained motion away from and toward the stationary model. Three-dimensional flow expansion around the edge of the wedge reduced the strength of incident shock waves and created a region of low pressure, near freestream static, on body surfaces between the incident and reflection shock waves. Dynamic motion of the wedge did not significantly affect shock-wave development between the bodies, and steady-state corrections that accounted for the motion-induced wedge angle were appropriate for predicting time-dependent surface pressures induced by the incident shock wave. However, unsteady pressures caused from the motion of the wedge were evident when separation distances were less than 20% of the wedge width.

TI  - Time-of-flight distance measurement with with custom custom solid-state image sensors in CMOS / CCD-technology
PY  - 2000
AB  - Since we are living in a three-dimensional world, an adequate description of our environment for many applications includes the relative position and motion of the different objects in a scene. Nature has satisfied this need for spatial perception by providing most animals with at least two eyes. This stereo vision ability is the basis that allows the brain to calculate qualitative depth information of the observed scene. Another important parameter in the complex human depth perception is our experience and memory. Although it is far more difficult, a human being is even able to recognize depth information without stereo vision. For example, we can qualitatively deduce the 3D scene from most photos, assuming that the photos contain known objects COR. The acquisition, storage, processing and comparison of such a huge amount of information requires enormous computational power - with which nature fortunately provides us. Therefore, for a technical implementation, one should resort to other simpler measurement principles. Additionally, the qualitative distance estimates of such knowledge-based passive vision systems can be replaced by accurate range measurements. Imaging 3D measurement with useful distance resolution has mainly been realized so far with triangulation systems, either passive triangulation (stereo vision) or active triangulation (e.g. projected fringe methods). These triangulation systems have to deal with shadowing effects and ambiguity problems (projected fringe), which often restrict the range of application areas. Moreover, stereo vision cannot be used to measure a contrastless scene. This is because the basic principle of stereo vision is the extraction of characteristic contrast-related features within the observed scene and the comparison of their position within the two images. Also, extracting the 3D information from the measured data requires an enormous timeconsuming computational effort. High resolution can only be achieved with a relatively large triangulation base and hence large camera systems.

TI  - Time-variant spectral peak and notch detection in echolocation-call sequences in bats
PY  - 2008
AB  - Bats are able to recognize and discriminate three-dimensional objects in complete darkness by analyzing the echoes of their ultrasonic emissions. Bats typically ensonify objects from different aspects to gain an internal representation of the three-dimensional object shape. Previous work suggests that, as a result, bats rely on the echo-acoustic analysis of spectral peaks and notches. Dependent on the aspect of ensonification, this spectral interference pattern changes over time in an object-specific manner. The speed with which the bats' auditory system can follow time-variant spectral interference patterns is unknown. Here, we measured the detection thresholds for temporal variations in the spectral content of synthesized echolocation calls in the echolocating bat, Megaderma lyra. In a two-alternative, forced-choice procedure, bats were trained to discriminate synthesized echolocation-call sequences with time-variant spectral peaks or notches from echolocation-call sequences with invariant peaks or notches. Detection thresholds of the spectral modulations were measured by varying the modulation depth of the time-variant echolocation-call sequences for modulation rates ranging from 2 to 16 Hz. Both for spectral peaks and notches, modulation-detection thresholds were at a modulation depth of similar to 11% of the centre frequency. Interestingly, thresholds were relatively independent of modulation rate. Acknowledging reservations about direct comparisons of active-acoustic and passive-acoustic auditory processing, the effectual sensitivity and modulation-rate independency of the obtained results indicate that the bats are well capable of tracking changes in the spectral composition of echoes reflected by complex objects from different angles.

TI  - Timing and route of migration of mature female blue crabs in a tidal estuary
PY  - 2015
AB  - Information on migration patterns is critical to using no-take migratory corridors and marine reserves to protect the spawning stock of commercially exploited species. Both active and passive acoustic tracking methods quantified movement of commercially and ecologically important blue crabs in the White Oak River estuary, NC, USA. We targeted post-mating female crabs migrating down-estuary to oceanic spawning grounds. Crabs travelled approximately 14.1 km mainly in deeper channels and over 12-26 days from mating areas to spawning grounds. No crabs were detected migrating down-estuary in the autumn and only 30% were detected migrating down-estuary in spring. None of the crabs detected near spawning grounds were detected or recaptured back up-estuary, suggesting that they either (i) do not return to the estuary after a one to two week period in the spawning area or (ii) were captured by fishermen. The results from this study demonstrate that (1) acoustic transmitters coupled with passive acoustic receivers provided reliable and valuable data on migration patterns of mature female blue crabs and (2) mature female blue crabs are capable of migrating primarily within deep channels to spawning grounds shortly after insemination.

TI  - Timing of Visual Bodily Behavior in Repair Sequences: Evidence From Three Languages
PY  - 2016
AB  - This article expands the study of other-initiated repair in conversation—when one party signals a problem with producing or perceiving another's turn at talk—into the domain of visual bodily behavior. It presents one primary cross-linguistic finding about the timing of visual bodily behavior in repair sequences: if the party who initiates repair accompanies their turn with a “hold”—when relatively dynamic movements are temporarily and meaningfully held static—this position will not be disengaged until the problem is resolved and the sequence closed. We base this finding on qualitative and quantitative analysis of corpora of conversational interaction from three unrelated languages representing two different modalities: Northern Italian, the Cha'palaa language of Ecuador, and Argentine Sign Language. The cross-linguistic similarities uncovered by this comparison suggest that visual bodily practices have been semiotized for similar interactive functions across different languages and modalities due to common pressures in face-to-face interaction. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - TinkRBook: Shared Reading Interfaces for Storytelling
PY  - 2011
AB  - Today, the way children learn to read is very different from the way they learn from playing with toys. Books present static images and text on the page, whereas toys allow for manipulation and interactive exploration of cause-effect relations. What if books were "tinkerable"? What if children could actively explore and modify a story, through voice and touch, to dynamically explore meaning as conveyed by the relationship of text to illustrated concept? How might this change how books are experienced, explored, and shared between parent and child? How might interactivity support and enhance existing shared reading practices?We report the development of interaction design techniques for encouraging storytelling behavior during shared book reading. The design of our storytelling platform, the TinkRBook, encourages active exploration when parents read to very young children (ages 2-5 years old). Our approach uses findings from insitu parent-child ethnographies and advice from 24 participatory design interviews with researchers, designers and professionals from relevant domains. We believe that our approach addresses the environmental conditions in which interactive storytelling with preschoolers is most likely to be adopted, and is compatible with current shared reading practices.

TI  - Tissue Doppler echocardiography: principles and applications.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Tissue velocity imaging is an important development in the field of cardiac ultrasound that provides quantitative information for analysis of myocardial motion independent of the quality of gray-scale 2-D echocardiography data. It holds promise to reduce inter- and intraobserver variability in regional wall motion interpretation and is likely to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of stress echocardiography and myocardial viability assessment. It also enables regional diastolic function assessment independent of the loading conditions and offers a practical clinical tool to differentiate pathologic from physiologic myocardial hypertrophy, restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis and for monitoring and selecting therapies in patients with advanced heart failure. The use of tissue velocity data for myocardial strain and strain rate imaging is likely to circumvent the limitations of tissue velocity in differentiating active and passive motion of a myocardial segment. However, its incremental utility and exact role in improving the diagnostic yield and clinical outcome needs to be addressed in future studies.

TI  - To be different - A study of transsexual patients [Le test de Rorschach et la pensée opératoire dans l'approche théorique du transsexualisme]
PY  - 2005
AB  - The authors studied the outcome of Rorschach tests on 28 transsexuals who had applied for sex reassignment surgery. The results were analysed on a 63-item grid. The transsexuals and the control group were matched by biological sex, age and education level. For the interpretation of the results, the authors refer to: a)- psychodynamic theory (C. Chabert); b)- L. Cassier's symbol elaboration index (SEI); c)- some aspects of the Exner method. The various indexes produce significant figures: - Subject's very low SEI levels suggests a defect in symbolization capacity bringing their mental processes close to those of operatory thought: i)- a deficit in emotional control (CF+C>FC); ii)- the passive movements count (Kau+K) is higher than the active movements count (Snow White index confirmed), signifying a tendency to look to others to resolve problems in reality. What are the applications of this new approach to transsexualism? We find the elements of operatory thought dear to P. Marty to be characteristic of the mental functioning of transsexuals: difficulty in feeling and expressing emotional states, life of the imagination reduced to the factual, and concretely-oriented thought processes. Operatory thought can be constituent of the development of the ego and be rooted in the essentiel depression of the infant. It may also represent an "extreme" defence mechanism against an "extreme" threat endangering the ego. In this case it may be only transitory and open to evolution. This psychosomatic model directly influences the accompaniment of patients who would benefit, in psychotherapy, from help in gaining better access to symbolization. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

TI  - Tonic stretch reflex threshold: A new standard in spasticity measurement
PY  - 2014
AB  - Objectives: A number of systematic reviews have questioned the validity of evaluation tools traditionally used to measure spasticity in the clinical setting. As an example, the most widely used clinical measure; the Modified Ashworth Scale measures the total muscular resistance to passive movement rather than stretch reflex excitability per se. Although the presence or absence of spasticity may be identified using current clinical scales, the accuracy of determination of spasticity severity and the relationship between severity level and deficits of voluntary movements remain elusive. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the validity and reliability of a new measure of spasticity: the stretch reflex threshold, using a portable measurement device. Methods: An alternative approach to the measurement of spasticity is the evaluation of the excitability of motoneurons (tonic stretch reflex threshold; TSRT) resulting from both descending and segmental influences. It is well established that, in healthy subjects, the regulation of TSRTs may be a major mechanism underlying the control of posture and movement. Previous studies have shown that spasticity and disordered muscle activation in persons with central nervous system lesions are related to deficits in the regulation of TSRTs throughout the biomechanical joint range. The TSRT measure identifies where, in the joint range, problems in modulation of muscle activity begin. According to the SRT measure, a higher value indicates a higher threshold and, therefore, a lower level of spasticity and vice versa. This study investigated the intra- and inter-evaluator reliability of TSRT measurement in different muscle groups to quantify spasticity in patients with chronic stroke-related spasticity using a portable device and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Intraevaluator reliability was examined by comparing data collected on 2 days, while data collected by two or more evaluators on the same day were used to determine inter-evaluator reliability. For each evaluation, EMG signals and joint angular position were recorded during 20 stretches of the spastic muscle applied at different velocities. Results: Velocity-dependent dynamic stretch reflex thresholds (angular position at which the muscle is activated for a given stretch velocity) were recorded. These values were used to compute TSRTs which reflects the excitability of motoneurons at 0° s-1. Intra- and inter-evaluator reliability of TSRT measurement was moderately good for evaluating elbow flexor spasticity, especially for subjects with moderate-to-high spasticity (intra-evaluator: ICC=0.46-0.68 and inter-evaluator: ICC=0.53-0.68). For the plantarflexors, inter-evaluator reliability was very good (ICC=0.85). The TSRT measure did not correlate with resistance to stretch (MAS). Conclusions: The TSRT measure overcomes most of the limitations posed by currently available clinical measures of spasticity. As the TSRT relates spasticity to deficits in voluntary movement and is also sensitive to subtle changes in spasticity, it may guide clinical decisionmaking.

TI  - Top-down influence on the visual cortex of the blind during sensory substitution
PY  - 2016
AB  - Visual sensory substitution devices provide a non-surgical and flexible approach to vision rehabilitation in the blind. These devices convert images taken by a camera into cross-modal sensory signals that are presented as a surrogate for direct visual input. While previous work has demonstrated that the visual cortex of blind subjects is recruited during sensory substitution, the cognitive basis of this activation remains incompletely understood. To test the hypothesis that top-down input provides a significant contribution to this activation, we performed functional MRI scanning in 11 blind (7 acquired and 4 congenital) and 11 sighted subjects under two conditions: passive listening of image-encoded soundscapes before sensory substitution training and active interpretation of the same auditory sensory substitution signals after a 10-minute training session. We found that the modulation of visual cortex activity due to active interpretation was significantly stronger in the blind over sighted subjects. In addition, congenitally blind subjects showed stronger task-induced modulation in the visual cortex than acquired blind subjects. In a parallel experiment, we scanned 18 blind (11 acquired and 7 congenital) and 18 sighted subjects at rest to investigate alterations in functional connectivity due to visual deprivation. The results demonstrated that visual cortex connectivity of the blind shifted away from sensory networks and toward known areas of top-down input. Taken together, our data support the model of the brain, including the visual system, as a highly flexible task-based and not sensory-based machine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Top-down modulation of early sensory cortex
PY  - 1997
AB  - Data from nine previous studies of human visual information processing using positron emission tomography were reanalyzed to contrast blood flow responses during passive viewing and active discriminations of the same stimulus array. The analysis examined whether active visual processing (i) increases blood flow in medial visual regions early in the visual hierarchy and (ii) decreases blood flow in auditory and somatosensory cortex. Significant modulation of medial visual regions was observed in six of nine studies, indicating that top down processes can affect early visual cortex. Modulations showed several task dependencies, suggesting that in some cases the underlying mechanism was selective (e.g. analysis-or feature-specific) rather than non-selective. Replicable decreases at or near auditory Brodmann area (BA) left 41/42 were observed in two of five studies, but in different locations. Analyses that combined data across studies yielded modest but significant decreases. Replicable decreases were not found in primary somatosensory cortex but were observed in an insular region that may be a somatosensory association area. Decreases were also noted in the parietal operculum (perhaps SII) and BA 40. These results are inconsistent with a model in which the precortical input to task-irrelevant sensory cortical areas is broadly suppressed.

TI  - Top-down modulation of shape and roughness discrimination in active touch by covert attention
PY  - 2019
AB  - Due to limitations in perceptual processing, information relevant to momentary task goals is selected from the vast amount of available sensory information by top-down mechanisms (e.g. attention) that can increase perceptual performance. We investigated how covert attention affects perception of 3D objects in active touch. In our experiment, participants simultaneously explored the shape and roughness of two objects in sequence, and were told afterwards to compare the two objects with regard to one of the two features. To direct the focus of covert attention to the different features we manipulated the expectation of a shape or roughness judgment by varying the frequency of trials for each task (20%, 50%, 80%), then we measured discrimination thresholds. We found higher discrimination thresholds for both shape and roughness perception when the task was unexpected, compared to the conditions in which the task was expected (or both tasks were expected equally). Our results suggest that active touch perception is modulated by expectations about the task. This implies that despite fundamental differences, active and passive touch are affected by feature selective covert attention in a similar way.

TI  - Topics in Geriatric Rehabilitation Shoulder Manual Therapy for Aging and Older Adults-Part 2: Adhesive Capsulitis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a common cause of shoulder pain in aging and older adults. This narrative review synthesizes recent literature on manual therapy to the shoulder joint for AC. Emphasis has been placed on summarizing high-quality randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews with a narrative synthesis or meta-analysis, and clinical practice guidelines. The synthesis suggests that while there is limited high-quality evidence, manual therapy and exercise seem effective in improving outcomes in aging and older adults with AC, and there is limited evidence to support the superiority of manual therapy over other interventions. Additional research using consistent outcome measures is needed to establish the optimal manual therapy techniques and parameters for AC, both alone and in combination with exercise. Research that focuses exclusively on the effects of manual therapy on aging and older adults with AC is warranted. PT, MPT, OCS, ATC peaks for women 50 to 59 years of age (129/10 000) and for men 60 to 69 years of age (116/10 000). 5 And in the United States, the annual direct costs for the treatment of shoulder pain exceeds $7 billion each year. 6 Adhesive capsulitis (AC) ranks as the third most common subgroup/cause of shoulder pain, only after rotator cuff syndrome (fi rst) and subacromial impingement (sec-ond). When disaggregating the data by diagnostic code, the new onset consultation rate for AC in Sweden is 12/ 10 000 for women and 6/10 000 for men, and the annual consultation prevalence is 15/10 000 for women and 9/10 000 for men. 5 Although beyond the scope of this paper, there are several useful reviews on the pathophysiology including staging, imaging, and conservative and surgical management of AC. 7-10 Walmsley and colleagues 11 recently reported movement and pain patterns in patients (mean = 55.2 ± 6.9 years) with early stage primary/idiopathic AC using factor analysis and external rotation in abduction emerging as the most painful active and passive movement, and movement was most frequently limited by pain. Jewell et al 12 conducted a retrospective cohort study and found that the use of joint mobilization and mobility increased the odds (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confi dence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.65) of a meaningful improvement on the Bodily Pain subscale of the PCS-12. What follows is a synthesis of recent literature on manual therapy to the shoulder joint for 1 of the most common causes of shoulder pain in aging and older adults, AC. Emphasis has been placed on summarizing high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews with a narrative synthesis or meta-analysis, and clinical practice guidelines. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS Several RCTs have examined the effectiveness of manual therapy on AC. Even though the purpose of this review was to focus on recent publications, we included several studies older than 10 years as they were frequently cited in the literature and often included in systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines. Studies were then grouped on the basis of the comparison group used, which includes exercise, a nonmanual therapy group (eg, modalities), different manual therapy techniques, and medical management (eg, steroid injections and surgery). S houlder pain is the third most common musculoskel-etal reason for physician consultation 1 , 2 and the second most common musculoskeletal problem reason for physical therapy (PT). 3 Luime and colleagues 4 synthesized the fi ndings from 18 studies on the prevalence and 1 study on the incidence of shoulder pain from the general populations of the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, Nige-ria, Finland, the United States, Cuba, South Africa, Norway, and Denmark. Point prevalence is 6.9% to 26%, 1-month prevalence is 18.6% to 31%, 1-year prevalence is 4.7% to 46.7%, and lifetime prevalence is 6.7% to 66.7% for shoulder pain. Incidence data were reported by age groups-0.9% for those 31 to 35 years, 2.5% for 42 to 46 years, 1.1% for 56 to 60 years, and 1.6% for 70 to 74 years. In Sweden, the new onset consultation rate (per year) due to shoulder pain

TI  - Topographic mapping of midlatency auditory responses depends on actual cognitive task
PY  - 1997
AB  - We investigated whether Pb is influenced by active perceptual cognitive states. Ten normal volunteers served as subjects. Midlatency auditory responses (MLRs) were obtained from 15 electrodes on the scalp, attached to the tip of the nose. In a passive listening task, pure tones of 1,000 and 2,000 Hz, respectively, were binaurally presented via headphones. In an active perceptual cognitive task, the 1,000 and 2,000 Hz pure tones were given in a random sequence, each occurring 50% of the time. In each task two blocks, each consisting of 125 artifact-free trials, were grand averaged off-line. The topographic distribution of Pb was dominant at Ct in all recording states in all subjects, and showed significant difference between the active perceptual cognitive tasks and the passive listening tasks, its amplitude was statistically higher during the active perceptual cognitive tasks than the passive listening tasks. In conclusion, Pb may be influenced by the actual perceptual cognitive states.

TI  - Topographical EEG differences between schizophrenic patients and controls during neuropsychological functional activation
PY  - 1990
AB  - Ten DSM III schizophrenic patients belonging to an Active syndrome were compared with 10 age- and sex-matched normal controls on neuropsychological tests with concurrent monitoring of topographical EEG using a brain imager with a 28-electrode array. In line with predictions, abnormalities in patients were found in tests involving right hemispheric functions. Deficits were found in recognition memory for faces as distinct from a verbal recognition memory task. Right temporo-parietal involvement in the faces task was confirmed by an absence of beta II amplitude reduction in patients compared with controls in the right temporo-parietal region. A similar anomaly occured in patients in a left- but not right-hand finger-thumb apposition test in left anterior and right posterior regions, and also in a passive visual fixation task where it was located bilaterally in the occipito-parietal region. Functional activation with neuropsychological tests holds promise as one approach to the validation of topographical mapping of brain electrical activity. © 1990.

TI  - Topography and dipole analysis of reafferent electrical brain activity following the Bereitschaftspotential
PY  - 1997
AB  - The cerebral events related to limb movements can be studied noninvasively with the method of evoked potentials, In this study, a brain potential is analysed that follows the onset of a simple finger movement, Because this potential occurred after active as well as after passive movements, its previously alleged reafferent somatosensory nature is confirmed in this study. Detailed topographic analysis revealed that this potential has the same polarity and merges with the preceeding Bereitschaftspotential (BP; in the active movement) at central electrodes, whereas at parietal electrodes polarity is opposite to the BP. In individual subjects, the maximum of the BP and the peak of the reafferent potential are separated by a small gap, previously described as pre-motion positivity. A comparison with the N20 potential of the electrically evoked somatosensory potential showed similar potential topography, albeit opposite polarity. The dipole analysis supported the view that the reafferent and the electrically evoked potentials are likely to arise from the same cortical area, namely the primary somatosensory cortex.

TI  - Torque feedback control of dry friction clutches for a dissipative passive haptic interface
PY  - 2000
AB  - The control of a passive dissipative haptic interface using electromagnetic dry friction clutches as actuators is considered. The performance of the device is currently limited by actuator performance. A dynamic simulation of the system indicates that actuator torque may be better controlled with torque feedback, resulting in improved path-following performance of the haptic interface. Experimental tests are presented which illustrate the validity of the simulation and the feasibility of implementing torque feedback control on the system's clutches.

TI  - Torsional compliance coefficients of a rigid circular plate in generalized Gibson saturated soil
PY  - 2015
AB  - With considering the vertical heterogeneity of soil layers and the feature of torsional vibration, the dynamic motion equations of a generalized Gibson saturated soil are developed. Then the proposed equations are solved by using the integral transformation. Given the stress-free boundary condition at the top surface of the saturated half-space, the mixed boundary condition in the plane where the rigid circular plate is laid, and the wave radiation condition at the infinite depth, the dual integral equations are developed to depict the torsional vibration of a rigid circular plate embedded in a generalized Gibson saturated soil. By appropriate transformation, a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind is obtained; and the dynamic response of the soil is determined. The dynamic compliance coefficient and the torsional angular amplitude is formulated by comparing the relation between a static torque and angular displacement. The problem can be degenerated into a simple case, which is consistent with previous research results. Numerical studies indicate that there exists a boundary-layer phenomenon in the torsional vibration of a rigid circular plate in a generalized Gibson soil when the embedment depth is five-times smaller than the radius of the circular plate; in addition, the smaller embedment depth, the more pronounced the boundary-layer phenomenon is.

TI  - Total Divorce Rate in Israel
PY  - 2016
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the size distribution of young firms within some selected industries, trying to assess the empirical implications of different models of industry dynamics: the model of passive learning (Jovanovic 1982), the model of active learning (Ericson and Pakes, 1995), and the evolutionary model (Audretsch, 1995). We use a non-parametric technique, the Kernel density estimator, applied to a data set from the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS), consisting in 12 cohorts of new manufacturing firms followed for 6 years. Since the patterns of convergence to the limit distribution are different between industries, we conclude that the model of passive learning is consistent with some of them, the active exploration model with others, the evolutionary model with all of them.

TI  - Total knee arthroplasty with computer-assisted navigation more closely replicates normal knee biomechanics than conventional surgery
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Computer-assisted navigation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) reduces variability and may improve accuracy in the postoperative static alignment. The effect of navigation on alignment and biomechanics during more dynamic movements has not been investigated.Methods: This study compared knee biomechanics during level walking of 121 participants: 39 with conventional TKA, 42 with computer-assisted navigation TKA and 40 unimpaired control participants.Results: Standing lower-limb alignment was significantly closer to ideal in participants with navigation TKA. During gait, when differences in walking speed were accounted for, participants with conventional TKA had less knee flexion during stance and swing than controls (P < 0.01), but there were no differences between participants with navigation TKA and controls for the same variables. Both groups of participants with TKA had lower knee adduction moments than controls (P < 0.01).Conclusions: In summary, there were fewer differences in the biomechanics of computer-assisted navigation TKA patients compared to controls than for patients with conventional TKA. Computer-assisted navigation TKA may restore biomechanics during walking that are closer to normal than conventional TKA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Total shoulder replacement [UNE PROTHESE TOTALE D'EPAULE]
PY  - 1973
AB  - The author reports an operation of total replacement of the shoulder based on the principle of inversion of the articular surfaces. The cup is fixed by means of a rod sealed into the humeral diaphysis, and the sphere is screwed on the scapula, by means of a support which presses on the glenoid cavity. The polyethylene cup is semiretentional and turns in all directions on the metallic sphere, permitting at least passively without any risk of dislocation, all required movements. The stability of the shoulder and the lack of pain were obtained in all patients operated on (11 cases including 6 with sufficient follow up). In regard to active movements, there is a problem of muscle physiology which remains unsolved. The cup plays a passive role and cannot replace the active role of the muscle tendon capsule, which should be preserved. Research on this subject continues and it is mainly the model of the prosthesis and the means of fixation which are presented here.

TI  - Touching the Invisible: Localizing Ultrasonic Haptic Cues
PY  - 2015
AB  - While mid-air gestures offer new possibilities to interact with or around devices, some situations, such as interacting with applications, playing games or navigating, may require visual attention to be focused on a main task. Ultrasonic haptic feedback can provide 3D spatial haptic cues that do not demand visual attention for these contexts. In this paper, we present an initial study of active exploration of ultrasonic haptic virtual points that investigates the spatial localization with and without the use of the visual modality. Our results show that, when providing haptic feedback giving the location of a widget, users perform 50% more accurately compared to providing visual feedback alone. When provided with a haptic location of a widget alone, users are more than 30% more accurate than when given a visual location. When aware of the location of the haptic feedback, active exploration decreased the minimum recommended widget size from 2cm(2) to 1cm(2) when compared to passive exploration from previous studies. Our results will allow designers to create better mid-air interactions using this new form of haptic feedback.

TI  - Toward Decentralised Consensus and Offloading for Area Coverage in a Fleet of Drones
PY  - 2018
AB  - A precise and dynamic visual coverage of a given area is an essential task in many smart contexts, ranging from civil communities to military applications. Due to the last years advancement in hardware miniaturization and efficiency, area coverage is often performed with a combination of static and moving devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). Drones are useful to cope with the highly unpredictability and dynamicity of environments, but require specific and efficient solutions toward and efficient area coverage. In this paper we proposes an initial work toward a drone-based approach for the task of area coverage. In particular, we focus our analysis on the following points: (i) decentralized consensus for movement planning, and (ii) the integration of cloud computing infrastructures and technologies for computation offloading, both for image analysis and movement planning.

TI  - Toward a "situated" view of the aesthetic in music education
PY  - 2002
AB  - Specifically, Elliott and others have disputed (1) the exclusive focus on internal features of a musical work, that is, the musical elements or structural properties of musical works, resulting in a Eurocentric view of music as autonomous object (MM, 21-38)3; (2) the emphasis on musical engagement as passive listening rather than active "musicking" (MM, 21-38); and (3) the emphasis on verbal response to music listening as the primary means of obtaining knowledge concerning children's understandings of music (MM, 21-38). From the above it may be argued that the aesthetic task in music education encompasses not only recognition of formal elements, but also acknowledgment of the intersection between formal elements and factors such as: referential and expressive elements of music; the "prejudices" (this term is used in Gadamer's non-pejorative sense) brought to the experience by participants in the experience; the contexts of the experience; and the meaning-making and meaning-using processes that are embedded in that experience.19 This latter aspect is emphasized as not only is the art object or event a product of particular social and cultural contexts, the ways in which it is construed, the meaning-making and meaning-using processes employed, are contingent upon social and cultural processes. "24 This emphasis on perception and cognition has evolved into a largely uncontested assumption that in helping "students perceive music more deeply so that their reactions to it can be concomitantly deep," the principal mode of engagement is that of "passive" audience-listener.25 A further legacy of this view has been an emphasis on verbal response to musical stimuli as a means of making judgments concerning children's musical understanding. [...]artefacts can range from books and videotapes that tacitly embody shared cultural understandings... to statistical tools and socially shared symbol systems.29 Craig's composition provides important evidence of an understanding of some features of musical structure and form within the confines of a specific style, an understanding that is demonstrated through the composition rather than stated verbally.

TI  - Toward a psychophysics of agency: Detecting gain and loss of control over auditory action effects
PY  - 2007
AB  - Theories of agency-the feeling of being in control of one's actions and their effects-emphasize either perceptual or cognitive aspects. This study addresses both aspects simultaneously in a finger-tapping paradigm. The tasks required participants to detect when synchronization of their taps with computer-controlled tones changed to self-controlled production of tones, or the reverse. For comparison, the tone sequences recorded in these active tapping conditions were also presented in passive listening conditions, in which participants had to detect the transition from computer to human control, or vice versa. Signal detection theory was applied to separate sensitivity from bias. Sensorimotor cues to agency were found to increase sensitivity in the active conditions compared with the passive conditions, which provided only perceptual cues. Analysis of bias revealed a tendency to attribute action effects to self-control. Thus, judgments of agency rely on veridical sensorimotor cues but can also be subject to cognitive bias.

AB  - Smoke detection is an important part of automatic fire surveillance system whose goal is to provide emergency response in the event of unexpected fire hazards. A new approach for smoke detection is proposed based on static and dynamic visual features that could be automatically extracted from video sequences which is then aggregated into a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and a decision making system in order to combine the features of smoke meaningfully. Experimental results on different video frames show the effectiveness of the proposed smoke detection system with respect to other state-of-The-Art algorithms. © 2017 CRL Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Toward the design and evaluation of continuous sound in tangible interfaces: The Spinotron
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper reports on an approach to the design of continuous sonic feedback in tangible interfaces, and oil quantitative evaluation methods intended to guide such design tasks. The issues it addresses may be of central relevance to areas of the emerging discipline of sonic interaction design that have begun to address the unique problems of designing sound for highly interactive contexts. Three experiments were conducted to assess two key aspects of the sound design developed for ail abstract object designed for these experiments, which we refer to its the Spinotron. First, a comparison of sound source identification was made between three cases: passive listening to temporally static sounds. passive listening to dynamically evolving sounds; and listening to sounds generated through active manipulation of the artifact. The results show that control over the sound production process influences the material of the objects in interaction identified as the source of the sounds. Second, in a learning experiment, users' performance with the Spinotron device was compared between a group of participants that were provided only with passive proprioceptive information, and for another group who were also presented with synthetic sound produced by the artifact. The results indicated that the Sound. when present, aided users in learning to control the device, whereas without the sound no learning was observed. Together, these results hold promise toward creating a foundation for the design of continuous sound that is intended to accompany control actions oil the part of users, and toward establishing a basis for experimental/quantitative evaluation methods and gathering basic knowledge about sensory-motor activity engaged in tangible sonic interactions.

TI  - Towards Passive Haptic Learning of Piano Songs
PY  - 2015
AB  - Passive Haptic Learning (PHL) enables users to acquire motor skills by receiving tactile stimulation while no perceived attention is given to learning. Initial work used gloves with embedded vibration motors to passively teach users how to play simple, one-handed, one-note-at-a-time piano melodies. In an effort to create a practical system for learning full piano pieces, we have developed a method of passively teaching two-handed chorded skills, initially focusing on Braille typing. Here, we extend this effort to piano and show that passive stimulation is more effective at teaching piano pieces when presented on both hands simultaneously as opposed to training the left hand and then the right, as is common in many active teaching methods. We also demonstrate that accompanying audio is not needed for passive learning of piano melodies, which allows mobile PHL gloves to be used in more everyday situations.

Clinicians who manage patients with shoulder pain and athletes at risk of developing shoulder pain need to have the skills to assess static and dynamic scapular positioning and dynamic control. Several methods for the assessment of scapular positioning are described in scientific literature. However, the majority uses expensive and specialised equipment (laboratory methods), making their use in clinical practice nearly impossible. On the basis of biometric and kinematic studies, guidelines for interpreting the observation of static and dynamic scapular positioning pattern in patients with shoulder pain are provided. At this point, clinicians can use reliable clinical tests for the assessment of both static and dynamic scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. However, this review also provides clinicians several possible pitfalls when performing clinical scapular evaluation. On the basis of its clinical relevance, its proven reliability, its relation to body length and its applicability in a clinical setting, this review recommends to assess the scapula both static (visual observation and acromial distance or Baylor/double square method for shoulder protraction) and semidynamic (visual observation and inclinometry for scapular upward rotation). In addition, when the patient demonstrates with shoulder impingement symptoms, the scapular repositioning test and scapular assistant test are recommended for relating the patients' symptoms to the position or movement of the scapula.

TI  - Towards a science of touch, part I: Chinese pulse diagnostics in early modern Europe
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper is about a pre-modern 'science of touch' - Chinese pulse diagnostics - which was the aspect of Chinese medicine most admired by physicians in early modern Europe. The paper first provides some historical information on Chinese pulse diagnostics in Europe and then details how it was presented to an 18th-century readership. At last, it points out that Chinese physicians had developed an elaborate system for distinguishing between various experiences of touch. From an outsider's viewpoint, one could say that they already had an idea of calibration and made measurements in respect of a calibrated condition. Since they put their fingertips on the wrist of their patients and actively palpated it, one can say that their 'science of touch' was developed in respect of 'active touch'. This in contrast to the 'science of touch' developed by psychophysicists of the modern West, who have been interested primarily in 'passive touch'.

TI  - Towards active exploration of static and dynamic scene geometry
PY  - 1994
AB  - In this paper we describe the use of a steerable camera and active vision system in the real-time recovery of trajectories of objects moving on a planar surface in the scene. The system first self-calibrates the transformation from camera platform joint angles to scene plane coordinates by active observation of static scene geometry which has been stored as a model. The transformation is encoded as a homography. When distracted by motion, the camera saccades to the object and subsequently tracks it, and the 2D Cartesian components of the motion trajectory are recovered within the scene plane.

TI  - Towards an ecological approach to visual anticipation for expert performance in sport
PY  - 2008
AB  - Comments on an article by John Van Der Kamp et al. (see record 2008-12895-002). By emphasising the role of movement control in perception, these authors seek to re-direct the focus of research on visual anticipation from passive to active perception. They argue in favour of a theoretically driven research programme that considers both processes of judgment for action and of movement control in the study of anticipation in sport. The author indicated that the occlusion paradigm served to evaluate players' judgments or predictions about what action best fits a game's demands. However, as the authors suggest, the findings emanating from this method are overgeneralized to any perceptive capability. In sum, the authors of the target paper take an important step towards a principled study of visual anticipation-in sport, especially because of their emphasis on both visual perception and visually-guided action.

TI  - Towards an understanding of gait control: brain activation during the anticipation, preparation and execution of foot movements
PY  - 2004
AB  - While a detailed understanding of brain activity with hand movements has developed, less is known about the functional anatomy of motor control for foot movements. Here we have used fMRI to define brain activity associated with unilateral foot extension and flexion, component movements of gait. We studied brain responses to visually cued active and passive movements and periods of either preparation (before active movement) or anticipation (before passive movement) with a pseudo-randomized block design. A mixed-effects (n = 12) contrast of the active movement condition vs. rest identified brain activation in regions including the medial wall of the primary sensorimotor cortex, consistent with expected somatotopy. Medial wall activation during passive movement vs. rest was less intense and localized to the same region. Frontal and association cortices were more active during preparation or anticipation periods than during the movements themselves. A contrast of preparation to move vs. active movement showed significant activation in the medial frontal and frontopolar gyri and the precuneus. Contrast of the anticipation of movement with the passive movement condition revealed activation in the dorsal premotor cortex and precuneus. Our study thus provides evidence for somatotopy in multiple functional regions in the motor control network. The anterior prefrontal activity is involved in the preparation for cued movement with distinct regions of the medial motor cortex (including SMA and CMA) preferentially involved in motor program planning and execution. This direct characterization of brain activation patterns associated with foot movements promises use of fMRI for the functional analysis of pathologies of gait. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work is motivated by the high energy demand required to generate the walking motion of existing walking machines. From the limit cycle of passive walking devices it seems obvious that a great amount of power can be saved using the passive motion for active control, too. In this work energy-efficient walking on level ground is achieved by combination of a model which is capable of passive walking on an inclined slope with some energy input from active control.

TI  - Towards collective circum-antarctic passive acoustic monitoring: The southern ocean hydrophone network (SOHN)
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Southern Ocean Research Partnership (SORP) is an international research program initiated within the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 2009 to promote collaborative cetacean research, develop nov el research techniques, and conduct non-lethal research on whales in the Southern Ocean (CHILDERHOUSE 2009). One of the original research projects of the SORP is the Blue and Fin Whale Acoustic Trends Project, which aims to implement a long term passive acoustic research program to examine trends in Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) and fin whale (B. physalus) abundance, distribution, and seasonal presence in the Southern Ocean through the use of a network of passive acoustic recorders: the Southern Ocean Hydrophone Network (SOHN). Networks of widely spaced passive acoustic recorders can provide insights in spatio-temporal patterns of the presence and properties of whale calls as well as the potential to monitor trends in Antarctic blue and fin whale abundance. The SOHN will consist of a network of autonomous underwater acoustic re cording stations surrounding the Antarctic continent with each site remaining active throughout the 10-year duration of the project. In addition to circum polar coverage, high priority will be given towards achieving simultaneous temporal coverage, especially in the early years of the project. While logis tical constraints may prevent uniform distribution of SOHN recording sites around the continent, the Acoustic Trends Working group (ATW) aims to have at least one recording site in each of the six IWC management areas (i.e., one per 60° longitudinal wedge). International collaboration and coordination are imperative to achieve the project goals due to the high cost of Antarctic research as well as the broad spatial and temporal scales over which the SOHN will span. Furthermore, standardization of data is paramount for accurate and efficient analysis and interpretation of SOHN data. To facilitate international participation in the SOHN, this document provides practical recommendations to guide and support passive acoustic data of project as well as technical and logistic information and recommendations regarding standardization of recording locations is provided here for a diverse collection in Antarctic waters. This whitepaper addresses a wide audience, ranging from scientists from different disciplines with access to instrumenttation and/or infrastructure to collect passive acoustic data in the Southern Ocean, to ship operators or other parties that can provide logistic support to make the SOHN a reality. Background information and an outline of the sci entific aims of project as well as technical and logistic information and re commendations regarding standardization of recording locations is provided here for a diverse audience coming from different backgrounds with widely differing levels of experience with the applications and use of passive acoustic instrumentation. By providing the information relevant for SOHN from the ground up, we aim that this document contributes to increase aware ness and participation by a broad range of partner nations and organizations in the SOHN and Acoustic Trends Projects.

TI  - Towards robust 3D skeleton tracking using data fusion from multiple depth sensors
PY  - 2018
AB  - Real-time full-body tracking in VR is important for providing realistic experiences, especially for applications such as training, education, and social VR. The Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor can provide skeleton data for a user in real-time, however, due to occlusion issues and front/back ambiguity errors, one Kinect is not always reliable enough for the correct capture of 360-degree movements. In this paper, we present work to provide robust, real-time tracking using multiple Kinect v2 cameras. An adaptive data fusion method is described that constructs a high-quality 3D skeleton which can be used to drive a VR avatar regardless of the user's orientation. We compare three different approaches to fusing the data from the three Kinects, and compare against ground truth using an OptiTrack system. A static pose and a dynamic movement were captured to compare errors of each joint using the three fusion algorithms. Our results show that an adaptive weighting adjustment fusion method for combining skeleton data from the three Kinects according to the current facing direction performed best in terms of joint error. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Towards tactile sensor-based exploration in robotic environment

We provide a framework for active robotic exploration strategy and discuss the role of tactile and force/torque sensors in the exploration of a robotic workcell. Further, we describe a number of techniques useful in processing tactile information acquired using passive as well as active sensing modes. Successful adaptation of touch in robotic manipulatory systems entails in both enhancing the tactile sensor technology, and developing techniques for efficient and accurate analysis of the tactile information. Concepts and algorithms developed in this paper are evaluated using a laboratory test bed which includes an industrial robot with a parallel jaw end-effector with dynamic feed-back from a 10 × 16 tactile sensor and a force/torque sensor. Results of the experimental studies show promise for the basic active exploration framework and various algorithmic modules constituting the exploration process.

TI  - Towards the Investigation of Unsteady Control Surface Aerodynamics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Fostering the application range of CFD methods towards the simulation of entire flight manoeuvres still is a challenging task. It needs to be ensured that the aerodynamic effects evolving from the deflection of a control surface are properly resolved and that their impact on the overall aerodynamics is accurately predicted. Focussing on control surfaces CFD methods have traditionally been applied to investigate the performance of high-lift systems during take-off and landing. In recent years the interest in applying CFD to questions arising from other control surfaces gradually increased. The performance of a vertical tail with deflected rudder in engine-out conditions, for instance, or the efficiency of ailerons and spoilers are nowadays often determined using CFD. All these applications, however, have in common that they address static control surface deflections only. To close the gap towards manoeuvre flight simulations it is therefore indispensable to take the dynamic motion of a control surface and their transient aerodynamic behaviour into account. \nSpoilers, for example, are well known to exhibit a strongly nonlinear aerodynamic behaviour with significant time lags. Depending on their deflection rate spoilers may even yield a short-term lift augmentation. The investigation of spoiler aerodynamics is therefore hardly possible with low-fidelity tools.\nA profound assessment of the transient aerodynamic behaviour of a dynamic spoiler therefore requires an experimental data base with which the higher-fidelity CFD simulations can be validated. As DLR was lacking a wind tunnel model offering these functionalities it was decided to modify the DLR-F15 model with a dynamic control surface.\nThe present paper highlights the constraints for the development of this new version of the DLR-F15 model and gives an overview on the background and the objective of the work planned.

TI  - Towards the improvement of automatic speech recognition by integrating dynamic and static auditory-based acoustic distinctive features and spectral cues
PY  - 2005
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the addition of the time derivatives of the auditory-based acoustic distinctive features and spectral cues to their static values for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Comparative experiments have indicated that combining the classical MFCCs with the instantaneous and the dynamic features of the speech signal represented by both the auditory-based acoustic distinctive cues and spectral cues using a multi-stream paradigm leads to an improvement in the recognition performance. To test the use of the new multi-stream feature vector, a series of experiments on speaker-independent continuous-speech recognition have been carried out using the TIMIT database. Using such paradigm, we found that the use of the proposed static and dynamic features combined with MFCCs, outperforms the conventional recognition process that uses only the MFCCs and their first and second derivatives.

TI  - Towards the investigation of unsteady spoiler aerodynamics
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aircraft configurations with deployed control surfaces are increasingly in the limelight of aerodynamic investigations using high-fidelity based Computational Fluid Dynamics to possibly reduce the conservatism in the design process. So far, most applications focus on static control surface deflections. To close the gap towards future simulations of entire flight maneuvers, including gust encounters, the dynamic motion of the control surfaces and their transient impact on the aircraft configuration need to be taken into account. Hence, extending the application range of its flow solver TAU is of strategic interest for the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). To support these numerical activities DLR developed a wind tunnel model with an active spoiler. In collaboration with German-Dutch Wind Tunnels, the aerodynamic performance of this model has been examined in two wind tunnel campaigns in 2016, focusing on static and dynamic spoiler deflections. The present paper gives an overview on the motivation of this work and highlights the experimental setup as well as exemplary results. The data will later be used to further validate the DLR flow solver TAU. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards the use of interactive simulation for effective e-learning in university classroom environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this PhD thesis, the utilisation of interactive simulation in a higher education e-learning classroom environment was explored and its effectiveness was experimentally evaluated by engaging university students in a classroom setting. Two case studies were carried out for the experimental evaluation of the proposed novel interactive simulation e-learning tool. In the first case study, the use of interactive agent-based simulation was demonstrated in teaching complex adaptive system concepts in the area of ecology to university students and its effectiveness was measured in a classroom environment. In a lab intervention using a novel interactive agent-based simulation (built in NetLogo). For the purpose of teaching complex adaptive systems such as the concept of spatially-explicit predator prey interaction to undergraduate and postgraduate students in the University of Stirling. The effectiveness of using the interactive simulation was investigated by using the NetLogo software and compared with non-interactive simulation built using R programming language. The experimental evaluation was carried out using a total of 38 students. Results of this case study demonstrates that the students found interactive agent-based simulation to be more engaging, effective and user friendly as compare to the non-interactive simulation. In the second case study, a novel interactive simulation game was developed (in NetLogo) and its effectiveness in teaching and learning of complex concepts in the field of marine ecology was demonstrated. This case study makes a twofold contribution. Firstly, the presentation of a novel interactive simulation game, developed specifically for use in undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the area of marine ecology. This novel interactive simulation game is designed to help learners to explore a mathematical model of fishery population growth and understand the principles for sustainable fisheries. Secondly, the comparison of two different methods of using the interactive simulation game within the classroom was investigated: learning from active exploration of the interactive simulation game compared with learning from an expert demonstration of the interactive simulation game. The case study demonstrated the effectiveness of learning from passive viewing of an expert demonstration of the interactive simulation game over learning from active exploration of the interactive simulation game without expert guidance, for teaching complex concepts sustainable fishery management. A mixed methods study design was used, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to compare the learning effectiveness of the two approaches, and the students’ preferences. The investigation was carried out by running interventions with a mixture of undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of Stirling in a classroom environment. A total of 74 participants were recruited from undergraduate and postgraduate level for both case studies. This thesis demonstrated through two case studies effectiveness of the proposed novel interactive simulation in university e-learning classroom environment.

TI  - Towed acoustic countermeasures for defending acoustic homing torpedoes
PY  - 2019
AB  - The growing torpedo threat to ships and submarines demands effective countermeasures for defence. Detection, classification and localisation of an attacking torpedo is the first step towards launching effective countermeasures. Studies are on the rise to use the existing sonar systems to detect torpedoes and subsequently use countermeasures. The use of towed array sonar systems for torpedo detection and acoustic counter measures are the most recent and not reported much in open literature. This paper presents a modular acoustic counter measure approach using towed decoy against acoustic homing torpedoes. Describes the technologies and algorithms required for different modes of towed decoy, which is effective against both active and passive acoustic homing torpedoes. Towed decoy signal generation schemes and their realisation using digital signal processing hardware are outlined in this paper. © 2019, DESIDOC

TI  - Tracking Recovery of Vestibular Function in Individuals With Blast-Induced Head Trauma Using Vestibular-Visual-Cognitive Interaction Tests
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background and Purpose: Traumatic brain injury secondary to blast exposure is a significant international concern and a growing rehabilitation issue. Our objective was to determine whether a novel battery of vestibular-visual-cognitive interaction tests provides objective data to document functioning, and the changes in functioning associated with vestibular physical therapy (VPT) treatment, in individuals with blast-induced balance disorder.Methods: Eighty-two individuals with blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury were evaluated at baseline using a set of vestibular-visual-cognitive tests. Testing was repeated at 4-week intervals after beginning VPT. The tests included static visual acuity, perception time, target acquisition, target following (TF), dynamic visual acuity (DVA), and gaze stabilization tests. The VPT program consisted of exercise procedures that targeted the vestibulo-ocular reflex, cervico-ocular reflex, and depth perception. Somatosensory balance exercises, dynamic gait, and aerobic function exercises were also included. Participants attended VPT twice weekly for 1-hour appointments and were instructed to perform the exercises at home on other days. Mean test values were determined and compared with normative values previously collected in our laboratory from individuals without vestibular dysfunction.Results: Mean participant pre-VPT measures for perception time and target acquisition were similar to normative values, and there was no significant change in these measures. Initially, TF and DVA scores were below normative levels but returned to normative levels after 8 weeks of VPT. Gaze stabilization scores were below normative levels pre-VPT but improved by the time of the week 8 evaluation.Conclusions: This battery of vestibular-visual-cognitive tests seems to be reasonable to establish initial status and to evaluate participant progress associated with participation in VPT. Our data suggest meaningful improvement in TF and DVA after 8 weeks of treatment. A treatment period of 12 weeks or longer may be required for gaze stabilization scores to return to normative values.

TI  - Tracking Technologies for Quantifying Marine Mammal Interactions with Tidal Turbines: Pitfalls and Possibilities
PY  - 2014
AB  - Currently, there is great uncertainty surrounding the environmental impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals; one major concern derives from the potential for physical injury through direct contact with the moving structures of turbines. Collecting data to quantify these risks is challenging and methods for measuring movements underwater and interactions with turbines are limited. However, potential tools include a small number of cutting-edge technologies that are being used increasingly for research and monitoring; these include animal-borne telemetry, and active and passive acoustic tracking. Recent developments in these technologies are described along with their means of application in measuring fine-scale movements and avoidance or evasion responses by marine mammals around turbines. From a risk-characterization perspective, each technique can provide information to inform risk assessments or help parametrize collision risk models; however, each has its associated benefits and drawbacks and it is clear that, in isolation, none of them can provide all the data needed to address the problem. The three approaches appear highly complementary, with the strengths of one complementing the weaknesses in others; the solution to characterizing the risks posed by tidal turbines is likely to be a combination of such techniques.

TI  - Tracking a moving acoustic source in a three-dimensional space
PY  - 1997
AB  - One of the most challenging tracking applications is to monitor the precise underwater movements of echo-locating cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises and whales) in the vicinity of a large pelagic trawl, i.e. in a moving frame of reference. The aim of the research is to provide information that may lead to a reduction in the by-catch of these animals. For example, by observing a dolphin as it approaches the trawl it may be possible to determine if or at what range it becomes aware of various deterrents, such as the trawl itself, or attached passive sonar reflectors and active acoustic pingers or transponders. To produce a valid estimate of a dolphin's instantaneous position, the tracking algorithm must determine the arrival times of the same echo-location click at all the hydrophones. The maximum spread of these arrival times is dependent only on the positioning of the hydrophones and the sound speed in water. The practical arrangement on the net comprises two parallel streamers, each with two hydrophones, all four therefore being in the same plane, and a fifth hydrophone above the trawl headline out of this plane.

TI  - Tracking change in word meaning. A dynamic visualization of diachronic distributional semantics
PY  - 20130313
AB  - Within Computational Linguistics, distributional models of semantics have become the mainstay of large-scale modeling of lexical semantics (see Turney and Pantel 2010 for an overview). Distributional modeling also hold a large potential for research in Linguistics proper: It allow linguists to base their analysis on large amounts of usage data, thus vastly extending their empirical basis, AND they make it possible to detect potentially interesting semantic patterns. However, so far, there have been relatively few applications, mainly because of the technical complexity and the lack of a linguist-friendly interface to explore the output. To address this issue, Heylen et al. (2012) proposed an interactive visualization of a distributional similarity matrix based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling for synchronic data. In this paper, we extend this approach to diachronic data and propose a dynamic visualization of distributional semantic change through motion charts. As a case study, we look at the meaning changes that 17 positive evaluative adjectives have undergone in the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA, Davies 2012) between 1860 and 2000. Visualization of diachronic distributional data has been proposed previously by a.o. Rohrdantz et al. (2011) but these representations were static. In this paper, we use a dynamic visualization of linguistic change, first proposed by Hilpert (2011) for manually coded data sets, and extend here to the large-scale, unsupervised distributional models. For a set of adjectives that express positive evaluation (a.o. brilliant, magnificent, fantastic, terrific, superb). We investigate how they carve up this semantic space and how this changes over time. From COHA, we extracted a word-by-context co-occurrence vector using a window of 4 left and right for each adjective in each of the 14 decades between 1860 and 2000. Next, we calculated the cosine similarity between all adjective/decade vectors and used non-parametric MDS to represent these similarities in 2 dimensions. The MDS solution with adjective and decade information was then visualized with the R-package googleVis, an interface between R and the Google Visualization API. The resulting, dynamic motion chart is available online under https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0038536/magnificent/Magnificent3D.html. The chart shows adjectives as clickable bubbles with a time slider to move between decades. 'Playing' the chart shows dynamically how the semantic distances between the adjectives changes over time. In the center, adjectives like splendid, magnificent or great represent the core of the concept and they remain relatively stable over time. However, figure 1 shows that terrific was in 1860 still quite far removed from the center, probably because it was still predominantly used in its literal sense of FRIGHTENING. Only around 1950, terrific starts to move to the core and acquires its positive evaluative meaning. Since, distributional models are a completely automatic technique with a multitude of possible parameter settings, this particular solution is probably not yet optimal. An important next step is therefore the evaluation of the automatically induced patterns against a manually coded and interpreted dataset.

TI  - Tracking from a moving platform with the Dynamic Vision Sensor
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is an imaging sensor that processes the incident irradiance image and outputs temporal log irradiance changes in the image, such as those generated by moving target(s) and/or the moving sensor platform. From a static platform, this enables the DVS to cancel out background clutter and greatly decrease the sensor bandwidth required to track temporal changes in a scene. However, the sensor bandwidth advantage is lost when imaging a scene from a moving platform due to platform motion causing optical flow in the background. Imaging from a moving platform has been utilized in many recently reported applications of this sensor. However, this approach inherently outputs background clutter generated from optical flow, and as such this approach has limited spatio-temporal resolution and is of limited utility for target tracking applications. In this work we present a new approach to moving target tracking applications with the DVS. Essentially, we propose modifying the incident image to cancel out optical flow due to platform motion, thereby removing background clutter and recovering the bandwidth performance advantage of the DVS. We propose that such improved performance can be accomplished by integrating a hardware tracking and stabilization subsystem with the DVS. Representative simulation scenarios are used to quantify the performance of the proposed approach to clutter cancellation and improved sensor bandwidth.

TI  - Tracking objects with eye movements
PY  - 1989
AB  - The author's goal is to promote animate vision-that is, active vision for the purpose of guiding behavior. Ballard (1987, 1988) argues that taking this view of the goal of the vision system not only changes the nature of the problems that are tackled by the system, but also provides novel means for their solution. The goal is to achieve interesting visually guided behavior, rather than to build an internal representation of the world. When having such an internal model is useful or necessary, then it should be constructed as a means of obtaining the desired behavior, but it is not a primary interest. This may permit the solution of many simplified problems, rather than the more general and usually ill-posed problems that have been attempted by the traditional passive vision approach. Furthermore, the possession of an animate vision system provides new tools and abilities with which to attack these problems. For instance, it has been suggested that disparity from vergence may be utilized to distinguish a target to be tracked from the background by keeping the eyes verged upon it. The preliminary work on gaze control presented in the paper is based on this idea

TI  - Tracking sea turtle hatchlings - A pilot study using acoustic telemetry
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding the movements of turtle hatchings is essential for improved understanding of dispersal behaviour and ultimately survivorship, life history strategies and population connectivity. Yet investigation of in-water movement has been hampered by the small size of hatchlings relative to the size of available tracking technologies. This has resulted in the use of labour intensive visual tracking methods, or active tracking methods with high transmitter to body weight ratios. These methods are confounded by the presence of the observer, the size of the tag, usual small treatment sample sizes and studies that are constrained to daylight hours when turtles hatch predominantly at night. Passive acoustic monitoring using new miniature tags can overcome these limitations.We tested the effectiveness of active and passive acoustic tracking in monitoring turtle hatchling movement in order to measure the influence of artificial light on newly hatched turtles once they enter the water. A Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) comprising an array of 18 VR2W receivers was deployed in the surf zone to detect signals from acoustic-coded transmitters (1.14 +/- 0.06% of body mass) attached to 26 flatback turtle hatchlings released into the array. A total of 1328 detections were recorded for 22 hatchlings with turtles spending a mean of 16.63 +/- 5.89 min in the array. The test detection range for this technology in the surf-zone was 50-100 m and was influenced by wave noise and shallow deployment. Cyclonic conditions hampered the experiment and resulted in an inconclusive test of light effects. Three additional instrumented flatback hatchlings were followed in a small boat using a mobile acoustic receiver and directional hydrophone up to 2 km from shore. Passive acoustic monitoring is a viable technology for tracking small marine animals and removes many of the confounding effects of other telemetry methods. It has great potential to examine natural and anthropogenic factors influencing orientation and behaviour during a crucial stage in turtle life history their initial movement from the beach through predator-rich, near shore waters. While the data obtained by passive acoustic monitoring is limited in its spatio-temporal coverage, being constrained by the size of the array, active acoustic tracking can be applied over larger scales. Such studies will be particularly important for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic pressures that have changed the natural light, noise or wave environments and for providing behavioural data to improve and validate bio-physical models of the migration and dispersal of young turtles.

TI  - Tracking sperm whales with a towed acoustic vector sensor
PY  - 2010
AB  - Passive acoustic towed linear arrays are increasingly used to detect marine mammal sounds during mobile anthropogenic activities. However, these arrays cannot resolve between signals arriving from the port or starboard without vessel course changes or multiple cable deployments, and their performance is degraded by vessel self-noise and non-acoustic mechanical vibration. In principle acoustic vector sensors can resolve these directional ambiguities, as well as flag the presence of non-acoustic contamination, provided that the vibration-sensitive sensors can be successfully integrated into compact tow modules. Here a vector sensor module attached to the end of a 800 m towed array is used to detect and localize 1813 sperm whale "clicks" off the coast of Sitka, AK. Three methods were used to identify frequency regimes relatively free of non-acoustic noise contamination, and then the active intensity (propagating energy) of the signal was computed between 4-10 kHz along three orthogonal directions, providing unambiguous bearing estimates of two sperm whales over time. These bearing estimates are consistent with those obtained via conventional methods, but the standard deviations of the vector sensor bearing estimates are twice those of the conventionally-derived bearings. The resolved ambiguities of the bearings deduced from vessel course changes match the vector sensor predictions. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3495945]

TI  - Tracking within-category colors is easier: Color categories modulate location processing in a dynamic visual task
PY  - 2020
AB  - The categorical perception (CP) of color describes the phenomenon that colors across categories (e.g., blue and green) are more discriminable than within-category colors (e.g., green) even when the perceptual distance is controlled. While most studies are conducted in a static visual scene, the current study investigated the effect of color categories when tracking multiple colored objects within two experiments. The targets or distractors were either from the same color category or from two different categories, and the perceptual distance was controlled across all conditions. We found that location tracking was facilitated when the targets or the distractors shared the same color category in the tracking task, which required location tracking and color memorization at the same time, compared with when they were from two different categories (Experiment 1). By contrast, when location tracking was the sole demand and no explicit color processing was required, the target CP effects, but not the distractor CP effects, persisted (Experiment 2). We conclude that color categories can dynamically modulate preattention visual processing when color working memory is involved, but that attention is necessary to produce CP effects when color is irrelevant to the task. © 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

TI  - Traction Analysis for Active-caster Omnidirectional Robotic Drive with a Ball Transmission (ACROBAT)
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper presents a traction analysis for the Active-Caster omnidirectional RObotic drive with a BAll Transmission (ACROBAT). The original Active-Caster omnidirectional RObotic drive (ACRO) allows one to design a holonomic and omnidirectional mobile robot without using so-called omni-wheels such as Mechanum wheel or Universal wheel, etc. The ACRO equips with two motors to generate 2DOF active motion by coordinating two motors based on an angle sensor to detect the wheel orientation. ACROBAT has been developed to remove the needs for an absolute encoder for detecting the wheel orientation and complexities on the coordinated motor control for a robot with ACRO system. ACROBAT needs ball transmission to compose propelling power from two motors and distribute it to wheel axis and steering axis mechanically in an appropriate ratio. To realize this functionality, a drive torque has to be transmitted certainly by traction drive with no slip via the contact point between rollers to a ball and a ball to a ball. Therefore, transmitted torque and a required load to the contact point has to be analyzed to design and maintain a reliability of the mechanism. For the purpose, a traction force analysis is performed in this paper. To transmit motor rated torque to drive the wheel and the steering of the mechanism, the maximum traction force at each contact point is derived from a static model of the mechanism. To guaranty the transmittable traction force, contact loads applied to the components such as rollers or balls are derived as well. To satisfy the required contact loads, the individual load control mechanism has been designed in the first prototype. To meet the required contact load, the loading mechanism is modified from the first one. By the modification, the second prototype is able to be driven by two motors to realize 2DOF motion of the wheel mechanism which shows a holonomic and omnidirectional motion without angle sensor or a high coordinated motor control system.

TI  - Traditional theories and the development of motion acupuncture: A historical perspective
PY  - 2015
AB  - Muscle soreness is a common response to exercise after unaccustomed workouts or sports activities. Additional causes of muscle soreness include tension, stress and minor injuries to tissues within and around muscles. Motion Acupuncture, a specialized technique of acupuncture incorporating both traditional acupuncture, western biomedicine, and physical movements, has demonstrated excellent efficacy for decreasing musculoskeletal pain, improving musculoskeletal function, and treating non-musculoskeletal symptoms. The sinew in Motion Acupuncture refers to muscle and fascia, especially skeletal muscles and their associated connective tissue. The so-called 'motion' refers to active range of motions initiated and controlled by muscle, fascia, joints and ligaments. Abnormalities in meridian sinews create abnormal transverse collaterals and nodules of sinews which have the same meaning as tender or trigger points. With Motion Acupuncture, tension over the painful areas will be released and thus the limited range of motion will return normal. Techniques of Motion Acupuncture involve muscle contraction and stretching exercises during acupuncture at the affected areas. Dr. Decheng Chen, founder of Motion Acupuncture, created Motion Acupuncture which greatly enhanced the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in motion. Understandings of Motion Acupuncture are well supported by both traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern biomedical research. Motion Acupuncture features 'selecting the tender point and nodule as the acupoint for needle insertion'. In Motion Acupuncture, acupuncture manipulation features regular acupuncture needles, special techniques and targeted therapy; motion styles include independent active motion supplemented with passive motion, based on patients' tolerance.

TI  - Trager® psychophysical integration - An overview
PY  - 2003
AB  - The following article is an overview of the Trager Approach from the perspective of an experienced practitioner. The main themes include: the passive movement in the tablework, active movement in Mentastics®, the mental state of the practitioner - 'hook-up,' anchoring the client's awareness in feeling sensation, and the perception that physical change depends upon a change of mind. Milton Trager influenced a number of bodywork and lay practitioners with his infectious presence and energetic role modeling. When he finally started teaching his work to others he was already in his late 60s. Most of his students were quite a bit younger than him and did not fully realize the connection he provided to an earlier time. His emphasis on physical movement and 'agelessness' reflected the influences of the physical culturists of the early 20th century. The real genius of his work was his realization that gentle, rhythmical movement, performed with great sensitivity, could affect positive and long-term changes in the client. The principles he discovered in refining his work seem almost zen-like in application. The stronger the resistance in the client, the less the amplitude of movement imposed by the practitioner. Soft hands, supported by movement that is generated from the practitioner's whole body are more subtle and effective. The most powerful shifts often happen when the practitioner breaks physical contact giving the client space to integrate what has just been experienced. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The trailing vortex induced aerodynamic loads on a Falcon 20G business jet flying in the wake of a DC-8 are predicted to provide a preflight estimate of safe trail distances during flight test measurements in the wake. Static and dynamic loads on the airframe flying in the near wake are shown at a matrix of locations, and the dynamic motion of the Falcon 20G during traverses of the DC-8 primary trailing vortex is simulated. Safe trailing distances for the test flights are determined, and optimum vortex traverse schemes are identified to moderate the motion of the trailing aircraft during close encounters with the vortex wake.

TI  - Trainability of Core Stiffness : Studies of Core Training Methods on Naive and Savvy Populations
PY  - 2013
AB  - Core exercise is a staple of many physical training regimens with goals ranging from improving athletic performance to rehabilitation of spine and knee injuries. Traditionally, dynamic movements such as flexion, lateral bending and twisting core exercise maneuvers are used in training programs; an approach consistent with training the distal limbs where muscular effort is mostly devoted to creating motion. However, knowledge of the functional anatomy of core musculature and spine injury mechanisms questions the use of these types of exercises. Alternative core exercises make use of isometric postures and static bracing to create muscular activation while minimizing spine loads and injury mechanisms linked with movement. This study aims to quantify the effect of various core training programs on the change of passive and active stiffness properties of the torso.

TI  - Training children aged 5-10 years in manual compliance control to improve drawing and handwriting
PY  - 2019
AB  - A large proportion of school-aged children exhibit poor drawing and handwriting. This prevalence limits the availability of therapy. We developed an automated method for training improved manual compliance control and relatedly, prospective control of a stylus. The approach included a difficult training task, while providing parametrically modifiable support that enables the children to perform successfully while developing good compliance control. The task was to use a stylus to push a bead along a 3D wire path. Support was provided by making the wire magnetically attractive to the stylus. Support was progressively reduced as 3D tracing performance improved. We report studies that (1) compared performance of Typically Developing (TD) children and children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), (2) tested training with active versus passive movement, (3) tested progressively reduced versus constant or no support during training, (4) tested children of different ages, (5) tested the transfer of training to a drawing task, (6) tested the specificity of training in respect to the size, shape and dimensionality of figures, and (7) investigated the relevance of the training task to the Beery VMI, an inventory used to diagnose DCD. The findings were as follows. (1) Pre-training performance of TD and DCD children was the same and good with high support but distinct and poor with low support. Support yielded good self-efficacy that motivated training. Post training performance with no support was improved and the same for TD and DCD children. (2) Actively controlled movements were required for improved performance. (3) Progressively reduced support was required for good performance during and after training. (4) Age differences in performance during pretraining were eliminated post-training. (5) Improvements transferred to drawing. (6) There was no evidence of specificity of training in transfer. (7) Disparate Beery scores were reflected in pre-training but not post-training performance. We conclude that the method improves manual compliance control, and more generally, prospective control of movements used in drawing performance.

TI  - Training the Unimpaired Arm Improves the Motion of the Impaired Arm and the Sitting Balance in Chronic Stroke Survivors
PY  - 2017
AB  - Robot-assisted rehabilitation of stroke survivors mainly focuses on the impaired side of the body while the role of the unimpaired side in the recovery after stroke is still controversial. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence on sitting balance and paretic arm functions of a training protocol based on movements of the unimpaired arm. Sixteen chronic stroke survivors underwent nineteen training sessions, in which they performed active movements with the unimpaired arm supported by a passive exoskeleton. Performance of the trunk and upper limbs was evaluated before treatment, after treatment and at sixmonths follow up with clinical scales and an instrumented evaluation. A reaching test executed with the exoskeleton was used to assess changes in performance of both arms. The treatment based on the unimpaired arm's movements executedwith a correct body posture led to benefits in control of the trunk and of both the trained and the untrained arm. The amount of impaired arm improvement in the Fugl-Meyer score was comparable to the outcome of robotic treatments focused directly on this arm. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account all body schema in the rehabilitation robotic program, instead of focusing only on the impaired side of the body.

TI  - Trajectory Adaptation and Learning for Ankle Rehabilitation Using a 3-PRS Parallel Robot
PY  - 2015
AB  - This paper presents a methodology for learning and adaptation of a 3-PRS parallel robot skills for ankle rehabilitation. Passive exercises have been designed to train dorsi/plantar flexion, inversion/eversion ankle movements. During exercises, forces may be high because patient cannot follow the desired trajectory. While small errors in the desired trajectory can cause important deviations in the desired forces, pure position control is inappropriate for tasks that require physical contact with the environment. The proposed algorithm takes as input the reference trajectory and force profile, then adapts the robot movement by introducing small offsets to the reference trajectory so that the resulting forces exerted by the patient match the reference profile. The learning procedure is based on Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs).

TI  - Trajectory Modeling for Robust Speech Recognition
PY  - 2012
AB  - Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is widely used to represent acoustic units in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One of the major limitations of HMM is the conditional independence assumption of the observation vector given its state. This leads to a poor trajectory model. Although many explicit trajectory modeling techniques have been proposed and studied in the past, the use of dynamic parameters remains the most popular way to circumvent the problem. Recently, advanced trajectory modeling techniques have been used to improve the acoustic models and noise robustness for ASR.Semi-parametric trajectory models have been proposed to implicitly model the trajectory using temporally varying model parameters. These parameters are modeled using a linear regression of some basis structures with temporally varying regression weights. Initial work has focused on modeling the temporally varying mean (fMPE) and precision matrices (pMPE). Temporally Varying Weight Regression (TVWR) has also been proposed to model the component weights of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). As a result, TVWR is able to model non-stationary distribution within the HMM states, yielding an implicit trajectory model.Trajectory HMM has also been proposed to reformulate the conventional HMM by taking into consideration the explicit relationship between the static and dynamic acoustic features. Trajectory HMM is a generative model that is capable of producing smooth acoustic feature sequence, making it a popular choice for speech synthesis. However, trajectory HMM can only be used for N-best re-scoring in speech recognition tasks.Nevertheless, trajectory HMM has been recently applied to model-based noise compensation to improve the robustness of ASR in noisy environment. Traditionally, Parallel Model Combination (PMC) is used to synthesize noisy speech models given the clean speech and noise models. However, PMC cannot be easily applied to compensate the dynamic parameters. Therefore, trajectory HMM formulation was incorporated into PMC to yield a unified compensation for both static and dynamic parameters. This leads to a novel technique called Trajectory-based PMC (TPMC). This method has been found to outperform both PMC and Vector Taylor Series (VTS) methods.This tutorial aims to give an introduction to trajectory modeling for HMM-based speech recognition. This tutorial consists of two main parts. The first part of the tutorial will describe several semi-parametric trajectory models for speech recognition including fMPE, pMPE and TVWR. The second part of the tutorial will cover several model-based approaches to noise robust speech recognition including PMC, VTS and TPMC.

TI  - Trajectory analysis by a crayfish proprioceptor: Receptor muscle activity may determine a velocity reference point
PY  - 1982
AB  - The myochordotonal organ, spanning the merus-carpus joint consists of a receptor muscle called the accessory flexor which is closely associated with sensory neurons. These neurons are attached to a connective tissue strap which stretches between a portion of the accessory flexor and the adjacent cuticle of the meropodite. The activity of this proprioceptor was examined during both passive and spontaneous flexions of the merus-carpus joint as well as under conditions of inertial loading and de-efferentation of the receptor muscle. During passively imposed movements, the sensory neurons discharge closely in proportion to joint velocity. However in self-generated movements the velocity sensitivity of these neurons changes greatly and may even reverse. We suggest that these changes in velocity sensitivity may be explained in terms of a previously undescribed property of proprioceptors which have an efferent input. We have called this property the reference trajectory of the proprioceptor. We have defined reference velocity trajectory as the time series of stimulus velocities at which the proprioceptor's discharge is minimal. In passive receptors this sequence would not change in time. In the case of the myochordotonal organ, however, the stimulus velocities at which the receptor output is minimal changes when there is motor activity in the receptor muscle. Immediately prior to a spontaneous flexion, the reference velocity trajectory of the myochordotonal organ rises from 0/s to 20-40/s. During the movement the trajectory normally stays at this level falling back to zero only after the movement is stopped. Our data suggest that during spontaneous flexion the myochordotonal organ encodes the direction as well as the magnitude of the deviations of actual joint velocity from its reference velocity trajectory. The sensing of this difference is referred to as trajectory analysis. A mechanism of trajectory analysis is proposed in terms of the changes in forces which occur in the receptor muscle during a spontaneous movement. © 1982.

TI  - Trajectory planning of autonomous robot Using advanced fuzzy controller
PY  - 2010
AB  - To move a obstacle from a certain position to the predefined destination, robot needs various kinds of elements, like control algorithm, hardware, etc. General human can selects the distance between him and destination by numerical supervised learning, and establish the moving plan to the destination, generally called 'Trajectory planning.' He(or she) can make a trajectory planning against the obstacles which is placed on the path to the destination. The kinds of obstacle can be active obstacle, which is moving on the trajectory, or passive obstacle, which is stationary one. For the kinds of stationary obstacle is height difference between road and sidewalk, stairs, a ramp. And the active obstacles include a human, a vehicle that shows active motion. To make a trajectory planning for the stationary obstacle, autonomous mobile robot can be assume that it is placed at the center of the map, and from the distance information between autonomous mobile robot and obstacles using the advanced fuzzy controller, mobile robot can make a trajectory planning. But in case of active moving obstacle, there are many components and information is needed to process because its moving trace should be considered in real time. As mentioned above, for the proposed algorithm, various kinds of things should be considered to move to the destination. Obviously, autonomous driving of the mobile robot can provide conveniences to the human-being with the various kinds of aspects. In this paper, obstacle avoidance algorithm for the trajectory planning using advanced fuzzy controller is described in detail, and demonstrated proposed algorithm through the real experiment. ©2010 IEEE.

TI  - Transcending Convention and Space: Strategies for Fostering Active Learning in Large Post-Secondary Classes
PY  - 2014
AB  - In 1970, education theorist Paulo Freire (1970) sharply critiqued dominant pedagogy--or what he called the banking model of education--for stripping students of their agency. In the banking model, he wrote, instructors are empowered as narrating subjects as students who become alienated as passive listening objects. In the decades since, research has repeatedly shown that a banking model of education is ineffective and inefficient. Despite this, there is an increasing trend towards large, lecture-based learning in post-secondary classrooms, fuelled largely by the turn to a neoliberal, corporatized model for higher education. Active learning pedagogy moves away from the banking model of education, toward a model that positions the student as an active participant in his or her own learning and development. While active learning has been shown to be more effective, large class sizes, classroom structures, teaching loads, and diminishing teaching resources can make it difficult for instructors to integrate active learning into large post-secondary lecture-halls. This paper explores the challenge of inspiring active learning in large classes and proposes a number of strategies for integrating active learning in large university lecture halls.

TI  - Transcortical reflexes and servo control of movement
PY  - 1981
AB  - Sherrington proposed that the major role of proprioceptors is in processing afferent inputs generated by the active movements of the animal itself, and noted that the reflex effects of proprioceptive inputs are 'mild'. Current experimental results are consistent with the view that the major role of both segmental and transcortical proprioceptive reflexes is in small active movements and active postural stability, with muscle afferent inputs reducing '...errors of muscle length produced by fluctuating levels of motor discharge...' as stated by Goodwin and coworkers in 1978. Exteroceptive reflexes generate intense muscular responses and are of critical importance in prompt reprogramming essential for effective responses to environmental stimuli. Within the motor cortex (MI) there is a caudal region (MI/c) which receives exteroceptive cutaneous inputs and a rostral region (MI/r) which receives proprioceptive inputs. Transcortical reflexes mediated via pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) of MI/r have properties which are analogous to segmental proprioceptive reflexes: changes of muscle length elicit PTN discharges which oppose the length change and so act to maintain stability. Furthermore, MI/r PTNs which are recruited earliest for small active movements are most sensitive to proprioceptive inputs. Data are not yet available concerning transcortical reflexes via MI/c during voluntary movement, but it is speculated that the cutaneous reflexes via MI/c might be functionally analogous to segmental cutaneous reflexes. Short-latency reflex responses also occur in postcentral (PoC) PTNs, and in this report we present results concerning the properties of PoC PTNs during active and passive movement. Caudal (area 2-5) PoC PTNs were similar to MI PTNs in that they often discharged prior to electromyogram (EMG) activity with active movement, and had different discharge frequencies with different steady state loads, but were unlike most MI PTNs in having the same changes of discharge with active and passive movement. Our finding of PoC discharge prior to movement onset, confirming that of Soso and Fetz in 1980, is discussed in connection with the concept of corollary discharge.

TI  - Transcranial Assessment and Visualization of Acoustic Cavitation: Modeling and Experimental Validation
PY  - 2015
AB  - The interaction of ultrasonically-controlled microbubble oscillations with tissues and biological media has been shown to induce a wide range of bioeffects that may have significant impact on therapy and diagnosis of brain diseases and disorders. However, the inherently non-linear microbubble oscillations combined with the micrometer and microsecond scales involved in these interactions and the limited methods to assess and visualize them transcranially hinder both their optimal use and translation to the clinics. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework that combines numerical simulations with multimodality imaging to assess and visualize the microbubble oscillations transcranially. In the present work, microbubble oscillations were studied with an integrated US and MR imaging guided clinical FUS system. A high-resolution brain CT scan was also co-registered to the US and MR images and the derived acoustic properties were used as inputs to two-and three-dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain simulations that matched the experimental conditions and geometry. Synthetic point sources by either a Gaussian function or the output of a microbubble dynamics model were numerically excited and propagated through the skull towards a virtual US imaging array. Using passive acoustic mapping (PAM) that was refined to incorporate variable speed of sound, we were able to correct the aberrations introduced by the skull and substantially improve the PAM resolution. The good agreement between the simulations incorporating microbubble emissions and experimentally-determined PAMs suggest that this integrated approach can provide a clinically-relevant framework and more control over this non-linear and dynamic process.

TI  - Transcytosis of Nanomedicine for Tumor Penetration
PY  - 2019
AB  - The diffusion of nanomedicines used to treat tumors is severely hindered by the microenvironment, which is a challenge that has emerged as a bottleneck for the effective outcome of nanotherapies. Classical strategies for enhancing tumor penetration rely on passive movement in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we demonstrate that nanomedicine also penetrates tumor lesions via an active trans-cell transportation process. This process was discovered by directly observing the movement of nanoparticles between cells, evaluating the intracellular trafficking pathway of nanoparticles via Rab protein labeling, comparing endocytosis-exocytosis between nanoparticles administered with inhibitors, and correlating the transcytosis process with the micro-CT distribution of nanomedicines. We also demonstrated that enhanced tumor penetration promotes the therapeutic efficacy of a photodynamic therapeutic nanomedicine. Our research thus suggests that transcytosis could be an important positive factor for designing cancer nanomedicines. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Transfer of the curvature aftereffect in dynamic touch
PY  - 2008
AB  - A haptic curvature aftereffect is a phenomenon in which the perception of a curved shape is systematically altered by previous contact to Curvature. In the present study, the existence and intermanual transfer of curvature aftereffects for dynamic touch were investigated. Dynamic touch is characterized by motion contact between a finger and a stimulus. A distinction was made between active and passive contact of the finger on the stimulus surface. We demonstrated the occurrence of a dynamic curvature aftereffect and found a complete intermanual transfer of this aftereffect, which suggests that dynamically obtained curvature information is represented at a high level. In contrast, statically perceived curvature information is mainly processed at a level that is connected to a single hand, as previous studies indicated. Similar transfer effects were found for active and passive dynamic touch, but a stronger aftereffect was obtained when the test surface was actively touched. We conclude that the representation of object information depends on the exploration mode that is used to acquire information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transient Dynamic Analysis of Gait Motion Based on Two Unilateral External Fixators
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conference Title: 2019 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacturing (AIAM) Conference Start Date: 2019, Oct. 16 Conference End Date: 2019, Oct. 18 Conference Location: Dublin, Ireland Unilateral external fixators are commonly used to stabilize the fractured tibia bone. Compared to static fixation, axial dynamization has been shown in previous studies to promote callus formation, improve bone healing at fracture sites, and non-axial movements are not conductive to the bone healing and remodeling. In the later stage of fracture correction, patients can bear a certain load and can realize walking and other movements. Gait motion is the active axial dynamic motion. However, it is still unknown how the displacement change at the fracture site during gait movement motion. So the aim of this study is to use transient dynamic finite element method to simulate the actual walking gait process of the human body based on two unilateral fixators. The results reveal that compared Dyna-extor fixator, the Orthofix fixator has a better stability and flexibility during active dynamization motion. This study helps clinicians to plan and execute to training patients, meanwhile facilitates appro priate application of fixators to achieve either active or controlled axial dynamic movement, so that the orthopedist has a better understanding of the biomechanical environment at the fracture site.

TI  - Translation and the resolution of the pluton space problem
PY  - 1999
AB  - The Late Cretaceous Mono Creek granite has a pronounced NW-SE elongate shape, 60 km long by 10 km wide, characteristic of plutons from the eastern Sierra Nevada batholith. An 8 km-wide bulge exists on the NE side of this pluton, which exhibits evidence of forceful emplacement tor in-situ ballooning), such as deflection of metamorphic wallrock and igneous foliation, and the orientation of fracture patterns. Three-dimensional strain analysis indicates that wallrock strains do not provide enough volume to accommodate the emplacement of the bulge, a recurring problem in studies of plutonic terranes. We suggest that emplacement of the Mono Creek bulge was accommodated by all components of the three-dimensional displacement field-including translation, rotation, and pure strain (shape change)-of the surrounding units. Classical strain analysis only addresses the rotation and pure strain components, and is incapable of quantifying the translation component. However, our analysis suggests that translation plays the dominant role in the emplacement process. A shell model of translation of the surrounding igneous and metamorphic units is proposed for the Mono Creek bulge, which suggests that the translation component decreases dramatically away from the intrusion, consistent with the observed geology and finite strain analysis. We propose that translation is the solution to the recurring pluton 'space' problem, either through tectonically controlled (passive) or magmatically controlled (active) movement of the wallrocks. Translation is generally the neglected component of the displacement field, but it may often be evaluated through judicious use of finite strain analysis and tectonic reconstruction.

TI  - Transmission Dynamics and Control Mechanisms of Vector-Borne Diseases with Active and Passive Movements Between Urban and Satellite Cities
PY  - 2019
AB  - A metapopulation model which explicitly integrates vector-borne and sexual transmission of an epidemic disease with passive and active movements between an urban city and a satellite city is formulated and analysed. The basic reproduction number of the disease is explicitly determined as a combination of sexual and vector-borne transmission parameters. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the disease is primarily transmitted via the vector-borne mode, rather than via sexual transmission, and that sexual transmission by itself may not initiate or sustain an outbreak. Also, increasing the population movements from one city to the other leads to an increase in the basic reproduction number of the later city but a decrease in the basic reproduction number of the former city. The influence of other significant parameters is also investigated via the analysis of suitable partial rank correlation coefficients. After gauging the effects of mobility, we explore the potential effects of optimal control strategies relying upon several distinct restrictions on population movement. © 2019, Society for Mathematical Biology.

TI  - Transmission loss model of a wind tunnel with hybrid active-passive acoustic treatment
PY  - 2005
AB  - Acoustic measurements in wind tunnels commonly suffer from low SNR due to high levels of noise produced by the air flow in its interactions with the different elements of the tunnel. Passive acoustic treatments are frequently applied to the walls of wind tunnels in order to reduce this undesired noise. The use of active absorption mechanisms in conjunction with the passive treatments may improve the noise absorption in these systems. This work presents an analytical model for predicting the theoretical absorption achievable with this hybrid absorber, using both the Pressure Release and the Impedance Matching conditions for the active absorption. The parameters of the tunnel are those of the Virginia Tech Six Foot Stability Wind Tunnel.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective Reconstruction of the extensor mechanism of the knee joint by stable suture of the quadriceps tendon. Early functional treatment.Indications Acute or partial disruption of the quadriceps tendon close to the proximal patella pole with loss of extensor function of the knee joint.Contraindications Open rupture of the quadriceps tendon with extended soft-tissue damage and high risk of or ongoing inflammation until healing of the soft tissues. Chronic quadriceps tendon rupture. Ruptures at the musculotendinous junction.Surgical Technique Supine positioning of the patient on a standard operating table with the knee in 30 of flexion. Securing of the proximal tendon stump with two Bunnell sutures using no. 2 FiberWire(R) (Arthrex GmbH, Karlsfeld/Munich, Germany). Creation of a transverse, central trough in the superior pole of the patella. Transosseous refixation of the quadriceps tendon through longitudinal transpatellar drill holes. Intraoperative evaluation of the stability of the suture at 60 of flexion. Repair of the retinacula with multiple interrupted sutures.Postoperative Management Partial weight bearing (15-25 kg) for 6 weeks. Knee orthesis for 6 weeks, with increase of the initially allowed flexion of 30 every 2 weeks by another 30. Initially, continuous passive motion (CPM) and passive movement exercises up to 60 of flexion. After discharge from hospital, outpatient physical therapy with prone active flexion exercises. At the beginning of the 5th week, start with active and passive extension of the knee joint. From the 7th week on, full weight bearing is allowed and coordinative and strengthening exercises should be commenced. Sport activities can gradually be taken up after 3 months.Results Early diagnosis, timely surgical repair and early functional treatment are important for the outcome of quadriceps tendon ruptures. With the presented method, ruptures close to the upper patella pole can be treated. The majority of quadriceps tendon ruptures takes place in this area since the avascular zone found here predisposes to degenerative changes.

TI  - Transseptal pressure gradient and diastolic ventricular septal motion in patients with mitral stenosis
PY  - 1987
AB  - Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the position of the ventricular septum relative to the two ventricles at end-diastole is determined by the instantaneous transseptal pressure gradient (TSG) defined as left ventricular minus simultaneous right ventricular pressure. Since patients with mitral stenosis often have exaggerated leftward (paradox) motion of the ventricular septum during early diastole, we studied seven patients with mitral stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization to determine if position (and therefore motion) of the ventricular septum was determined by TSG throughout diastole. M Mode echocardiograms derived from a two-dimensional parasternal short-axis view were recorded with simultaneous micromanometer measurements of left ventricular and right ventricular pressures. Six of seven patients demonstrated abnormal early diastolic leftward motion of the ventricular septum in at least one cardiac cycle. TSG measured at intervals throughout diastole ranged from -2.5 to +20 mm Hg, with abnormal TSG observed in most of the 40 cardiac cycles selected for analysis. The intracardiac position of the ventricular septum, defined as the distance from the right ventricular epicardium (RVEpi) to the left surface of the ventricular septum normalized for total cardiac dimension (RVEpi-VS), was plotted against left ventricular pressure, right ventricular pressure, and TSG. Linear regression of pooled data from all patients (164 observations) demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the instantaneous TSG and the relative intracardiac position of the ventricular septum (RVEpi-VS = 1.52 TSG + 42.7; r = .79, p < .0001). The position of the ventricular septum was significantly better correlated (p < .0001) with instantaneous TSG than with left ventricular intracavitary pressure (r = .51) or right ventricular intracavitary pressure (r = .28). We conclude that, in patients with mitral stenosis, septal position throughout diastole is determined by the instantaneous TSG. An abnormal TSG in early diastole, probably reflecting the increased impedance to left ventricular filling, results in the exaggerated leftward diastolic septal movement. These data further clarify the complex interplay between active and passive motion of the ventricular septum throughout the cardiac cycle.

TI  - Treatment of Complex Soft-Tissue Defects at the Metacarpophalangeal Joint of the Thumb Using the Bilobed Second Dorsal Metacarpal Artery-Based Island Flap
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to report on reconstruction of complex soft-tissue defects around the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb using a bilobed second dorsal metacarpal artery-based island flap taken from the dorsum of the proximal phalanges of the index and long fingers.Methods: From March of 2007 to October of 2009, the bilobed second dorsal metacarpal artery-based island flap was transferred in 13 patients. There were two defects on the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb. The mean size of the dorsal defects was 2.4 x 3.2 cm; the mean size of the volar defects was 2.6 x 4.0 cm. The mean size of the flaps taken from the index and long fingers was 2.6 x 3.4 cm and 2.8 x 3.2 cm, respectively. The mean pedicle length was 4.9 cm.Results: All flaps survived completely. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, the mean active motion arc of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joints was 42 degrees. The motion of the donor fingers was similar to that on the opposite side. The mean values of static two-point discrimination of the donor sites of the index and long fingers were 6 and 7 mm, respectively.Conclusion: Transferring the bilobed second dorsal metacarpal artery-based island flap is a useful and reliable technique for reconstructing complex defects around the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb.

TI  - Treatment of Distal Fingertip Degloving Injuries Using a Cross-Finger Flap Based on the Dorsal Branch of the Proper Digital Artery at the Middle Phalanx
PY  - 2013
AB  - This study reports our experience with reconstruction of distal fingertip degloving injuries using a single cross-finger flap based on the dorsal branch of the proper digital artery at the middle phalanx. From January 2009 to October 2011, 18 patients (18 fingers) presented with distal fingertip degloving injuries and were treated with this technique. The mean size of the soft tissue defects was 4.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in width. The mean size of the cross-finger flaps was 4.7 x 2.1 cm. In the series, all flaps survived completely. No complication was reported, and no further flap debunking procedure was required. At the mean follow-up period of 20.5 months (range, 12-48 mo), the mean static two-point discrimination was 6.3 mm (range, 5-9 mm) of the reconstructed finger pulp. The total range of active motion of the proximal and the distal interphalangeal joints of the donor fingers were 105 and 77.4 degrees, respectively. The cross-finger flap based on the dorsal branch of the proper digital artery at the middle phalanx is a reliable and simple method in reconstruction of distal degloving injuries of the finger.

TI  - Treatment of Hand Dysfunction After Stroke
PY  - 2007
AB  - Many stroke survivors exhibit persistent upper limb motor deficits and a non‐functional upper limb. There is some promising information that suggests motor learning (ML) in conjunction with functional electrical stimulation (FES; surface FES; nothing implanted; use of a commercially available system) of wrist/finger muscles can significantly enhance the functional level of the upper limb. There have been promising studies showing that some subjects in the chronic phase (greater than 6 months after stroke) responded favorably to combination FES and ML (FES ML). In our pilot studies, FES ML for those in the chronic phase (>12 months) produced statistically significant functional recovery. FES was applied using a commercially available, two‐channel FES system, with electrodes applied to the surface of the skin (non‐invasive). But if upper limb dysfunction is not immediately treated, that is within the sub‐acute phase (less than 6 months) following stroke, the following problems can develop: contractures and other soft tissue changes; chronic pain; and ingrained, abnormal, non‐functional movement patterns. The more long‐standing these symptoms are, the more resistant to treatment they become. Therefore, it is important to provide promising interventions prior to the onset of chronic symptoms and dysfunction. Those in the sub‐acute phase after stroke should be provided with FES ML, in order to more completely restore function for a greater number of stroke survivors. Specific Aims and Hypotheses The goal of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of the proposed treatment in the sub acute phase following stroke. HYPOTHESIS. FES ML for 3hrs/day, five days/week, for 12 weeks will be feasible to implement in the sub‐acute phase following stroke (2 ‐24 weeks). Study Design a. Specific Procedures This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using FES ML for upper extremity rehabilitation in a sub‐acute stroke population. It is a randomized, controlled, single‐blind design. Subjects will be 2 ‐ 24 weeks after a single stroke. The control group will receive standard care for upper limb rehabilitation consisting of passive and active exercise, stretching, bracing, and use of adaptive devices. The experimental group will receive the experimental intervention in addition to their standard care. CONTROL GROUP INTERVENTION. The control group will receive the standard medical care prescribed by the primary physician and covered by the subject's health care policy. Standard care will include: soft tissue mobilization; assisted motion exercise; active motion exercise; resistive exercise; task practice; use of assistive devices; and modality applications conventionally prescribed. FES ML INTERVENTION. The research treatment duration will be 3hrs/day, five days per week. The subjects will be present for a fourth hour each day, which will be used for breaks and rest periods that will be interspersed throughout the intervention time. The treatment duration is derived from prior work. We will stimulate muscles in a number of configurations including: wrist extension and finger extension; wrist extension and finger flexion; and wrist extension, finger flexion, and thumb abduction and opposition. Motor learning will include the performance of functional task components and full task practice during the use of FES. FES will be triggered by the patient, the treating therapist, or it will be automatically sequenced by the device according to alternate channel activations, with timings pre‐set by the treating therapist. MEASURES. Data will be collected at weeks 1, 6, 12 (end of treatment), and 6 months after the end of treatment. Population The subjects will be sub‐acute stroke survivors (2‐24 weeks after stroke).

Design: Quasi-experimental, non-randomized study. Setting: Therapy duration was approximately 5 weeks long for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Participants: Patients treated with conservative treatment (CT) n = 37 and post-surgical treatment (PST) n = 50. Interventions: The INFINITY Method is a special rehabilitation method. It is suitable for patients after surgery and also for those suffering from functional non-structural instability. Passive movement with micromovement and approximation to the joint with small force were used. This movement was only performed on small scale in mm. After repeated supervision, the patients were recommended to also include exercises with active movement, also performed in micromovement at first. Main Outcome Measure(s): Using the VAS, the mean change in pain was 2.4+/-1.2 and 2.2+/-1.6 for the CT and PST groups, respectively. Flexion/ extension was 25.7degree+/-20.8 degree for the CT group and 37.5degree+/-30.2degree for the PST group. External/internal rotation was 25.7degree+/-20.8degree for the CT group and 29.3degree+/-23.4degree for the PST group. Abduction was 17.2degree+/-15.5degree and 22.2degree+/-18.5degree for CT and PST groups, respectively. Results: The results of the study show that the main problem in CT patients is rather a sore shoulder joint, whereas the PST patients have more problems with decreased range of motion due to joint stiffness after surgery. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the INFINITY Method therapy is effective when rehabilitating shoulder joint patients. This special therapy and subsequent self-therapy enable faster return to normal active life.

TI  - Treatment of calcaneal fractures with a locking nail (C-Nail) [Versorgung des Fersenbeinbruchs mit einem Verriegelungsnagel (C-Nail)]
PY  - 2016
AB  - Objective: Anatomic reconstruction of the posterior facet by primary stabilization of the calcaneal fracture with a locking nail. Indications: All intraarticular calcaneal fractures and unstable two-part fractures independent of the degree of closed/open soft tissue trauma. Contraindications: High perioperative risk, soft tissue infection, beak fracture (type II fracture) and still open apophysis. Surgical technique: Anatomic reduction of the posterior facet using a sinus tarsi approach. Reduction and temporary fixation of the sustentacular, tuberosity, and anterior process fragments with 1.8–2.0 mm Kirschner wires. Thereafter, the C-Nail (calcaneus nail) is introduced with its guiding device stabilizing the sustentacular, tuberostity, and anterior process fragments through its three guiding arms with 6 or 7 locking screws. Postoperative management: Passive and active motion starts on postoperative day 2. Lymph drains help reduce swelling. Partial weightbearing with 20 kg for 6–8 weeks in the patient’s own shoes is recommended. X‑ray controls are done at 4 and 8 weeks as well as after 6 and 12 months. Results: A total of 107 calcaneal fractures treated with the C-Nail between 2011 and 2014 were evaluated according to the AOFAS score 6 months and 1 year after surgery. The measured values were on average 93.0 (range 65–100) points at 6 months and 94.1 (range 75–100) points 12 months after the surgery. Böhler’s angle with initial traumatic values of 6.2° (−30 to +13°) improved postoperatively to 31.8°, after 3 months slightly decreased to 29.6°, and after 12 months to 28.3°. There were 2 cases of superficial wound necrosis (1.9 %) and 1 case a deep infection (0.93 %) with need of early C-Nail removal. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Treatment of deep cartilage defects of the patella with periosteal transplantation.
PY  - 1998
AB  - Twenty-six consecutive patients (19 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 31.5 years (range 19-52 years) who suffered from an isolated full-thickness cartilage defect of the patella (area ranged from 0.75 to 20.0 cm2) and disabling knee pain were treated with autologous periosteal transplantation (without any chondrocytes). The duration of symptoms was 59 months (range 11-144 months). During the first 5 postoperative days all patients were treated with continuous passive motion (CPM). This was followed by active motion, slowly progressive strength training, and slowly progressive weight-bearing. After a mean follow-up of 42 months (range 24-76 months), 17 patients (65%) were graded as excellent (were painfree), 8 patients (31%) as good (had pain with strenuous knee-loading activities), and 1 patient as poor (had pain at rest). Twenty-two patients (85%) had returned to their previous occupation. Twelve patients (46%) had resumed sports or recreational activities at their former level. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations showed progressive, and finally complete, filling of the articular defects. Biopsies taken in five randomly selected cases showed hyaline-like cartilage. Patients with full-thickness cartilage defects of the patella and disabling knee pain can be treated with autologous periosteal transplantation (without any chondrocytes), followed by CPM, and slowly progressive strength training and weight-bearing. We believe this is a good method to accomplish regeneration of articular cartilage and satisfactory clinical results.

TI  - Treatment of fifth metacarpal neck fractures with antegrade single elastic intramedullary nailing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of fifth metacarpal neck fractures using antegrade single elastic nail and to explore ideal puncture point to avoid iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury.Methods: A single elastic nail with suitable diameter was used in 27 cases of fifth metacarpal neck fractures with dorsal angulation over 45 degrees. An initial entry point was perforated at the ulnar-dorsal base of the metacarpal. The nail was inserted in an antegrade approach. The nail was usually removed at about 5 weeks postoperatively.Results: At final follow up, all fractures proceeded to bony union. The mean total passive motion was 285 degrees and the mean total active motion (TAM) was 270 degrees. The mean angulation decreased from 50.2 +/- 6.3 degrees preoperatively to 7. 4 +/- 2.3 degrees postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean DASH-Score was 2.1 +/- 3.6 points after surgery. Two cases of skin irritation and one case of the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve (DCBUN) injury were observed. Superficial wound infections were not observed.Conclusions: Collectively, antegrade single elastic intramedullary nailing was a minimally invasive and reliable fixation technique for fifth metacarpal neck fractures with dorsal angulation over 45 degrees. Appropriate puncture position helped to reduce nerve damage.

TI  - Treatment of fractures of the calcaneum by P. Dautry's functional method [LE TRAITEMENT DES FRACTURES DU CALCANEUM SELON LA METHODE FONCTIONNELLE DE P. DAUTRY]
PY  - 1976
AB  - The authors describe the various stages of functional treatment of fractures of the calcaneum described by P. Dautry. The method attempts, by perfectly adapted immediate rehabilitation, to avoid trophic disorders and reactions around the calcaneum. It includes four stages: measures to avoid a swollen foot; active and passive movements in bed; walking is allowed with the physiotherapist from the 45th day onwards using an orthopedic shoe on elastic contention bandage and orthopedic boots; and rehabilitation. This method should, however, be reserved for certain types of fracture where the role of the physiotherapist is essential both in treatment and psychologically.

TI  - Treatment of hallux rigidus with the TOEFIT-PLUS™ joint replacement system
PY  - 2007
AB  - Hemi-and total-replacement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP1) remains controversial due to failures observed in earlier decades. The TOEFIT-PLUS™ system was developed in part to address these earlier failures, but published reports investigating its use have been limited. The TOEFIT-PLUS™ MTP1 joint replacement system is designed with a self-tapping thread on a conical titanium core that provides cement-free, primary stable anchorage and focal pressure reduction in the corticocancellous bone due to an enlarged surface area. The modular design allows surgeons to decide intraoperatively whether to proceed with hemi-or total arthroplasty. Data from 3 studies are presented: 64 patients receiving total prostheses and followed-up annually (Seeber); 12 hemi-prostheses in 10 patients with 5.1 years average follow-up and 6 total prostheses in 5 patients with 1.5 years average follow-up (Knessl); and 54 prostheses (14 hemi-prostheses, 40 total prostheses) in 52 patients followed-up for an average of 3 years (multicenter study). Seeber reported a 42.7-month service life of the prosthesis at the time of follow-up. Five patients (6.8%) were reoperated. Passive hallux motion was 15-18° greater than active motion, and patient satisfaction at follow-up was high. Knessl reported an average range of motion (ROM) in the sagittal plane of 55° with an average dorsal extension of 25.3° and plantar flexion of 30° in patients who received hemi-prostheses. Prosthesis removal was necessary in 3 patients. Prosthesis loosening has not been observed. In patients undergoing total arthroplasty, ROM was recorded at 58°. A revision operation was necessary in 1 patient. Revision surgery was necessary in 11 patients (21.1%) in the multicenter study. Patient-reported outcomes were favorable. © 2007 Springer Paris.

TI  - Treatment of juvenile bone cysts by curettage and filling of the cavity with BAS-0 bioactive glass-ceramic material [Léčba juvenilních kostních cyst exkochleací a výplní bioaktivním sklokeramickým materiálem BAS-0]
PY  - 2004
AB  - Purpose of the study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term results of using the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 for bone tissue replacement after removal of juvenile bone cysts by curettage. Material. Between 1990 and 2000, BAS-0 material was used to fill the cavity after removal of a juvenile bone cyst in 21 patients, 15 males and 6 females, with an average age of 15 years (range 4 to 44 years). Surgical treatment was indicated only in juvenile bone cysts meeting the following criteria: 1) subjective complaints, i. e., pain at activity; 2) X-ray findings of either a) thinning cortical layer with a potential for pathological fracture, particularly in the proximal femur, b) recurrent pathological fractures without apparent healing of the cyst or c) increase in cyst size by 25% within 6 months. In all patients, the diagnosis of a juvenile bone cyst was confirmed by histological examination. Cyst localization was as follows: eight in the humerus, eight in the femur, two in the fibula and one in the ulna, iliac bone and tibia each. Methods. After careful curettage of a soft tissue lining from the inner surface of the cystic cavity, the space was filled completely with 2- to 4- mm BAS-0 granules in 15 patients; in the rest granules were applied in a mixture with cancellous bone graft, which was either autologous or allogenic. The former was implanted in one patient, the latter, taken from either the mother or father, was used in four and one patients, respectively. All patients were clinically and radiologically examined during the follow-up period of 3 to 12 years, with an average of 7 years. The clinical evaluation was based on subjective complaints, and on the state of soft tissues in the region of lesion, range of motion in the adjacent joints and the loading capacity of the limb treated. Radiological evaluation was based on standard X-ray images assessed according to the classification system of Neer. Results. The clinical examination showed that 10 patients were free from subjective complaints, one patient had rest pain, three patients experienced pain when using the limb, four patients reported mild and intermittent pain, two patients were in pain when the whether changed and one patient complained of pain during pregnancy. Objectively, no inflammatory changes of soft tissues were found. Both passive and active motion of the adjacent joints was possible in the full range and the treated limb retained its complete function in all patients. X-ray examination showed excellent results, i. e., no residuum or cysts recurrence, in 16 patients. A residual lesion was present in one patient and cyst recurrence was recorded in four patients. Discussion. The currently used methods of treatment include corticoid instillation in the cyst, injection of autologous bone marrow, multiple drilling and drainage of the cyst and removal of the cyst with subsequent filling of the cavity with bone graft. In our patients, the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 was used to replace either autogenous or allogenic bone grafts. Complete healing of the cyst was achieved in 76% of our patients, which is the result comparable with the literature data. Conclusions. Although the therapy of juvenile bone cysts has changed from extensive surgical procedures to less invasive techniques, the curettage of a cyst with subsequent filling of the residual cavity still remains the method of choice in selected patients. Instead of autogenous cancellous bone grafts or allogenic grafts predominantly used for this procedure, the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 can be recommended, particularly when the cavity to be filled is located in the metaphysis of a long bone, i. e., in the region subject to great compression.

TI  - Treatment of persistent knee pain associated with lumbar dysfunction: a case report
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper aims to describe the rehabilitation of a patient with severe knee pain and chronic low back dysfunction. The patient was referred to physiotherapy by her general practitioner with a diagnosis of knee sprain. Clinical examination by analysis of passive and active movements elicited pain in the knee, and pain referred to the knee from the hip and lumbar spine. Treatment consisted of joint mobilization and specific stabilizing exercises prescribed based on comprehensive clinical reasoning processes, In the first 6 visits the knee was treated, decreasing the level of perceived pain from 7 to 4 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. In the last six visits the lumbar spine dysfunction was addressed, leading to complete relief from symptoms, a situation that was maintained at 12 month follow-up, This case report emphasizes the importance of examining both signs and symptoms of the spine in patients presenting with peripheral joint dysfunctions.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the results obtained from treatment of humeral shaft fractures and their complications using the Osteoline® uniplanar external fixator. Methods: The radiographic and functional results from 78 patients with humeral shaft fractures treated using the uniplanar external fixation technique were retrospectively assessed. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 71 years, with a mean of 47 years. Male patients predominated (79%). Out of the 78 patients, 45 presented open fractures, 14 presented pseudarthrosis and six presented synthesis failure. There were no losses during the follow-up and all the patients were discharged after fracture consolidation and functional recovery. The results were evaluated based on the studies by Catagni, as good, fair or poor. Results: Fracture consolidation was observed in 98% of the cases treated with uniplanar external fixation. Only one pseudarthrosis case required conversion to rigid internal fixation and autologous bone grafting. At the end of the treatment, all the patients were discharged with consolidated fractures, without pain, and good limb function. Conclusion: The external fixation described in this paper was shown to be an efficient and safe method for treating humeral shaft fractures and their complications. It preserved the local biological status and enabled passive and active movement immediately after surgery.

TI  - Treatment of spinal spasticity by electrical stimulation
PY  - 1988
AB  - We present the results and the methodology of trials using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. The aim of our work was to decrease spasticity in 44 patients with traumatic damage to the spinal cord; 35 non-electrically stimulated spastics were used as controls. Both groups were randomly selected from inpatients in the Paraplegic Department at the Hospital Rehabilitation Centre. This electrical stimulation procedure leads to a long-lasting reduction in spasticity, an increased range of passive and active movements, the facilitation of lost functions, an improvement in breathing, an increase in pulmonary capacity, the reappearance of some neurological reflexes, and a diminution of supersensitivity to skin irritation. Blood pressure and neurogenic bladder functions were restored to normal. In addition to clinical observations, we investigated muscle force and the electromyogram; other measurements used in the trials involved the use of a specially adapted neurological hammer, a pendulum test, spirometry, cystometry, sphincterometry and biochemical estimations. © 1988.

TI  - Treatment of sport-related injuries with intramuscular piroxicam. An open cooperative study in Tunisia
PY  - 1990
AB  - An open cooperative study of intramuscular piroxicam was conducted in 50 outpatients (38 men and 12 women) with sport-related musculoskeletal injuries. The patients included in the study were selected from patients attending the Centre de Medecine du Sport in Tunis, Tunisia, between May and December 1988. Patients ranged in age from 15 to 37 years. Patients received a single daily dose of 40-mg piroxicam for the first two days followed by a single daily dose of 20 mg for three to five days. By day 3 pain on movement and tenderness on palpation were reduced by 50% and 66%, respectively, and had resolved in most of the patients by day 7. Similar improvement was noted in the limitation of active and passive movements. Excellent or good efficacy was achieved in 98% of patients and no systemic or local adverse drug reactions were reported. Intramuscular piroxicam provides rapid and effective relief of pain and inflammation caused by sport-related injuries such as acute sprains and tendinitis and exhibits good local and systemic toleration. Convenient once-daily administration and rapid onset of action are decisive factors in the selection of this therapeutic agent in the management of sport-related acute musculoskeletal injuries.

TI  - Treatment of stiffness of the knee by release of the extensor apparatus [TRAITEMENT DES RAIDEURS DU GENOU PAR LIBERATION DE L'APPAREIL EXTENSEUR]
PY  - 1978
AB  - Since 1960, 450 cases of stiffness of the knee were operated on with 77 percent very good or good results. This stiffness develops: a) after a traumatic lesion of the femur or of the knee itself; b) after After an infection process arising early or after a traumatism or its surgical treatment. Whatever the reason may be, it is necessary to wait for 6 months before speaking of stiff knee and compulsory to wait for the healing of the lesion or for the complete elimination of the infection before considering a surgical operation. A knee is stiff for two reasons: a) articular (intraarticular capsular or synovial adhesions); b) extraarticular (adhesion to the neighbouring tissues and retraction of the quadriceps). The operation is divided into two stages: - The first one consists of arthrolysis, carried out by the medial approach and dividing the medial and lateral reticulum patella laterale, freeing the suprapatellar pouch. - The second one consists of disinserting the quadriceps through a postero lateral approach. This disinsertion should be complete at the level of the vastus lateralis which must also be divided at its insertion on the infratrochanteric crest, at the level of the vastus intermedius, less often at the level of the vastus medialis. The freeing of the extensor system is over when a flexion of 100 degrees or more is obtained due to the gravity of the horizontal leg (and not obtained by manually forcing the movement). Post operation rehabilitation should be undertaken as soon as the patient wakes up. The following days, postures in flexion are maintained for a period of 3 or 6 hours, followed by postures in extension of equal duration. The angle obtained should be the same as during the operation. Those alternate postures are carried out for 3 weeks, then active movements are undertaken, until active mobility equals passive mobility.

TI  - Treatment of subacute low back pain with a novel device for continuous passive motion of the spine: A report of three cases
PY  - 2008
AB  - Patients experiencing subacute low back pain (LBP) represent a challenge for the physical therapist. There have been few studies on the use of continuous passive motion of the lumbar spine for the treatment of LBP. Three patients with symptoms of subacute LBP without radiculopathy were treated using a novel device for continuous passive motion of the lumbar spine. The protocol consisted of 12 sessions of lumbar continuous passive motion at 30 minutes per session two to three times per week for 4 to 5 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 12 sessions at 4 to 5 weeks by Oswestry score and active range of motion measurements by a blinded investigator. Clinically significant improvements in Oswestry score and consistent improvements in range were observed. A supervised protocol using a commercial device can benefit some patients with subacute LBP if supervised by a knowledgeable practitioner.

TI  - Treatment of tear of th anterior cruciate ligament combined with localised deep cartilage defects in the knee with ligament reconstruction and autologous periosteum transplantation
PY  - 1999
AB  - An acute tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is frequently associated with injuries to the joint cartilage and subchondral bone. These injuries may progress to deep cartilage defects, causing disabling pain, and represent a therapeutic challenge in patients with the combination instability and pain. At our clinic we treat patients with the combined injury with simultaneous ACL reconstruction and autologous periosteum transplantation of the cartilage defect. This report describes the technique for periosteum transplantation of full-thickness cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyle. Our clinical report includes the first 7 patients (6 men and 1 woman, mean age 29.1 years at operation) who have been followed for 2 years or longer of 14 consecutive patients (12 men and 2 women). All patients had suffered a total tear of the ACL and a full-thickness defect of the cartilage at the medial femoral condyle. The cartilage defects had a mean area of 7.3 cm2 (range 1.0-13.5 cm2). All patients had disabling instability and medial knee pain when walking. The anterior cruciate ligament was reconstructed with a bone-tendon-bone graft of the central third of the patellar ligament. After preparation of the cartilage lesion, the periosteum transplant was anchored to the underlying bone with suture anchors and fibrin glue. Postoperatively, these patients (n = 7) were initially treated with continuous passive motion, followed by active flexibility training and slowly progressing strength training and weight-bearing activities. At follow-up a mean of 31.3 months (range 24-38 months) later, 6 patients evidenced subjectively stable knees, no pain during rest or when walking, and had returned to not too heavy knee-loading work. One patient had a subjectively stable knee, but felt medial knee pain. Meticulous surgical technique and rigorous postoperative rehabilitation are probably of the greatest importance in this procedure. With the use of suture anchors and fibrin glue, the periosteum transplant can be well adapted to the condylar subchondral bone bed.

Postoperatively, these patients (n = 7) were initially treated with continuous passive motion, followed by active flexibility training and slowly progressing strength training and weight-bearing activities. At follow-up a mean of 31.3 months (range 24-38 months) later, 6 patients evidenced subjectively stable knees, no pain during rest or when walking, and had returned to not too heavy knee-loading work. One patient had a subjectively stable knee, but felt medial knee pain. Meticulous surgical technique and rigorous postoperative rehabilitation are probably of the greatest importance in this procedure. With the use of suture anchors and fibrin glue, the periosteum transplant can be well adapted to the condylar subchondral bone bed.

TI  - Treatment of testicular pain using conservative management of the thoracolumbar spine: A case report
PY  - 2003
AB  - Unsuccessful recognition of the origin of testicular pain and a high failure rate of surgical interventions lead to poor outcomes, psychologic distress, and increased costs of care. A frequently overlooked cause of testicular and buttock pain is irritation of the T10-L1 sensory nerve roots, the genitofemoral nerve, and the ilioinguinal nerve. We present the case of a 36-year-old policeman with a 5-year history of back pain and testicular pain of unknown origin. Physical examination of the thoracolumbar region revealed that active movement provoked the patient's buttock symptoms, and local mobility restrictions were present in the thoracolumbar region. A central disk protrusion at T12-L1 was noted on upper lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging, which supports dysfunction of this region. The diagnosis of thoracolumbar stiffness led to implementation of passive and active mobilization of that region and to specific hip stretching and strengthening exercises. After a course of direct and guided physical therapy, the patient attained complete symptom resolution. The patient returned to full work duties as a police officer and resumed his full recreational activity. The excellent outcome achieved in managing this patient was attributed to identifying the origin of referred pain from the thoracolumbar junction.

PY  - 1974
AB  - Before starting treatment for rehabilitation of the hemiplegic patient, the physiotherapist should check whether or not there are any sensory disorders, i.e. an increase or reduction or a complete loss of ability to appreciate temperature, pressure, touch and pain, and whether the consciousness of bodily position and movement is preserved or not. The hand of the hemiplegic patient frequently suffers from sensory disturbances which considerably impede the recovery. The hand which has lost the ability to appreciate the object it holds cannot be fully restored, even when the motor function is good. Treatment by active and passive movements is described and illustrated by 12 photographs.

TI  - Treatment of wrist deformities in children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita
PY  - 2016
AB  - Introduction: Treatment of wrist contractures in children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is extremely problematic because of the high incidence of recurrence. This study aimed to improve the outcome of wrist contracture treatment in children with AMC. Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients (162 wrists) were examined and treated. Patients were assessed using a number of clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological examinations. There are several different clinical variants of wrist contracture, including flexion contracture of the wrist, flexion contracture associated with ulnar deviation, and isolated ulnar deviation of the wrist. Patients were divided into three groups according to the level of spinal cord lesion: C6-C7, C5-C8, and C5-Th1. As the number of damaged spinal cord segments increased, the amplitude of passive and active movements, degree of passive correction, muscle power, and wrist function decreased. Surgical treatment involved the following three approaches: tendon transfers, tendon transfers and carpal wedge osteotomy, and tendon transfers with carpal wedge osteotomy and shortened osteotomy of the forearm. Results: Analysis of treatment results showed that patients with segmental spinal cord lesions at the C6-C7 and C5-C8 level were mostly associated with a good outcome, whereas patients with lesions at the C5-Th1 level achieved satisfactory outcomes. Conclusions: Patients with segmental lesions of the spinal cord at the C6-C7 and C5-C8 level were associated with restoration of active wrist extension up to the neutral position or more and were expected to achieve significant improvement of hand function. Patients with spinal cord lesions at the C5-Th1 level exhibited significant lesions of the muscles, along with bone deformities. Consequently, surgical treatment could only achieve functional wrist position with minimal improvement of hand function. Using differential approaches in the treatment of wrist contracture that are selected by determining the level of spinal cord lesion will enable physicians to predict the outcome and improve the function and appearance of the wrist. © 2016, LLC ECO-vector.

TI  - Trends in Acoustic Tracking: Where are the Fish Going and How Will We Follow Them?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Acoustic tracking of fishes has been conducted for several decades, but within the last 20 years technology has advanced greatly and many researchers have shifted to long-term (multi-year) passive monitoring studies as opposed to active tracking. The number of publications produced using this approach has varied over the last 20 years with dramatic increases in publications using passive telemetry data since the late 1990s. Passive monitoring has been used to address a wide array of topics including behaviorally focused research into home range analysis and presence patterns, physiological studies and technical uses of equipment or methodology. Studies have included over 80 different species including invertebrates, teleost and chondrichthyan fishes, marine reptiles and marine mammals. Research has been conducted in marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems with varying habitats and substrate. This diverse set of studies represents a wide array of research applications and uses of this technology. This text examines the use of acoustic technology and passive acoustic arrays to define where the technology began, describe past advances and comments on the future use of this technology in marine and aquatic ecology.

TI  - Trends in Binaural Technology
PY  - 2013
AB  - Auditory displays play a major role when it comes to experiments using acoustic virtual reality. For more realistic conditions in psychoacoustic experiments, however, the natural reproduction of acoustic stimuli in a virtual acoustic scene should include a physically-based simulation of room acoustics. The goal is to create a virtual scene which should not differ from the real scene in terms of the acoustic impression. In binaural technology static and dynamic acoustic scenes must be discussed separately. In dynamic scenes the benefit of head movements is most significant. In static conditions where head tracking cannot be applied, recent experiments have shown that the individual cues should be maintained in order to achieve the best reproduction result. Hence, there is the need for individually measured or calculated head-related transfer functions as well as individual equalization techniques of the binaural reproduction. Properly created acoustic stimuli can be used in various fields of experiments also in different disciplines. Recent trends in binaural technology will be presented and examples of interdisciplinary experiments will be discussed.

AB  - This research topic presents speech as a natural, well-learned, multisensory communication signal, processed by multiple mechanisms. Reflecting the general status of the field, most articles focus on audiovisual speech perception and many utilize the McGurk effect, which arises when discrepant visual and auditory speech stimuli are presented (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976). Tiippana (2014) argues that the McGurk effect can be used as a proxy for multisensory integration provided it is not interpreted too narrowly. Several articles shed new light on audiovisual speech perception in special populations. It is known that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, e.g., Saalasti et al., 2012) or language impairment (e.g., Meronen et al., 2013) are generally less influenced by the talking face than peers with typical development. Here Stevenson et al. (2014) propose that a deficit in multisensory inte-gration could be a marker of ASD, and a component of the associated deficit in communication. However, three studies suggest that integration is not deficient in some communication disorders. Irwin and Brancazio (2014) show that children with ASD looked less at the mouth region, resulting in poorer visual speech perception and consequently weaker visual influence. Leybaert et al. (2014) report that children with specific language impairment recognized visual and auditory speech less accurately than their controls, affecting audiovisual speech perception, while audiovisual integra-tion per se seemed unimpaired. In a similar vein, adult patients with aphasia showed unisensory deficits but still integrated audiovisual speech information (Andersen and Starrfelt, 2015). Multisensory information can influence response accuracy and processing speed (e.g., Molholm et al., 2002; Klucharev et al., 2003). Scarbel et al. (2014) show that oral responses to speech in noise were faster but less accurate than manual responses, suggesting that oral responses are planned at an earlier stage than manual responses. Sekiyama et al. (2014) show that older adults were more influenced by visual speech than younger adults and correlated this fact to their slower reaction times to auditory stimuli. Altieri and Hudock (2014) report variation in reaction time and accuracy benefits for audiovisual speech in hearing-impaired observers, emphasizing the importance of indi-vidual differences in integration. Finally, Heald and Nusbaum (2014) show that when there were two possible talkers instead of just one, audiovisual information appeared to distract the observer from the task of word recognition and slowed down their performance. This finding demonstrates that multisensory stimulation does not always facilitate performance. While multisensory stimulation is thought to be beneficial for learning (Shams and Seitz, 2008), evidence for this is still scarce. In the current research topic, the overall utility of multisensory learning is brought under question. In a paradigm training to associate novel words and pic-tures, Bernstein et al. (2014) show no benefit of audiovisual presentation compared with audi-tory presentation for normal hearing individuals, and even a degradation for adults with hearing impairment. In a study of cued speech, i.e., specific hand-signs for different speech sounds, Bayard et al. (2014) demonstrate that individuals with hearing impairment used the visual cues differently from their controls, even though both groups were experts in cued speech. Kelly et al. (2014) Tiippana et al. Multisensory and sensorimotor speech perception show that when normal hearing adults learned words in a foreign language, viewing or producing hand gestures accompanying audiovisual speech did not affect the outcome. Lee and Nop-peney (2014) show that musicians had a narrower audiovisual temporal integration window for music, and to a smaller extent also for speech, implying that the effect transfers from the prac-ticed music stimuli also to other stimulus types. Together, these findings suggest that long-term training and active use may be requisites for multisensory information to be useful in learning speech. Neurophysiological correlates of audiovisual speech percep-tion were addressed in the research topic. By using electroen-cephalography (EEG) it was shown that attention (Alsius et al., 2014) and stimulus context (Ganesh et al., 2014) affected early event-related potentials (ERPs) to audiovisual speech. This pro-vides further evidence that audiovisual interactions are not com-pletely automatic. By using functional magnetic resonance imag-ing, Erickson et al. (2014) demonstrate a subdivision of posterior superior temporal areas for integrating congruent vs. incongru-ent audiovisual speech, and Callan et al. (2014) show that differ-ent regions in the premotor cortex were involved in unisensory-to-articulatory mapping and audiovisual integration. Interactions between auditory and motor brain areas dur-ing auditory speech perception were also investigated. By using magnetoencephalography, Alho et al. (2014) demonstrate that connectivity between auditory and motor areas increased from passive listening to clear speech to listening to speech in noise, and that the strength of this connectivity was positively correlated with the accuracy of syllable identification. Moreover, analyses of EEG oscillations revealed that alpha and beta rhythms generated in the sensorimotor and auditory areas were modulated during syllable discrimination tasks (Bowers et al., 2014; Jenson et al., 2014). By using theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation, Rogers et al. (2014) show that disrupting the lip area of the motor cortex impaired discrimination of lip-articulated speech sounds from sounds not articulated on the lips. The involvement of the motor processes is often considered to make speech perception " special, " i.e., essentially different from perception of non-speech stimuli. However, this remains a highly controversial view. Car-bonell and Lotto (2014) claim that speech should not be consid-ered special amongst other stimuli with regards to multisensory integration. Somatosensory information can also influence speech per-ception. Ito et al. (2014) used EEG to study how stretching the skin on both sides of the mouth influences processing of speech sounds, and displayed auditory-somatosensory interaction that was sensitive to intersensory timing. In another EEG study, Treille et al. (2014) report that haptic exploration of the talker's face during speech perception modulated ERPs. These findings confirm that auditory-somatosensory interactions contribute to speech processing. The current research topic shows that speech can be perceived via multiple senses and that speech perception relies on sophis-ticated unisensory, multisensory and sensorimotor mechanisms. Multisensory information can facilitate perception and learning of speech. Still, there is great variation in multisensory percep-tion and integration in both typical and special populations at different ages, which should be studied further in the future.

TI  - Trimed fixation system for displaced fractures of the distal radius
PY  - 2007
AB  - Objective: To study the functional outcome of displaced distal radius fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation with the use of fragment-specific fixation.Methods: Fifteen consecutive displaced distal radius fractures (5 extra-articular and 10 intra-articular) were treated using the Trimed distal radius fixation system (Trimed, Valencia, CA). Radiographic assessment and range of motion of the affected wrist were evaluated postoperatively. Functional outcomes were evaluated with use of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire and the Gartland and Werley scoring system.Results: The mean follow-up was 11 months. The patients initiated controlled passive and active motion exercises during the first week. The mean score on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire was 16 points. The mean return to work was 12 weeks. The functional outcome was 80% excellent or good by the Gartland and Werley scoring system for intra-articular fractures and 80% excellent for extra-articular fractures. Range of active motion in intra-articular fractures was measured 60 degrees wrist extension, 64 degrees flexion, 65 degrees pronation, and 70 degrees supination, and for extra-articular fractures, 75 degrees extension, 70 degrees flexion, 80 degrees pronation, and 75 degrees supination. There was failure of fixation with loss of the reduction that was achieved at the time of operation in one patient.Conclusions: Fragment-specific fixation of unstable distal radius fractures using the Trimed system appears to be effective. Anatomic reduction, earlier range of motion, and improved functional results can be achieved using low-profile implants.

TI  - Trismus Management after Radiation Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer: A French National Survey of Practice
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose/Objective(s): The prevalence of trismus (T) after radiation therapy in head and neck cancer (HNC) ranges from 5% to 38%. There is no standardized T management for head and neck cancer patients and evidence to support any particular protocol. To gain an understanding of current usual practices, a national internet-based survey was developed and sent to all therapists treating HNC patients, as speech therapists (SLPs), physiotherapist (Pi), dentist, and osteopath (Os). Materials/Methods: Questions were generated after discussion and the agreement of all members of a HN multidisciplinary team and were hosted on a website. Therapists were contacted with an e-mail invitation containing a link to the hosting website. The internet-based questionnaire of 66 questions was administered from May 22 to December 9 2014. Results: A total of 370 participants responded to the internet based survey, the distributions of professions of the responders were as follow: SLPs 284, Pi 50, dentist 1, and Os 35. During their initial training 12% of the interviewed therapists had education on T, 88.37% of them judged the teaching incomplete or insufficient. For 100% of Pi and Os, and 85% of SLPs considered T as part of their domain of skills. Pi considered themselves as highly qualified in 36.39% of case, Os 33.42%, SLP 32.08%. Among the professionals that support specific HN pathologies 17% Os, 32% SLPs, 26% Pi have already treated T, while 21% of Pi, 29% of SLP and 25% of Os have never treated T. For 82% of this population lack of training is the major reason. Among the professionals who do not treat specific HN pathologies the major reasons cited are “never faced this type of pathology” (79%), “not trained” (27%), “not interested” (13%). For therapists 61% of the patients had difficulty to find a professional able to treat them. Usual practices were analyzed, the results suggested that therapists intervened reactively (75%) rather than proactively (25%). However therapists are more likely to intervene with patients proactively (63%) than curatively (37%). Therapists believe in 96% of case that the exercises should be performed every day. The intensity proposed is: less than 5 min 44%, between 6 and 10 min 32%, 15 min 14%, more than 20 min 10%. For 61% of patient the therapists judged the compliance satisfactory. All the categories of therapists proposed thermotherapy (25.5%), relaxation (65%), massage (92%), passive motion exercises (82%), active motion exercises (94%), manual stretching (80%), breathing (76%), technical compensatory (82%), and use of a jaw rehabilitation device (33%). Conclusion: Responses from 370 therapists revealed that there is a lack of consensus regarding timing, intensity, and type of T therapy. This is undoubtedly due the lake of training, to a paucity of research addressing the efficacy of T treatments in the HNC population.

TI  - Trunk stability in dynamic movement
PY  - 2006
AB  - Spinal stability has been characterized in static but not in dynamic movements. The goal of this study was to determine whether movement pace and direction of dynamic trunk flexion influence the control of spinal stability. Twenty healthy subjects performed dynamic lifting movements at 20 and 40 cycles per minute. Lyapunov exponents were calculated from the measured trunk kinematics to estimate stability. Complexity of torso dynamics required at least five embedded dimensions thereby indicating that torso dynamics requires more than the 3-dimensions of movement for sufficient characterization. Dynamic stability is was greater in slow lifting movement than in fast movements. Asymmetric movements demonstrated greater multi-dimensional kinematic divergence than asymmetric movements. This indicates that the sagittal plane of movement may not be a principle dynamic axis of torso movement. Results provide biomechanical insight regarding the role of workplace design and risk of musculoskeletal instability in dynamic lifting tasks.

TI  - Tunable acoustic absorbing system for semi-active noise control
PY  - 2000
AB  - An acoustic absorber with tunable compliance is presented. Most of passive acoustic absorber could absorb an only sound around a fixed frequency. We propose a tunable acoustic absorber for a semi-active noise control system in order to solve above limitation and to reduce variable frequency noises. The developed absorber forms an array of Helmholtz resonator with a micro perforated plate. The absorber has an air cavity whose volume is tunable so as to adjust its resonant frequency to a desired frequency. As the system control method, we employed the conversion method from frequency to gap of the air cavity (f -L) in order to ditermine the desired parameters of the absorber. This paper reports characteristics of our developed tunable acoustic absorbing system. © 2000 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. AH rights reserved.

TI  - Turbulent flux events in a nearly neutral atmospheric boundary layer
PY  - 2007
AB  - We propose here a novel method of analysing turbulent momentum flux signals. The data for the analysis come from a nearly neutral atmospheric boundary layer and are taken at a height of 4 m above ground corresponding to 1.1 X 10(5) wall units, within the log layer for the mean velocity. The method of analysis involves examining the instantaneous flux profiles that exceed a given threshold, for which an optimum value is found to be 1 s.d. of the flux signal. It is found feasible to identify normalized flux variation signatures separately for positive and negative 'flux events' the sign being determined by that of the flux itself. Using these signatures, the flux signal is transformed to one of events characterized by the time of occurrence, duration and intensity. It is also found that both the average duration and the average time-interval between successive events are of order 1 s, about four orders of magnitude higher than a wall unit in time. This episodic description of the turbulence flux in the time domain enables us to identify separately productive, counter-productive and idle periods ( accounting, respectively, for 36, 15 and 49% of the time), taking as criterion the generation of the momentum flux. A 'burstiness' index of 0.72 is found for the data. Comparison with laboratory data indicates higher (/ lower) ejection (/ sweep) quadrant occupancy but lower (/ higher) contributions to flux from the ejection (/ sweep) quadrant at the high Reynolds numbers of the atmospheric boundary layer. Possible connections with the concept of active and passive motion in a turbulent boundary layer are briefly discussed.

AB  - Communication is the bottom line to the dentist's success. That statement applies to both professional and personal relationships. Communication is an exchange of both information and feelings. A message is sent and a message is received. The key to effective communication is to send messages clearly and succinctly, so that the recipient interprets the meaning of the message correctly. The only way to determine if the recipient has interpreted the message correctly is to request feedback. Reading, writing, speaking and listening are four types of communication that are very important with both team members and patients. Listening is composed of four valuable skills: 1. body language, 2. tone of voice, 3. passive listening, and 4. active listening. Every system in the practice is vital to the health and well-being of the practice. However, the fulcrum of the practice is comprehensive diagnosis through treatment-planning and beautifully prepared and presented consultations. If patients do not accept treatment recommendations, nothing else really matters. When a team of dental professionals participate in communication training, burnout and dropout decrease, personal relationships and teamwork improve, job satisfaction accelerates, stress is reduced, and production increases.

TI  - Turnaround bump reduction in a linear hydraulic actuator by mechanical means
PY  - 2004
AB  - The Vertical Motion Simulator at NASA Ames Research Center utilizes custom non-hydrostatic hydraulic actuators to drive its roll, pitch, yaw and longitudinal axis. These actuators have operated flawlessly with one exception; they exhibit a phenomenon that is detrimental to the motion fidelity called "Turnaround Bump" (TAB). TAB occurs in all hydraulic actuators with seals at the onset of motion (extending or retracting) when the friction on the seals changes from the higher static (no motion) to the lower dynamic (motion) friction. The sudden change in the friction force causes an acceleration spike that can be felt by the pilot thus giving a false motion cue. In order to reduce TAB without going to costly hydrostatic actuators, a cost effective mechanism was designed that constantly rotates the piston rod end of the actuator so that the piston rod never stops moving relative to the seals even when the actuator stops moving in the linear direction.

TI  - Twenty-Five Years of Multielectrode Recordings in the Somatosensory System: It is All about Dynamics
PY  - 2008
AB  - Chronic multielectrode recording methods introduced 25 years ago have opened up the opportunity to simultaneously sample the activity of neurons at multiple levels of the somatosensory system while rats engage in active tactile behaviors. This chapter focuses on results gleaned from recordings in the rat whisker system. The earliest multielectrode investigations revealed that the peak of neural activity evoked by single-whisker stimuli drifts widely over the cortical and thalamic somatotopic whisker maps. This property could provide a mechanism for recognizing spatiotemporal patterns of whisker stimulation. These studies also showed that information about tactile stimulus identity is carried by the relative latencies of evoked spikes in different simultaneously recorded neurons. Subsequent experiments also revealed highly synchronized firing in neurons from brainstem to cortex, and immediate receptive field reorganization in thalamus induced by partial deafferentation or reversible inactivation of primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Even the two hemispheres of S1, long viewed as independent modules for processing exclusively contralateral stimuli, were found to interact on millisecond timescales in anesthetized and waking rats. This later finding suggested that the brain combines bilateral whisker afferents to discriminate bilateral whisker stimuli - such as the widths of tunnel openings in the dark - an idea that was confirmed by the development of bilateral tactile discrimination tasks. Multielectrode recordings during tactile discrimination revealed qualitatively distinct response modes in S1 as compared to responses to passive whisker stimulation, including task-related firing rate modulations that begin well before whisker stimulation. These data have pushed our conception of somatosensory representation - even at the earliest thalamic and cortical processing stages - away from the static classical one-barrel/one-whisker picture, toward that of a highly plastic multilevel structure whose functional architecture quickly adjusts to meet the demands of the present situation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Two cases of Ménière's disease associated with persistent postural-perceptual dizziness [持続性知覚性姿勢誘発めまいを併発したメニエール病の 2 例]
PY  - 2020
AB  - Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is new conception published by the Barany Society in 2017. There are five diagnostic criteria for PPPD. The main symptom is continuous dizziness for more than three months, that is not explained by other diseases. The symptom is exacerbated by an upright position, active or passive movement, and moving or complex visual stimuli. The appearance of a balance disorder (e.g., vertigo) precedes PPPD. It is possible that PPPD patients can be handicapped in their activities of daily living (ADL). We report herein on two cases of Ménière's disease associated with PPPD. The affected patients were in the interval stage of Ménière's disease, and had no vestibular dysfunction. No abnormality was seen on head and cerebellopontine angle MRI. However, the patients had been experiencing both a floating and a rotating sensation over a prolonged period. Their symptom was exacerbated by an upright position, active or passive movement, and moving or complex visual stimuli. The floating sensation made them inactive. We distinguished PPPD from Ménière's disease, and correctly diagnosed PPPD. The reported treatments of PPPD are medication, rehabilitation, and cognitive behavior therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy was effective for both patients. These two Ménière's disease cases indicated the possibility that the Ménière's disease may sift to PPPD during the interval stages, and it requires a different strategy of treatment compared with Ménière's disease-related symptoms. © 2020 Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

TI  - Two temporal channels underlie the dynamic motion after effect
PY  - 2002
AB  - Purpose: To characterise the temporal tuning of the motion aftereffect (MAE) using temporally filtered dynamic random noise (DRN). Methods: Adaptation to orthogonal bivectorial motion was used to produce the MAEs, whose direction was measured. Adapting speeds were either: 1.5 & 6, 1.5 & 24, or 6 & 24 deg/s. Each speed pair was tested with DRN filtered into one of 5 octave-width passbands with centre frequencies: 1.1, 2.1, 4.3, 8.5 & 17 Hz. MAE directions were then re-measured using DRN interleaved with a static noise pattern. Finally, MAEs were measured on a static-only noise pattern. Results: Dynamic only: MAE direction for the 4-octave speed difference (1.5/24 deg/s) changed smoothly from opposite the slower vector to opposite the faster vector as test temporal frequency increased. The 2-octave speed pairs also varied smoothly with test frequency but over smaller directional ranges. Static only: MAE direction for static test patterns was directly opposite the slower vector for the 1.5/24 & 6/24 deg/s pairs, and opposite the vector sum for the 1.5/6 deg/s pair. Dynamic+static: Interleaving a static component with the temporally filtered DRN had little or no effect on MAE direction. Conclusions The asymmetries in the dynamic-only conditions fit a two-channel model of temporal processing, comprising a low-pass and a high, bandpass channel. Dynamic MAEs seem to reflect the combined adaptation in both channels. The static MAE behaves quite differently and does not appear to interact with the dynamic MAE, being possibly mediated by mechanisms in the form pathway.

TI  - Two- to Eight-Month-Old Infants' Perception of Dynamic Auditory-Visual Spatial Colocation
PY  - 2011
AB  - From birth, infants detect associations between the locations of static visual objects and sounds they emit, but there is limited evidence regarding their sensitivity to the dynamic equivalent when a sound-emitting object moves. In 4 experiments involving thirty-six 2-month-olds, forty-eight 5-month-olds, and forty-eight 8-month-olds, we investigated infants' ability to process this form of spatial colocation. Whereas there was no evidence of spontaneous sensitivity, all age groups detected a dynamic colocation during habituation and looked longer at test trials in which sound and sight were dislocated. Only 2-month-olds showed clear sensitivity to the dislocation relation, although 8-month-olds did so following additional habituation. These results are discussed relative to the intersensory redundancy hypothesis and work suggesting increasing specificity in processing with age.

TI  - Two-field surface pattern control via marginally stable magnetorheological elastomers
PY  - 2017
AB  - The stability and post-bifurcation of a non-linear magnetoelastic film/substrate block is experimentally exploited to obtain active control of surface roughness. The non-intuitive interplay between magnetic field and elastic deformation owes to material and geometry selection, namely a ferromagnetic particle composite film bonded on a compliant passive foundation. Cooperation of the two otherwise independent loading mechanisms-mechanical pre-compression and magnetic field-allows one to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields. We demonstrate for the first time that the critical magnetic field is a decreasing function of pre-compression and vice versa. The experimental results are then probed successfully with full-field finite element simulations at large strains and magnetic fields. The magnetoelastic coupling allows for reversible on/off control of surface wrinkling under adjustable critical magnetic and mechanical fields, thus this study constitutes a first step towards realistic active haptic and morphing devices.

TI  - Tympanal Spontaneous Oscillations Reveal Mechanisms for the Control of Amplified Frequency in Tree Crickets
PY  - 2018
AB  - Tree cricket hearing shows all the features of an actively amplified auditory system, particularly spontaneous oscillations (SOs) of the tympanal membrane. As expected from an actively amplified auditory system, SO frequency and the peak frequency in evoked responses as observed in sensitivity spectra are correlated. Sensitivity spectra also show compressive non-linearity at this frequency, i.e. a reduction in peak height and sharpness with increasing stimulus amplitude. Both SO and amplified frequency also change with ambient temperature, allowing the auditory system to maintain a filter that is matched to song frequency. In tree crickets, remarkably, song frequency varies with ambient temperature. Interestingly, active amplification has been reported to be switched ON and OFF. The mechanism of this switch is as yet unknown. In order to gain insights into this switch, we recorded and analysed SOs as the auditory system transitioned from the passive (OFF) state to the active (ON) state. We found that while SO amplitude did not follow a fixed pattern, SO frequency changed during the ON-OFF transition. SOs were first detected above noise levels at low frequencies, sometimes well below the known song frequency range (0.5-1 kHz lower). SO frequency was observed to increase over the next similar to 30 minutes, in the absence of any ambient temperature change, before settling at a frequency within the range of conspecific song. We examine the frequency shift in SO spectra with temperature and during the ON/OFF transition and discuss the mechanistic implications. To our knowledge, such modulation of active auditory amplification, and its dynamics are unique amongst auditory animals.

AB  - Although the anatomy of the nasal muscles and the active movement of the nasal alae brought about by them, were already known in ancient times (Galenos), it was only at the end of the 19th century that the collapse of the nasal alae was recognized as a passive mechanism obstructing the inspiratory air passages. Since surgical methods for treating this condition were not available at that time, various small gadgets to be introduced into the nasal vestibulum were invented for stabilising the alae. Among these, Feldbausch's nasal dilator was the best known. It was in use up to the middle of this century, but then became completely obsolete. The history of this chapter of rhinology is related primarily by means of literal quotations of the phrases with which the authors presented their devices and praised their virtues.

TI  - ULTRASOUND EVALUATION OF A-P TRANSLATION OF THE HUMERAL HEAD IN STABLE AND MULTIDIRECTIONALLY UNSTABLE SHOULDER JOINTS
PY  - 1991
AB  - In a prospective study we evaluated the active a-p translation of the humeal head in the glenoid socket and the passive cranio-caudal translation of the humeral head in relation to the acromion. In 150 healthy volunteers we documented normative data. These results were compared with the data recorded in 34 patients with multidirectional shoulder instabilities. With the arm adducted or in 90-degrees flexion we found no statistically significant differences between volunteers and patients or between the sexes, or between the dominant and the non-dominant extremity in the relationship between the humeral head and the dorsal brim of the glenoid. In 90-degrees abduction and neutral rotation of the arm the dorsal overhang of the humeral head in relation to the dorsal brim of the glenoid was 1.5 mm (+/- 3.5 mm) on the dominant and 1.9 mm (+/- 3.4 mm) on the non-dominant side in the volunteer group. However, in patients with multidirectional shoulder instability the humeral head demonstrated such a high degree of a.-p. translation that we found a ventral overhang of 2.9 mm (+/- 3.7 mm) on the dominant and 0.7 mm (+/- 4.6 mm) on the opposite side. These differences to the volunteer group were statistically highly significant (P < 0.001). In patients the difference between the dominant and the non-dominant extremity was also significant (P < 0.05). After active movement into the 90-degrees abducted and external rotated position of the arm the differences between volunteers and patients increased, until finally the differences in patients between the dominant and the non-dominant side were highly significant. In addition, when comparing the a.-p. translation of the non-dominant side of the patients with multidirectional instability with the volunteer group we found a highly significantly larger a.-p. translation in the patients' joints. The cranio-caudal translation of the humeral head was passively proved with the sulcus sign under ultrasound control. In the volunteer group we found a translation of 2.4 mm (+/- 1.9 mm) on the dominant and of 2.3 mm (+/- 2.2 mm) on the non-dominant side. The translation of 6.1 mm (+/- 3.3 mm) on the dominant and 4.4 mm (+/- 2.4 mm) on the non-dominant side and also the comparison of both sides with each other showed highly significant differences in patients. Finally, the ultrasound-controlled test was more sensitive than the clinical test. In 7 patients with negative clinical test results we documented a larger cranio-caudal translation than in the volunteer group by ultrasound. The documentation of diagnostic criteria such as bilateral instability or inferior instability, in contrast to unidirectional instabilities, is of clinical relevance. In the recognition of inferior instability the ultrasound-controlled caudal stress of the arm was more sensitive than the clinical sulcus sign. By ultrasound the eximer has an additional diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of instabilities of the glenohumeral joint and a useful opportunity of documentation.

TI  - ULTRASOUND STRAIN IMAGING IN ASSESSMENT OF BICEPS MUSCLE STIFFNESS AND DYNAMIC MOTION IN HEALTHY ADULTS
PY  - 2017
AB  - We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of using ultrasound strain imaging (USI) to assess biceps brachii muscle (BBM) stiffness and dynamic motion in 10 healthy adults. The BBM axial deformation was produced by external compression with a sandbag (1.0 kg) tied onto the transducer. The BBM lateral movement was produced by manual passive elbow flexion and extension. By use of 2-D speckle tracking, captured 5-s real-time ultrasound data of BBM were processed to estimate axial strain, representing muscle stiffness, and lateral strain and tissue velocity, representing muscle dynamic motion. Axial (lateral) strain ratio was defined as BBM strain divided by subcutaneous soft tissue strain. There was no significant difference in lateral strain or tissue velocity between the left and right BBM (lateral strain ratio: 4.69 +/- 0.07 vs. 4.51 +/- 0.08 for extension, 4.82 +/- 0.09 vs. 4.69 +/- 0.11 for flexion; tissue velocity: 1.58 +/- 0.32 cm/s vs. 1.78 +/- 0.85 cm/s for extension, -2.03 +/- 0.63 vs. -2.03 +/- 0.59 for flexion; all p values > 0.05) or between men and women (lateral strain ratio: 4.52 +/- 0.06 vs. 4.67 +/- 0.1 for extension, 4.71 +/- 0.11 vs. 4.83 +/- 0.09 for flexion; tissue velocity, cm/s: 1.76 +/- 0.76 vs. 1.66 +/- 0.65 for extension, -2.21 +/- 0.65 vs. -1.88 +/- 0.52 for flexion, all p values > 0.05). The difference in axial stain between men and women was significant (axial strain ratio: 3.09 +/- 0.43 vs. 3.52 +/- 0.26, p = 0.02). Inter-and intra-observer reliability in performing USI of the BBM was good (all intra-class correlation coefficients [ICCs]> 0.75). Our results suggest that USI seems to be feasible for and reproducible in estimating BBM mechanical properties and motion dynamics in healthy adults.

TI  - UNDERWATER PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING & NOISE IMPACTS ON MARINE FAUNA-A WORKSHOP REPORT
PY  - 2013
AB  - The marine ecosystem is being increasingly subjected to underwater noise from industrial operations. Our ability to monitor the marine soundscape using passive acoustic technology is important to determine the potential impacts of anthropogenic sound. The objectives of this workshop were to define our current capabilities with regard to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM); to define our current state of knowledge of the marine soundscape, and of underwater noise in particular, and of noise impacts; to identify the needs and concerns of the various stakeholders; and to determine future research and development needs. The workshop was held in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 21 November 2012, the day before the Australian Acoustical Society's annual conference. Three tutorial sessions were presented by leading researchers in the field on underwater acoustic terminology, metrics, the basics of sound propagation, noise modelling and prediction, the marine soundscape (physical ambient, anthropogenic and biological sources), sound recording technology and methods, noise impacts on marine fauna, mitigation and environmental management. Tutorials were followed by rapid-fire presentations of current research associated with the themes of passive acoustic monitoring and noise impact. Discussions pursued on the presented topics, with emphasis on stakeholder needs, prevailing problems, knowledge gaps, potential solutions and future initiatives. The workshop was attended by over 70 participants from within Australia and abroad, hosting a diverse range of expertise and representing the various stakeholders in the marine environment: the offshore oil and gas industry, consulting industry, fishing industry, defence, government (environmental officers, regulators, fisheries officers), environmental groups and academia. The outcomes of the workshop were:An appreciation of PAM for monitoring of marine fauna, for ecological studies, for measurements of anthropogenic noise, for studying noise impacts and for mitigation monitoring;A demonstration of the effectiveness of PAM for presence and abundance monitoring (with more acoustic detections than visual in certain circumstances);An understanding of the limitations of PAM (to vocalising animals) and the potential of combining PAM with visual observations and possibly active acoustic imaging to increase detection probability;An appreciation of the differences between regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions;The identification of the need to monitor (and address noise impacts on) entire ecosystems including less iconic (=non-mammalian) species;The identification of knowledge gaps with regards to unidentified sounds in marine soundscapes, natural variability in soundscapes with space and time necessitating long-term baseline recording, noise impacts on the vast majority of marine species, anthropogenic source signatures and sound transmission.

AB  - The author reports an operation of total replacement of the shoulder based on the principle of inversion of the articular surfaces. The cup is fixed by means of a rod sealed into the humeral diaphysis, and the sphere is screwed on the scapula, by means of a support which presses on the glenoid cavity. The polyethylene cup is semiretentional and turns in all directions on the metallic sphere, permitting at least passively without any risk of dislocation, all required movements. The stability of the shoulder and the lack of pain were obtained in all patients operated on (11 cases including 6 with sufficient follow up). In regard to active movements, there is a problem of muscle physiology which remains unsolved. The cup plays a passive role and cannot replace the active role of the muscle tendon capsule, which should be preserved. Research on this subject continues and it is mainly the model of the prosthesis and the means of fixation which are presented here.

PY  - 1995
AB  - Basic investigations in the field of adaptation luminance were carried out using Holladay's visual threshold criterion. The connection between adaptation luminance L(A), illumination at the spot in the eye E(Bl) and the angle of glare Θ is L(A) = 9.2 x E(Bl) x Θ-2 L(A) in cd/m2, E(Bl) in lx, Θ in degrees. In most cases the investigations of adaptation luminance were also carried out under conditions of fixed view and static visual tasks. It is, however, important to take into account the dynamic visual task and the adaptation process by determining the adaptation luminance, but very few measurements have been carried out under these conditions . For the results represented here the visual threshold was replaced by the readaptation time necessary for perception of movement direction of a striped pattern (dynamic) and with the idea of also comparing the perception of the slot location in a ring in the Landolt rings (static). The method of investigations was as follows: The subject adapts to the inhomogeneous field of luminance for which the adaptation luminance must be determinated. Then in a dark surrounding field for comparison, the visual task is offered, and the readaptation time necessary for the fulfillment of the visual task is measured. This procedure is repeated with a homogeneous field of luminance. The luminance of a homogeneous field is equal to the adaptation luminance. If the readaptation times are equal, the inhomogeneous distribution of luminance has the adaptation luminance L(A). The important difference in comparison to previous investigations is the inclusion of dynamic components (readaptation time and dynamic visual task). The measurements showed good accordance between the static values and the dynamic visual aims. For the lower illumination grades in particular, departures from the 'classic' results by Holladay were obtained. The measured values can be described by the equation L(A) = 9.8·E(Bl)0,73·Θ-1.2. As the values measured for the dynamic and static tasks are in agreement with each other, the disagreement with Holladay must be connected to the equivalence criterion, but that means that the adaptation luminance is not an obvious description of a field of luminance, but also depends on the equivalence criterion of the dynamic visual aims that are dominant under traffic conditions. For this reason it cannot be expected that the Holladay equation can help to determine adequate adaptation luminance in this case.

TI  - UNUSUAL PRESENTATION OF GLUTEN SENSITIVITY IN A CHILD: SYMMETRICAL DISTAL MYOPATHY
PY  - 2013
AB  - A 16-year-old athletic female presented with the single complaint of bilateral leg pain in the lateral compartments. She complained of constant, severe burning pain with occasional sharp, stabbing pain of three years duration. Orthopedic diagnosis was bilateral compartment syndrome. She had undergone two separate bilateral fasciotomies which yielded no change in symptoms. She had also undergone multiple rounds of physical therapy which produced no symptomatic improvement. Clinical examination by the author was significant only for weakness of the tibialis anterior bilaterally, with pain on active and passive movement. A review of systems questionnaire revealed mild gastrointestinal symptoms alternating constipation and diarrhea, gas, bloating and fullness after meals. Laboratory parameters revealed the diagnosis of gluten-sensitivity with positive autoimmune markers. These findings suggested an etiology of an autoimmune polymyositis as the pathophysiology of her leg pain. She was recommended to follow a gluten-free diet, and within four months, nearly all of her leg pain and gastrointestinal symptoms had resolved. Her remaining discomfort was eliminated after a twelve-week course of vibration and muscle stimulation in the legs. This therapy is theorized to have reversed neuro-plastic changes, which favored increased efficiency of nociceptive afferent integration. This presentation is unique in the literature and considering that gluten-related myopathies can be present without significant enteropathy, gluten sensitivity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with unexplained and unresponsive musculoskeletal pain.

TI  - USN confronts fresh wrangling over active sonar use
PY  - 2007
AB  - The California Coastal Commission has approved the US Navy's (USN's) use of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar, subject to a raft of requirements. In the July, 2006, the USN truck a deal the Natural Resources Defese Council (NRDC) environmental campaign group to revoke a court ban against the use of MFA sonar during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise off the coast of Hawaii. The green signal for training from the Californian authorities is conditional on a comprehensive list of 14 mitigation measures that the USN must adopt in an effort to protect marine mammals such as blue whales, grey whales, dolphins and porpoises. These measures include safety zones to ensure marine mammals are not exposed to noises above 154 dB and qualified observers to monitor the area. The commission wants the USN to adopt passive acoustic monitoring to enforce the safety zones, and the use aircraft to conduct aerial monitoring during the assigned mission.

TI  - UV Light Interference Method for Measuring Magnetic Head Slider Flying Heights
PY  - 1994
AB  - A new flying height tester has been developed for magnetic head sliders. This tester measures the light interference fringe patterns between the slider and a glass disk, and calculates the absolute flying height from their peak positions. The tester uses monochromatic incoherent UV and visible light, which has a minimum wavelength of about 200 nm, and the slider's dynamic motion measurement system is separated from the static flying height measurement system. Hence, it can measure a 50 nm flying height within an error of less than 1 nm. The tester can also measure a slider's dynamic motion in the 0-100 kHz frequency range using photodiode arrays. The performance of the tester was confirmed through careful experiments. © 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite of pharmacological and physiotherapeutical prophylaxis the development of a deep venous thrombosis represents a faithful complication of immobilising therapy regimen. The intensivation of physical administrations may prevent the manifestation of deep phlebothrombosis. Among the joint and muscle pumps which are hemodynamically active the so-called ankle-pump is of paramount importance. In this preclinical study we could show that continuous passive motion of the ankle joint with a special device system is able to stimulate the maximal venous flow in the deep venous system (V. femoralis communis; Duplex-technique) of normal volunteers and volunteers with chronic venous insufficiency. This increase of venous flow was accompanied by a significantly increase of arterial flow in both groups. The results of this study pointed out the hemodynamical effect of passive motion of the ankle-pump.

AB  - The use of ultrasonic waves in NDE is reviewed. The principles of active (ultrasonic) and passive (acoustic-emission) testing techniques are reviewed. Specific examples of applications from several industries illustrate the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art techniques based on these principles. Detailed discussion is then given of present research and development activities designed to overcome these limitations, with particular emphasis on those areas best addressed by the tools of electrical engineering. Included are discussions of instrumentation, inspection performance modeling, flaw-sizing techniques (including imaging systems), material-property measurement techniques, and acoustic-emission techniques. The paper concludes with a consideration of important directions of future work. (Author)

TI  - Ultrasonographic Assessment of Long Finger Tendon Excursion in Zone V During Passive and Active Tendon Gliding Exercises
PY  - 2010
AB  - Purpose Cadaver and in vivo studies report variable results for tendon excursion during active and passive hand movements. The purpose of this study was to measure long finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon excursion during active and passive movement using high-resolution ultrasound images.Methods The FDP tendon excursion was measured at the wrist level in 10 healthy subjects during full tip-to-palm active and passive flexion of the fingers. Passive movement was performed 2 ways: (I) straight to full fist: passive flexion starting at the metacarpophalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joint flexion; and (2) hook to full fist: passive flexion starting at the distal interphalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion. Tendon excursion was measured using an in-house-developed, frame-to-frame analysis of high-resolution ultrasound images.Results Median FDP excursion was 24.3 mm, 14.0 mm, and 13.6 mm for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Tendon excursions during active movements was significantly larger than excursions during passive movements (p = .005). The adjusted median tendon excursion was 12.7 mm/100 degrees, 7.5 mm/100 degrees, and 7.4 mm/100 degrees for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Adjusted tendon excursions during active movement were significantly larger than those achieved during passive straight to full fist movement). Adjusted tendon excursions during straight to full fist movements were significantly larger than those achieved during passive hook to full list movement.Conclusions Active motion produced 74% and 79% increases in excursions compared to both passive motions in healthy controls. The study results can serve as a reference for evaluating excursions in patients with tendon pathology, including those who have had tendon repair and reconstruction. (J Hand Surg 2010;35A:559-565.

TI  - Ultrasonographic Measurement of Tendon Displacement Caused by Active Force Generation in the Psoas Major Muscle
PY  - 2008
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of using ultrasonography for detecting the force generated by the psoas major muscle, a muscle positioned in the deep trunk. We measured the displacement of central tendon on B-mode ultrasound images of two different longitudinal sections of the muscle during passive hip flexion-extension and isometric hip flexion at varied hip angles. In both tasks, the values of tendon displacement obtained independently from each section coincided well, indicating that tendon displacement took place along a straight trajectory, i.e., close to the nodal line between two scanned planes. It was strongly correlated with both the hip angle (R-2 = 0.98) and the hip-flexion torque (R-2 = 0.83). In the second set of experiment, we measured the tendon displacement during dynamic movements with the combination of ultrasonography and VICON-based motion analysis. From the tendon displacement during dynamic thigh lifting and walking, the force generated by the muscle could be estimated by extracting the force-related component. These results indicate that ultrasonography of the psoas major muscle can measure the displacement of its central tendon accompanied with either length change of the muscle or the elongation of tendon. Although much allention has to be paid to the limitations of this methodology, ultrasonography may be useful for detecting the force generation of the muscle during a variety of dynamic movements.

TI  - Ultrasonographic findings of painful shoulders and correlation between physical examination and ultrasonographic rotator cuff tear.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify ultrasonographic (US) abnormalities and to compare physical examination with US findings, especially of rotator cuff abnormalities in patients with shoulder pain. A total of 120 patients with shoulder pain were prospectively studied. The physical examination of shoulders was performed as follows: (1) the area of tenderness; (2) the range of passive and active motion for abduction, forward flexion, external rotation, and internal rotation; (3) Neer and Hawkins's tests for shoulder impingement; and (4) maneuvers for determining the location of the tendon lesions. Transverse and longitudinal planes from the long head of the biceps, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons, the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa, and the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints were included for US examination. The range of motion most affected by shoulder pain was abduction, followed by external rotation and forward flexion. The most frequent US finding was effusion in the long head of the biceps tendon. Among the rotator cuff tendons, supraspinatus was the most frequently involved. Physical examination had low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of tendon tear. US examination leads to an anatomical diagnosis of shoulder pain in many patients. Whether the US examination of the painful shoulder improves its treatment should be investigated.

TI  - Ultrasonography features of an adductor longus tear: Case report
PY  - 2001
AB  - The patient's pain did not improve, however. An ultrasonographic examination, performed approximately 4 weeks later with a 7.5-MHz highresolution linear array transducer, revealed a large hematoma in the left groin associated with a tear in the myotendinous junction of the left adductor longus (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The hematoma, measuring about 3 cm x 1 cm, was adjacent to the myotendinous gap, which measured about 0.5 cm. Under local anesthetic and ultrasonographic guidance, the hematoma was aspirated completely (Fig. 3) and the muscle tear at the myotendinous junction was injected with 2 mL (20 mg/inj) each of 1% lidocaine and triamcinolone. Aseptic technique was employed to minimize the risk of infection. Muscle strain injuries in soccer players are both common and disabling.2 The adductor longus, rectus femoris and medial head of the gastrocnemius are the lower-limb muscles most prone to strain injury,3 and when injury does occur, it tends to occur at or near the myotendinous junction. In a laboratory study conducted to examine the mechanics and electrophysiology of muscle, Garret2 stretched muscles to failure from the proximal or distal tendons under the conditions of passive and active motion. Regardless of the rate of strain or type of muscle architecture, the muscle failed at the myotendinous junction, leaving a small, variable amount of muscle in continuity with the tendon. An earlier study by Garret et al4 also showed a tendency to rupture at the musculotendinous junction regardless of muscle structure and rate of passive stretch. The size, location and extent of the adductor tear are important because clinical management varies. Although adductor tears are often diagnosed and treated clinically, ultrasonography can be useful to assess the condition.5 A normal tendon exhibits a hyperechoic fibrillar structure when the ultrasound beam is projected perpendicular to the tendon and is thereby distinguished from muscle, which has a lower echogenicity. Painful sonolucent areas, combined with discontinuity of fibres, indicates partial rupture of the myotendinous junction.5 Complete tears present with retracted (hyperechoic) muscle, large hematomas and fascial tears. These features of myotendinous tears, such as retraction and thickening of the muscle belly associated with a large hematoma, were also described by Leekam et al,7 who used sonography to diagnose injury of the plantaris muscles and tendons.

TI  - Ultrasonography in the early diagnosis of psoriasis-associated enthesopathy
PY  - 2005
AB  - The aim of the present study was to detect entheseal abnormalities by means of ultrasonography (US) in patients with psoriasis. We evaluated 24 patients with psoriasis who underwent clinical and ultrasonographic examination of both lower limbs at the calcaneal insertions of the Achilles tendons and at the flexor and extensor tendons of all fingers of the hand. Fourteen patients with psoriatic arthritis were used as controls. US was performed using a real-time scanner (ATL SDI 3000) with a 5-12 MHz linear array transducer. Longitudinal and transverse scans of the talocrural joints, Achilles tendons and both the flexor and extensor tendons of the fingers of both hands were obtained at rest and during active and passive movements. On clinical examination no entheseal site was abnormal, but on US examination 33% of patients showed abnormalities. In particular, six psoriasis patients (25%) who were asymptomatic showed effusion around the extensor tendon of the first digit of the left hand and around the extensor tendon of the third and fourth digits of both hands; two patients (8.3%) showed a hypoechoic nodular formation of the flexor tendon sheath of the left hand. We conclude that entheseal abnormalities not detected at clinical examination were present in 33% of patients with psoriasis who underwent US examination. Therefore, we suggest the routine use of ultrasonography in the early diagnosis and in treatment and follow-up of patients with tendon enthesopathy, since these factors may have implications for therapy.

TI  - Ultrasonography-Guided Injection for Quadriceps Fat Pad Edema: Preliminary Report of a Six-Month Clinical and Radiological Follow-Up
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose: To investigate efficacy and safety of ultrasonography-guided local corticosteroid and anesthetic injection followed by physical therapy for the management of quadriceps fat pad (QFP) edema.Materials and Methods: We prospectively evaluated 1671 knee MRI examinations in 1542 patients for QFP edema with mass effect, which was present in 109 (6.5%) knees. Participants were assigned into injection and therapy groups (both received the same physical therapy program). Injection group was first treated with ultrasonography-guided QFP injection of 1 mL corticosteroid and 1 mL local anesthetic agent. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 1-, 2-, 6-month follow-up for pain using static and dynamic visual analogue scale (VAS), suprapatellar tenderness, and QFP edema on MRI.Results: Final sample size consisted of 19 knees (injection group, 10; therapy group, 9) in 17 patients. An overall improvement was detected in both groups between baseline and final assessments. The injection group fared better than the therapy group in static VAS scores (3.33 +/- 1.70 versus 0.56 +/- 1.33), while there was no such difference for dynamic VAS. Incidence of suprapatellar tenderness decreased in both groups, statistically significantly in the injection group (from 100% to 0%). Pain reduction was greater in the injection group at the first month (88.9%-90% good response versus 50%-66.7% good response, static-dynamic VAS scoring, respectively), whereas there was no such superiority at the sixth month. No severe adverse events were identified.Conclusion: Ultrasonography-guided local injection followed by physical therapy is safe in the management of QFP edema; however, it is not superior to stand-alone physical therapy program in the long term.

PY  - 2016
AB  - All bats use acoustic signals for passive listening to ambient sounds and for intra- and inter-species communication. In addition, most bats have evolved an active sonar system that uses calls for exploring the environment acoustically. In the majority of bats, the larynx produces these echolocation pulses. Echolocation is absent in the family of Old World fruit bats except for one genus, Rousettus, which “reinvented” echolocation by producing sonar pulses using tongue clicks. This chapter first discusses how sounds are produced by the bat larynx by outlining its characteristic morphological features and detailing general sound production mechanisms, including non-linear features that play a key role in enabling echolocating bats to switch between echolocation and communication sounds. Subsequently, details are presented on the neuronal basis for sound production in echolocating bats by briefly discussing the neural innervation pattern of the larynx and how this affects spectral and temporal features of sounds, followed by a summary of the neuronal connection patterns and mechanisms within the brain stem as well as in higher-order brain structures. The chapter then explores the role of various forms of sensory feedback in sound production, such as auditory and somatosensory stimulation, and highlights how sound production is intertwined with other motor patterns, such as flying. The chapter also briefly explores the diversity in the shape of nose leafs and pinnae in different species of echolocating bats and the role that dynamic changes of such facial characteristics may play in echolocation. Finally, the tongue-click echolocation in Rousettus is discussed.

TI  - Ultrasound Screening for Posterior Shoulder Dislocation in Infants with Persistent Brachial Plexus Birth Palsy
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Early detection of posterior shoulder dislocation in infants with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) is essential, but it may be difficult to accomplish with physical examination alone. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of shoulder dislocation in patients with BPBP using ultrasound and to identify which physical examination measurements correlated most with dislocation in these patients.Methods: This study was a retrospective review of data obtained in an ultrasound screening program of infants with BPBP born from January 2011 to April 2014. Physical examination included the use of the Active Movement Scale (AMS) and measurement of passive external rotation of the shoulder. Ultrasound measurements included PHHD (percentage of the humeral head displaced posterior to the axis of the scapula) and the alpha angle (intersection of the posterior scapular margin with a line tangential to the humeral head through the glenoid). Shoulder dislocation was defined as both a PHHD of >0.5 and an alpha angle of >30 degrees.Results: Of sixty-six infants who had undergone a total of 118 ultrasound examinations (mean, 1.8; range, 1 to 5), 19 (29%) demonstrated shoulder dislocation with the shoulder positioned in internal rotation; the dislocation was first detected between 2.1 and 10.5 months of age. Infants with a dislocated shoulder demonstrated significantly less mean passive external rotation in adduction (mean, 45.8 degrees versus 71.4 degrees, p < 0.001) and a greater difference between internal rotation and external rotation AMS scores (mean, 5.5-point versus 3.3-point difference, p < 0.001) than those without shoulder dislocation. Passive external rotation in adduction was a better measure for discriminating between dislocation and no dislocation (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.89) than was the difference between internal and external rotation AMS scores (AUC = 0.73). A cutoff of 60 degrees of passive external rotation in adduction (<= 60 degrees versus degrees >60) yielded a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 69%.Conclusions: Shoulder dislocation is common in infants with BPBP; 29% of the infants presenting to our tertiary care center had a dislocation during their first year of life. Ultrasound shoulder screening is appropriate for infants with BPBP. If passive external rotation in adduction is used to determine which infants should undergo ultrasound, <= 60 degrees should be utilized as the criterion to achieve appropriate sensitivity.

TI  - Ultrasound measurements of cavitation bubble radius for femtosecond laser-induced breakdown in water
PY  - 2008
AB  - A recently developed ultrasound technique is evaluated by measuring the behavior of a cavitation bubble that is induced in water by a femtosecond laser pulse. The passive acoustic emission during optical breakdown is used to estimate the location of the cavitation bubble's origin. In turn, the position of the bubble wall is defined based on the active ultrasonic pulse-echo signal. The results suggest that the developed ultrasound technique can be used for quantitative measurements of femtosecond laser-induced microbubbles. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America.

TI  - Ultrasound-derived changes in thickness of human ankle plantar flexor muscles during walking and running are not homogeneous along the muscle mid-belly region
PY  - 2019
AB  - Skeletal muscle thickness is a valuable indicator of several aspects of a muscle’s functional capabilities. We used computational analysis of ultrasound images, recorded from 10 humans walking and running at a range of speeds (0.7–5.0 m s−1), to quantify interactions in thickness change between three ankle plantar flexor muscles (soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius) and quantify thickness changes at multiple muscle sites within each image. Statistical analysis of thickness change as a function of stride cycle (1d statistical parametric mapping) revealed significant differences between soleus and both gastrocnemii across the whole stride cycle as they bulged within the shared anatomical space. Within each muscle, changes in thickness differed between measurement sites but not locomotor condition. For some of the stride, thickness measures taken from the distal-mid image region represented the mean muscle thickness, which may therefore be a reliable region for these measures. Assumptions that muscle thickness is constant during a task, often made in musculoskeletal models, do not hold for the muscles and locomotor conditions studied here and researchers should not assume that a single thickness measure, from one point of the stride cycle or a static image, represents muscle thickness during dynamic movements. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block for acute pain management in patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion under general anaesthesia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: The article dealt with evaluating the efficacy of bilateral single shot ultrasound-guided (US-guided) lumbar erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in patients scheduled for L3-L5 posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) under general anaesthesia (GA). The primary goal of the article was to determine total morphine consumption 24 hours postoperative. Secondary goals included determining total intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, length of post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, and complications.Methods: Sixty patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, aged 18-60 years, undergoing PLIF under GA were enrolled in this prospective, randomised, double-blinded study. Patients were randomised to 2 groups (30 patients each). Group I (control group) received GA only and group II received preoperative bilateral ESPB with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine. The primary outcome was postoperative morphine consumption. Secondary measurements were intraoperative fentanyl consumption, time to first analgesic request, static and dynamic visual analogue score (VAS), haemodynamic changes, PACU stay, and complications.Results: Patients who received ESPB showed a significant decrease in intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, shortened PACU stay, and haemodynamic stability compared to those who received GA only. Significant increase of VAS was observed in group I compared with group II up to 8 and 12 hours postoperative (static and dynamic VAS respectively).Conclusion: Preoperative bilateral single shot US-guided ESPB provided safe and effective postoperative analgesia for PLIF with reduced opioid consumption and short PACU stay.

AB  - New area of research, risk and catastrophe, whether they are of natural, technological, economical, or sanitary origin, never cease to worry people. Very complex, risk and disaster are the main focus of this paper. This complexity is generated notably by « domino effects », which emerge particularly during urban catastrophe. In this context, they are considered as essential by the majority of risks specialists. But in spite of this weight often granted to « domino effects » in urban environments, it seems that few models only really integrate them. Because system dynamics modelling allows the comprehension of this complexity, it has been retained to build models of risk and catastrophe. This has been implemented using Stella Research software which simulates stocks and flows equations. This modelling allowed on one side, to integrate the component « domino effect » in the disaster system, to overcome the fracture between nature and society ; on the other side it gave the possibility to surpass the static vision of phenomena and to privilege their study as dynamic systems. This communication proposes a model which simulates a very well known « domino effect » : motorists panic during flooding. First, the model is built. Then, we give a few simulation results concerning the Genoa urban area (Italy) during the swelling of the Bisagno river, on October 8, 1970. This model is one of the rare examples of the emergence of a « domino effect » in the field of urban catastrophe.

TI  - Uncalibrated dynamic eye-in-hand visual tracking of robots by observing unknown static objects
PY  - 2012
AB  - Uncalibrated visual servoing techniques based on the depth-independent interaction matrix framework have been proposed for the general 3D motion control of robot manipulators, which can simultaneously handle both the unknown intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. By extending the existing adaptive eye-in-hand visual servoing approach based on the depth-independent interaction matrix, in this paper, we propose an uncalibrated dynamic visual tracking approach for the eye-in-hand camera configuration by observing multiple feature points of a static object. The proposed approach can simultaneously handle the unknown camera parameters and the unknown 3D coordinates of the feature points, where a new adaptive law is developed to estimate these unknown parameters online. On the basis of nonlinear dynamics of robot manipulators, we also prove the asymptotic convergence of the image errors with the help of Lyapunov theory. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, preliminary simulation results will be given by using a two-link planar robot manipulator.

AB  - In this paper, an uncalibrated dynamic visual servoing algorithm is proposed and analyzed. No calibration or robot model is needed. After a brief introduction of the development of uncalibrated visual servoing, the theoretical backgrounds and mathematical requirements of Recursive Least Square (RLS) are stated respectively. Then the core uncalibrated visual servoing algorithm, in RLS form, or more technically, VS-RLS as well as its performance analysis, is investigated. After that, the experimental 6DOF Puma560 simulation of static and moving target tracking is demonstrated. Finally the weak and strength of the algorithm as well as the potential and promising improvements are discussed.

TI  - Uncertain Data Clustering Algorithm Based on Voronoi Diagram in Obstacle Space [障碍空间中基于Voronoi图的不确定数据聚类算法]
PY  - 2019
AB  - In order to solve the problem of the uncertain data clustering in obstacle space, the Voronoi diagram in computational geometry is introduced to divide the data space, and an uncertain data clustering algorithm based on Voronoi diagram in obstacle space is proposed. According to the properties of Voronoi diagram, four clustering rules are proposed. In order to consider the probability distribution between data, the KL distance is used as the similarity measure between data objects. Because obstacles can not always remain static in real life, and space obstacles often change dynamically. Then, according to whether the set of obstacles is changed, an uncertain data clustering algorithm in static obstacle environment and dynamic obstacle environment is proposed. Theoretical studies and experiments show that the uncertain refining clustering algorithm in the static obstacles environment(STAO_RVUBSCAN), the uncertain clustering algorithm of the dynamic increase of obstacles(DYNOC_VUBSCAN), the uncertain clustering algorithm of the dynamic reduction of obstacles(DYNOR_VUBSCAN) and the uncertain clustering algorithm of the dynamic movement of obstacles (DYNOM_VUBSCAN) have extremely high efficiency. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Under water passi ve acousti c monitoring & noise impa cts on marine fauna -a wor kshop report
PY  - 2013
AB  - The marine ecosystem is being increasingly subjected to underwater noise from industrial operations. Our ability to monitor the marine soundscape using passive acoustic technology is important to determine the potential impacts of anthropogenic sound. The objectives of this workshop were to define our current capabilities with regard to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM); to define our current state of knowledge of the marine soundscape, and of underwater noise in particular, and of noise impacts; to identify the needs and concerns of the various stakeholders; and to determine future research and development needs. The workshop was held in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 21 November 2012, the day before the Australian Acoustical Society's annual conference. Three tutorial sessions were presented by leading researchers in the field on underwater acoustic terminology, metrics, the basics of sound propagation, noise modelling and prediction, the marine soundscape (physical ambient, anthropogenic and biological sources), sound recording technology and methods, noise impacts on marine fauna, mitigation and environmental management. Tutorials were followed by rapid-fire presentations of current research associated with the themes of passive acoustic monitoring and noise impact. Discussions pursued on the presented topics, with emphasis on stakeholder needs, prevailing problems, knowledge gaps, potential solutions and future initiatives. The workshop was attended by over 70 participants from within Australia and abroad, hosting a diverse range of expertise and representing the various stakeholders in the marine environment: the offshore oil and gas industry, consulting industry, fishing industry, defence, government (environmental officers, regulators, fisheries officers), environmental groups and academia. The outcomes of the workshop were: . An appreciation of PAM for monitoring of marine fauna, for ecological studies, for measurements of anthropogenic noise, for studying noise impacts and for mitigation monitoring; . A demonstration of the effectiveness of PAM for presence and abundance monitoring (with more acoustic detections than visual in certain circumstances); . An understanding of the limitations of PAM (to vocalising animals) and the potential of combining PAM with visual observations and possibly active acoustic imaging to increase detection probability; . An appreciation of the differences between regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions; . The identification of the need to monitor (and address noise impacts on) entire ecosystems including less iconic (=nonmammalian) species; . The identification of knowledge gaps with regards to unidentified sounds in marine soundscapes, natural variability in soundscapes with space and time necessitating long-term baseline recording, noise impacts on the vast majority of marine species, anthropogenic source signatures and sound transmission.

TI  - Underestimation of large distances in active and passive locomotion
PY  - 2018
AB  - Our ability to estimate distances, be it verbally or by locomotion, is exquisite at close range (action space). At distances above 100 m (vista space), verbal estimates continue to be quite accurate, whereas locomotor estimates have been found to be grossly underestimated. Until now, however, the latter have been performed on a treadmill, which might not translate to real-world walking. We investigated if the motor underestimation found on the treadmill holds up in a natural environment. Observers viewed pictures of objects at distances between 10 and 245 m and were asked to reproduce these distances in a blindfolded walking task (using passive movement or an active production method). Active and passive locomotor judgments underestimated far distances above 100 m. We conclude that underestimation of large distances does not depend on the medium (treadmill vs. real-world) but rather on the sensory modality and effort involved in the task.

TI  - Understanding Sound: Auditory Skill Acquisition
PY  - 2017
AB  - Research on auditory perception often starts from an assumed theoretical framework of bottom-up acoustic signal decoding followed by pattern matching of signal information to memory. Some specific forms of auditory perception such as speech perception are often assumed to be mediated by specialized mechanisms, shaped by evolution to address the challenges of speech perception. However, neither of these broad approaches conceives of these systems as intrinsically adaptable and plastic; learning is typically considered as a separate process. This chapter addresses the question of auditory perceptual understanding and plasticity and argues that auditory perception, including speech perception, is an active cognitive process that incorporates learning. In contrast to a passive process in which patterns are mapped into memory in a direct comparative process, an active process forms hypotheses about pattern identity, and tests these hypotheses to adaptively shift attention to aspects of signal information. The process of hypothesis testing for signal understanding comes into play in cases of signal ambiguity or uncertainty, and involves auditory working memory and the control of attention. This conceptualization of adaptive processing incorporates context-sensitive change into the perceptual system. We argue that perception should be viewed not as a fixed instrument of information reception, but as a dynamic, adaptive system that is changed by the act of perception. We present evidence for these claims, outline a framework for a theory of active auditory perception, and argue further against claims of critical periods as biological determinism for perceptual plasticity given that auditory perception is auditory learning.

TI  - Understanding benthic, pelagic and airborne ecosystem interactions in shallow coastal seas.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Within the WestBanks project, we investigate interactions between sediment, water and air at the species and population level in the Western Coastal Banks area of the Belgian Part of the North Sea. This area was chosen because of its ecological importance for macrobenthos, fish and seabirds, which is reflected in its protection status by the Habitat and Bird Directive. We collect ecological data that should support a sound sustainable management of the area of the Western Coastal Banks. Our results reflected the importance of functional identity and densities of macrobenthic organisms for ecosystem functioning. Three key species for the Western Coastal Banks area, belonging to three different functional groups (e.g. Abra alba â“ biodiffuser, Lanice conchilega â“ piston pumper and Nephtys sp. â“ gallery diffuser) were incubated at different density levels (natural, lower and very low) in lab experiments, where bioturbation and ecosystem processes were measured. Benthic respiration, a proxy for mineralisation and hence ecosystem functioning was related to temperature, food availability, species identity and densities. Hence, a decline in species densities due to human disturbance will most probably result in a lowered level of ecosystem functioning. Each species has a different impact on the ecosystem functioning and hence a decrease of one functional group will not be counteracted for by another functional group. Lanice conchilega is shown to be a very important benthic organism in the area of the Western Coastal Banks since its presence in ambient densities doubled the nitrogen mineralisation rates compared to situations where it is absent. Moreover, our results showed that L. conchilega-patches classify as biogenic reefs in the framework of the Habitat Directive. The presence of L. conchilega in increased densities is linked with an increased diversity and densities of other macrobenthic organisms. We further showed that L. conchilega and its associated fauna are vulnerable to beam trawling activities. The molecular analyses of dispersal dynamics revealed that the distribution of L. conchilega results from large-scale dispersal events in the North Sea and local dispersal off Brittany. Similar research on sole (Solea solea) resulted in the development of markers discriminating between the temporal and the spatial scale. This made it possible to detect an exchange of populations throughout the year on the BPNS. This observation is new, and more samples will be processed in the second phase of WestBanks to validate this result. The modeling of the larval transport revealed that passive transport of larvae is influenced by local circumstances (e.g. passive transport is not the same at different places on the BPNS). Active vertical movements of larvae in the water column decrease the transport and horizontal dispersion of larvae as well, but again the effect of the active movements on the dispersion is site specific. This result in a low connectivity between the areas considered which might be the explanation for the presence of subpopulations of sole in the Eastern Channel and the southern North Sea. In order to assess the health of the pelagic ecosystem, we investigate whether marine top-predators (seabirds) can be used as indicators. In order to do so, there is a need to increase the knowledge of the links between these seabirds and their prey: pelagic fish. Therefore, pelagic fish was sampled in the Westdiep and the Wenduinebank, which are two key locations for seabirds. Both locations harboured different pelagic fish communities and energetically more favourable fish were encountered in the Westdiep. However, during the breeding season there was a higher availability of potential prey near the Wenduinebank. Research on foraging activities of terns revealed that the Wenduinebank is indeed a very important feeding ground for breeding terns. Both adult Common Terns and chicks feed on clupeid fish while adults also feed on polychaete worms (Nereidae). These nereids were also encountered in the faeces of Sandwich Tern suggesting the presence of this worm in the pelagic realm during restricted periods of the year. Adult Sandwich Terns feed on Ammodytidae, while Sandwich Tern chicks depend on the presence of suitable Clupeidae. Hence, changes in availability of clupeid fish of suitable size leads to a decrease in chick survival of both tern species. Prey length distribution may thus be a good candidate to serve as indicator for the health of the pelagic ecosystem

TI  - Understanding movement control in infants through the analysis of limb intersegmental dynamics
PY  - 1990
AB  - Analyzed limb intersegmental dynamics in spontaneous, cyclic leg movements (kicking) of varying intensity in 6 supine 3-mo-old human infants. In nonvigorous kicks, hip joint reversal was the result of an extensor torque due to gravity, opposed by the combined flexor effect of the active (muscle) torque and the total passive (motion-dependent) torque. Total motion-dependent torque increased as a hip flexor torque in more vigorous kicks; an extensor muscle torque was necessary to counteract the flexor influences of the total motion-dependent torque and, in the case of large ranges of motion, a flexor gravity torque as well. Smooth trajectories resulted from the muscle torque, counteracting and complementing not only gravity but also the motion-dependent torques generated by movement of the linked segments.

TI  - Understanding social interaction in children with autism spectrum disorders: Does whole-body motion mean anything to them?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background. - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and verbal and non verbal reciprocal communication. Face and gaze direction, which participate in non verbal communication, are described as atypical in ASD. Also body movements carry multiple social cues. Under certain circumstances, for instance when seeing two persons from far, they constitute the only support that allows the grasping of a social content. Here, we investigated the contribution of whole-body motion processing in social understanding.Objective. - The aim of the study was to evaluate whether children with ASD make use of information carried by body motion to categorize dynamic visual scenes that portrayed social interactions.Methodology. - In 1973, Johansson devised a technique for studying the perception of biological motion that minimizes static form information from the stimulus, but retains motion information. In these point-light displays, the movement figure, such as a body, is represented by a small number of illuminated dots positioned to highlight the motion of the body parts. We used Johansson's model to explore the ability of children with ASD to understand social interactions based on human movement analysis. Three-second silent point-light displays were created by videotaping two actors. The two actors were either interacting together or moving side by side without interacting. A large range of social interaction displays were used to cover social scenes depicting social norms (conventional gestures and courteous attitudes), emotional situations (carrying positive or negative valences) and scenes from games (sports, dance, etc.). Children were asked to carefully watch the stimuli and to classify them according to the question "Are the two persons communicating or not?". Four sessions of 3 minutes were performed by each child. Children with ASD were compared with typically developing control children matched with either non verbal mental age or chronological age. Response and reaction time were recorded in this force-choice categorization task.Results. - The performance of children with ASD suggested that they were able to extract a social content from body motion. However, they were significantly less efficient than typically developing control children, either matched for non verbal mental age or chronological age. This was especially the case for the social interaction displays. Neither impaired global perceptual processing, nor cognitive development, nor emotional content could explain these lower performances.Discussion and conclusion. - The results are discussed in the context of an action representation deficit and a dysfunction of the mirror mechanism in ASD. In conclusion, this behavioural study highlights the potential of point-light displays as a rehabilitation tool in ASD. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2011.

TI  - Understanding the relationship between marine mammals and their environment in the Bering Sea.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Passive aquatic listening (PAL) instruments were deployed on subsurface moorings along the 70-m isobath of the Bering Sea shelf. PALs operate according to an adaptive sampling protocol as opposed to recording continuously, thus enabling data collection for a full year at a sampling rate of 100 kHz. Year long time series indicate that marine mammal vocalizations dominate the regional soundscape in the late winter/early spring time period. Species acoustically identified include North Pacific right, killer, beluga, humpback, fin, and bowhead whales, plus bearded seal and walrus. Synoptic measurements of prey abundance with three-frequency active acoustic sensors, ice cover, and physical oceanographic processes provide vital information for understanding the relationship between marine mammals and their continually changing environment. These data represent important baseline measurements of environmental variability, marine mammal species richness, and temporal distribution of animals in an area of the world that is rapidly transforming due to global climate change.

TI  - Underwater Passive Acoustic Detection and Tracking for Waterside Surveillance
PY  - 2011
AB  - Surveillance of harbours, ports, and inland waters for protection against underwater intruders is a challenging problem. Active sonar can be employed for this purpose, but performance is limited in these reverberant waterside environments. Passive sonar is affected much less by reverberation and it can provide acoustic signatures for target classification. Furthermore, it is potentially a low cost solution and permits covert operation. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) is developing SOBEK – a passive sonar distributed sensor network for underwater surveillance. This paper provides an overview of the SOBEK system, recent achievements, and the future goals of the project. We present experimental results from a trial conducted in collaboration with Stevens Institute of Technology (USA) and SMID Technology (Italy), and with operational support from the Royal Netherlands Navy. The results demonstrate detection, localisation, classification, and tracking of divers and small surface vessels using the SOBEK system. Boat

TI  - Underwater Target Tracking Control of an Untethered Robotic Fish With a Camera Stabilizer
PY  - 2020
AB  - Implementing underwater target tracking remains difficult for a free-swimming robotic fish owing to the intrinsically reciprocating motion in fishlike propulsion. In this article, we present a novel robotic fish platform with a camera stabilizing system and achieve real-time two-dimensional target tracking assisted by reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous environments. More specifically, we first develop an active visual tracking system based on cascade control structure to obtain the relative orientation between the robotic fish and the underwater target. Then, we propose a target tracking controller dealing with continuous state and action spaces based on deep RL (DRL). The controller takes the position of the target object as input and yields the motion parameters of the bioinspired central pattern generator governed robotic fish. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed controller as well as the influence of time-delays on the control system are explored via simulated experiments under different scenarios. Finally, both static and dynamic tracking experiments on the actual robotic fish demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechatronic design and control methods, providing insights to executing aquatic vision-based tracking tasks.

TI  - Underwater behavior of sperm whales off Kaikoura, New Zealand, as revealed by a three-dimensional hydrophone array
PY  - 2013
AB  - Observations are presented of the vocal behavior and three dimensional (3D) underwater movements of sperm whales measured with a passive acoustic array off the coast of Kaikoura, New Zealand. Visual observations and vocal behaviors of whales were used to divide dive tracks into different phases, and depths and movements of whales are reported for each of these phases. Diving depths and movement information from 75 3D tracks of whales in Kaikoura are compared to one and two dimensional tracks of whales studied in other oceans. While diving, whales in Kaikoura had a mean swimming speed of 1.57 m/s, and, on average, dived to a depth of 427m (SD = 117 m), spending most of their time at depths between 300 and 600 m. Creak vocalizations, assumed to be the prey capture phase of echolocation, occurred throughout the water column from sea surface to sea floor, but most occurred at depths of 400-550 m. Three dimensional measurement of tracking revealed several different "foraging" strategies, including active chasing of prey, lining up slow-moving or unsuspecting prey, and foraging on demersal or benthic prey. These movements provide the first 3D descriptions underwater behavior of whales at Kaikoura. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Underwater non-lethal weapon based on principles of time reversal acoustics
PY  - 2011
AB  - Protection against surface and underwater threats from swimmers constitutes one of the most challenging aspects of port security. The envisioned risk mitigation consist of passive acoustic detection and localization and active diver deterrent, which can be done by focusing high intensity acoustic waves. The main goal of this study is to explore the possibility of using the Time Reversal Acoustics (TRA) sound focusing system for non-lethal swimmer neutralization. This breakthrough technology enables the precision targeting of a hostile diver with minimum impact to the marine environments. The acoustic noise radiated by the diver is used to focus the acoustic energy, while moving diver acts as an active self disclosing acoustic beacon. In a shallow water environment the radiated noise, direct and multi-path interference is rich and is exploited through the use of TRA. The effectiveness of the TRA focusing and the diver deterrence zone are modelled taking into consideration the frequency range, harbour depth, geometry of the transducer array. It is demonstrated that outside the focal region, the TRA system produces acoustic intensities that are not harmful for marine life. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Undulatory topographical waves for flow-induced foulant sweeping
PY  - 2019
AB  - Diverse bioinspired antifouling strategies have demonstrated effective fouling-resistant properties with good biocompatibility, sustainability, and long-term activity. However, previous studies on bioinspired antifouling materials have mainly focused on material aspects or static architectures of nature without serious consideration of kinetic topographies or dynamic motion. Here, we propose a magnetically responsive multilayered composite that can generate coordinated, undulatory topographical waves with controlled length and time scales as a new class of dynamic antifouling materials. The undulatory surface waves of the dynamic composite induce local and global vortices near the material surface and thereby sweep away foulants from the surface, fundamentally inhibiting their initial attachment. As a result, the dynamic composite material with undulating topographical waves provides an effective means for efficient suppression of biofilm formation without surface modification with chemical moieties or nanoscale architectures.

TI  - Uneven intervertebral motion sharing is related to disc degeneration and is greater in patients with chronic, non-specific low back pain: an in vivo, cross-sectional cohort comparison of intervertebral dynamics using quantitative fluoroscopy
PY  - 2018
AB  - Evidence of intervertebral mechanical markers in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is lacking. This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed.Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L2-S1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation.MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0.29 vs. 0.22, p = 0.02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1.40 vs. 0.92, p = 0.04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) and CDD (R = 0.70, p = 0.03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R = 0.77, p = 0.01) and CDD (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls.Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation.

TI  - Unfreezing the frozen shoulder
PY  - 1998
AB  - Frozen shoulder is a disorder of middle age that is particularly common in patients with diabetes. Underlying fibroplasia causes shrinking of the axillary portion of the glenohumeral capsule and thickening of the glenohumeral ligaments. The distinctive clinical presentation is of a shoulder that resists active and passive movement in all directions. Pain, particularly during extension and internal rotation, makes it difficult for the patient to reach up behind his or her back. In contrast, the pain of rotator cuff disease usually limits motion in only one or two planes. Management begins with local modalities and a consistent program of passive stretching exercises. Pain that persists calls for closed manipulation or arthroscopy to release the contracted capsule.

AB  - Injury or disease may damage the brain and lead to the socalled locked-in state in which no communication is possible. This non-responsive state may be due to a loss of consciousness such as seen in the vegetative state or complete motor paralysis as in the locked-in syndrome after stroke or as a consequence of a neurodegenerative disease. Phenomenologically, these patients look alike, however, their level of consciousness is quite different. Diagnosis in non-responsive patients relies mainly on overt motor behavior and is thus error-prone if patients are consciously aware, but unable to move. New paradigms on the basis of evoked potentials as measured with EEG and imagery and executive functioning as measured with fMRI provide the possibility to better determine the level of consciousness. Passive paradigms which require passive listening only may elucidate basic and higher cognitive function. Active paradigms which elicit a brain response only when subjects follow the respective task relevant command allow us to unequivocally conclude whether a patient is consciously aware. Braincomputer interface (BCI) provides the possibility to use the active brain response for simple yes-no communication. The challenge for detecting consciousness and communication with BCI is to deal with the altered brain responses in nonresponsive patients and the possibly short attention span, which necessitates short trial time and few repetitive stimulations within the mostly auditory paradigms. New developments in BCI that facilitate its use in daily life and improve reliability may facilitate communication when consciousness is detected.

TI  - Unmasking visual masking: A look at the "why" behind the veil of the "how"
PY  - 1980
AB  - Proposes theoretical integration of a mechanistic, causal analysis and behavioral analysis of visual masking phenomena. It is shown that several known aspects of visual masking are more adequately explained when a behavioral analysis complements a mechanistic analysis. Pertinent findings concerning the mechanisms of visual masking are presented and discussed in an evolutionary and functional context of naturalistic visual behavior characterized by the maintenance and changing of foveations required for visual inspection of static and dynamic visual scenes.

TI  - Unraveling interlimb interactions underlying bimanual coordination
PY  - 2005
AB  - Three sources of interlimb interactions have been postulated to underlie the stability characteristics of bimanual coordination but have never been evaluated in conjunction: integrated timing of feedforward control signals, phase entrainment by contralateral afference, and timing corrections based on the perceived error of relative phase. In this study, the relative contributions of these interactions were discerned through systematic comparisons of five tasks involving rhythmic flexion - extension movements about the wrist, performed bimanually (in-phase and antiphase coordination) or unimanually with or without comparable passive movements of the contralateral hand. The main findings were the following. 1) Contralateral passive movements during unimanual active movements induced phase entrainment to interlimb phasing of either 0 degrees (in-phase) or 180 ( antiphase). 2) Entrainment strength increased with the passive movements' amplitude, but was similar for in-phase and antiphase movements. 3) Coordination of unimanual active movements with passive movements of the contralateral hand ( kinesthetic tracking) was characterized by similar bilateral EMG activity as observed in active bimanual coordination. 4) During kinesthetic tracking the timing of the movements of the active hand was modulated by afference-based error corrections, which were more pronounced during in-phase coordination. 5) Indications of in-phase coordination being more stable than antiphase coordination were most prominent during active bimanual coordination and marginal during kinesthetic tracking. Together the results indicated that phase entrainment by contralateral afference contributed equally to the stability of in-phase and antiphase coordination, and that differential stability of these patterns depended predominantly on integrated timing of feedforward signals, with only a minor role for afference-based error corrections.

TI  - Unscented Kalman Filter for State and Parameter Estimation in Vehicle Dynamics
PY  - 2018
AB  - Automotive research and development passed through a vast evolution during past decades. Many passive and active driver assistance systems were developed, increasing the passen-gers' safety and comfort. This ongoing process is a main focus in current research and offers great potential for further systems, especially focusing on the task of autonomous and cooperative driving in the future. For that reason, information about the current stability in terms of dynamic behavior and vehicle environment are necessary for the systems to perform properly. Thus, model-based online state and parameter estimation have become important throughout the last years using a detailed vehicle model and standard sensors, gathering this information. In this chapter, state and parameter estimation in vehicle dynamics utilizing the unscented Kalman filter is presented. The estimation runs in real time based on a detailed vehicle model and standard measurements taken within the car. The results are validated using a Volkswagen Golf GTE Plug-In Hybrid for various dynamic test maneuvers and a Genesys Automotive Dynamic Motion Analyzer (ADMA) measurement unit for high-precision measurements of the vehicle's states. Online parameter estimation is shown for friction coefficient estimation performing maneuvers on different road surfaces.

TI  - Unsolicited online sexual material: What affects our attitudes and likelihood to search for more?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Sexually explicit information can be encountered through the Internet by both active exploration and passive means (e.g., junk mail, email and pop-ups). The present study examined unsolicited exposure to sexually explicit material through email, junk mail and pop-ups by assessing potential variables that might impact on positive attitudes towards such sexually explicit materials and the likelihood to search for them online. The findings support previously reported gender differences in attitudes and behaviour in relation to sexually explicit materials. Overall, males felt more positive toward online sexual content and were more likely to explore unsolicited emails and pop-ups than were females. Computer use for a variety of purposes (e.g., downloading files, communication, and entertainment) predicted positive attitudes towards unsolicited sexual pop-ups and junk mail messages while sheer number of hours spent on the computer predicted searching behaviour for sexual information. Domain-specific curiosity (i.e., curiosity toward online sexual material) positively predicted both positive attitudes and searching behaviours. Implications from this exploratory study are discussed.

TI  - Unsteady boundary layer measurement on an oscillating (pitching) supercritical airfoil in compressible flow using multiple hot-film sensors
PY  - 2015
AB  - Aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil in a dynamic motion are highly affected by the behavior of the viscous boundary layer. Boundary layer condition, and the related phenomena, depends on such different parameters as the oscillation type, flight Mach number, angle of attack, etc. In compressible and transonic regimes, the shock-boundary layer interaction causes complex phenomena such as -shock and separation bubble on the airfoil. When oscillation and unsteady effects are also added, a complicated flow is resulted which could not be easily investigated using theoretical and computational methods. Therefore, in this paper a series of static and dynamic (pitch) tests at pre stall angle of attacks were performed in a high speed wind tunnel to study the steady and unsteady behavior of the compressible boundary layer. Measurements involved pressure coefficient distribution and qualitative analysis of output voltage of hot films. Some sinusoidal pitching motions were performed on the SC (2)-0410 airfoil at Mach numbers of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 with the maximum Reynolds number of 8.8 million per meter. The effects of compressibility, reduced frequency, mean angle and oscillation amplitude and free stream Mach number were investigated. Results show asymmetry between transition and relaminarization during pitching motion, and delay in transition with respect to steady conditions. Also, the location of the shock, shock induced separation bubble, and their motions due to the change of instantaneous angle of attack were detected and interpreted using the outputs of hot-film sensors.

TI  - Unsupervised Video Action Clustering via Motion-Scene Interaction Constraint
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the past few years, scene contextual information has been increasingly used for action understanding with promising results. However, unsupervised video action clustering using context has been less explored, and existing clustering methods cannot achieve satisfactory performances. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised video action clustering method by using the motion-scene interaction constraint (MSIC). The proposed method takes the unique static scene and dynamic motion characteristics of video action into account, and develops a contextual interaction constraint model under a self-representation subspace clustering framework. First, the complementarity of multi-view subspace representation in each context is explored by single-view and multi-view constraints. Afterward, the context-constrained affinity matrix is calculated and the MSIC is introduced to mutually regularize the disagreement of subspace representation in scene and motion. Finally, by jointly constraining the complementarity of multi-views and the consistency of multi-contexts, an overall objective function is constructed to guarantee the video action clustering result. The experiments on four video benchmark datasets (Weizmann, KTH, UCFsports, and Olympic) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Unsupervised temporal segmentation of skeletal motion data using joint distance representation
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this paper, we present an online method for the unsupervised segmentation of skeletal motion capture data for the assessment of unfavorable or harmful postures in the context of musculoskeletal disorders. The long-time motion capture data is segmented into short motion sequences using joint distances of the captured skeleton. We use the difference between joint distance matrices to detect variances in motion dynamics in which the motion is separated into either a dynamic motion or a static posture. Then, the static posture can be evaluated using well-known posture assessment methods such as the Ovako Working postures Analysing System (OWAS) to derive risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. The algorithm works in real-time so that it can be incorporated in live warning systems for unfavorable or harmful postures. We evaluated the segmentation algorithm by comparing it with results from state-of-the-art offline motion segmentation algorithms as gold standard. Results show that the algorithm approaches the performance of state-of-the-art offline segmentation algorithms. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

TI  - Unusual stress fracture of the femoral neck in a young adult not caused by excessive stress: a case report
PY  - 2004
AB  - A 30-year-old man complained of a 10-day history of gradual onset of severe left leg pain. He did not have any history of trauma or excessive training. Routine laboratory data showed no abnormal findings. He was able to perform passive motions of the hip joint without pain, but active motion of the left hip joint was impossible due to anterolateral thigh pain. Plain radiographs of the hip showed no abnormal findings. However, bone scintigraphy indicated trace accumulation in the left femoral neck, and T-1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a linear low signal on the inferomedial aspect of the femoral neck. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 1.053 g/cm(2), which ruled out osteoporosis. The thigh pain was resolved 2 months after onset with conservative treatment, when plain radiographs showed sclerotic change and a reduction in the intensity of the low signal of T-1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Our diagnosis of unusual stress fracture indicates that the possibility of stress fractures without bone fragility should be kept in mind when young adults complain of atypical pain even without evidence of unusual activities.

TI  - Update on zone II flexor tendon injuries
PY  - 2014
AB  - Flexor tendon repair in zone II is particularly challenging because tendon gliding must be restored within a tight fibro-osseous sheath while minimizing the formation of adhesions in surrounding tissues. Meticulous surgical technique using a multistrand core suture and a peripheral suture is needed to produce a tendon that is strong enough to withstand early mobilization. Mechanical strength increaseswith the numberofstrands crossing the repair, regardless of the core suture configuration. Early mobilization after flexor tendon repair enhances the strength of the repair and decreases the risk of adhesions and joint stiffness. Satisfactory results have been achieved with either early passive or early active motion rehabilitation protocols; therefore, the choice of postoperative rehabilitation program is at the discretion of the surgeon. Factors such as repair integrity, concurrent injuries, and anticipated patient compliance should be considered in the decision-making process.

TI  - Updating of the spatial reference frame of head direction cells in response to locomotion in the vertical plane
PY  - 2013
AB  - Taube JS, Wang SS, Kim SY, Frohardt RJ. Updating of the spatial reference frame of head direction cells in response to locomotion in the vertical plane. J Neurophysiol 109: 873-888, 2013. First published October 31, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00239.2012.-Many species navigate in three dimensions and are required to maintain accurate orientation while moving in an Earth vertical plane. Here we explored how head direction (HD) cells in the rat anterodorsal thalamus responded when rats locomoted along a 360 spiral track that was positioned vertically within the room at the N, S, E, or W location. Animals were introduced into the vertical plane either through passive placement (experiment 1) or by allowing them to run up a 45 degrees ramp from the floor to the vertically positioned platform (experiment 2). In both experiments HD cells maintained direction-specific firing in the vertical plane with firing properties that were indistinguishable from those recorded in the horizontal plane. Interestingly, however, the cells' preferred directions were linked to different aspects of the animal's environment and depended on how the animal transitioned into the vertical plane. When animals were passively placed onto the vertical surface, the cells switched from using the room (global cues) as a reference frame to using the vertically positioned platform (local cues) as a reference frame, independent of where the platform was located. In contrast, when animals self-locomoted into the vertical plane, the cells' preferred directions remained anchored to the three-dimensional room coordinates and their activity could be accounted for by a simple 90 degrees rotation of the floor's horizontal coordinate system to the vertical plane. These findings highlight the important role that active movement signals play for maintaining and updating spatial orientation when moving in three dimensions.

AB  - The imaging techniques of the upper airway (UA) now permit a description of the characteristics of pharyngeal collapse during the course of obstructive apnoea. The start is oropharyngeal with active movements anteriorally and posteriorally of the soft palate and a Sailing back of the tongue. The extension occurs almost systematically towards the hypopharynx. A displacement of the hyoid bone and of the cervical spine is noted synchronously with thoracoabdominal movements. These imaging techniques of UA show the occurrence of passive pharyngeal collapse during certain types of central apnoea.In snorers and in apnoeics, there is a reduction of the calibre of the pharynx. However, these abnormalities are nor specific and do not enable the diagnosis to be confirmed nor an estimate of the severity of the sleep apnoea syndrome.Cephalometry and computed tomography of the pharynx should be carried out particularly when a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is envisaged. For practical purposes, the existence on cephalometry of retrognathism with an MP-H >24 mm and a PAS distance of <5 mm is associated with a poor result for UPPP. The same thing applies when macroglossia or a reduction of the surface of the hypopharynx is found on computed tomography.

TI  - Upper leg amputation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Amputation through the diaphysis of the femur at the most peripheral level possible. The stump, covered with soft tissue flaps, is free from pain. It can be fitted with a total contact prosthetic socket. The hip joint is preserved with its full range of motion.When no possibility to amputate at a more distal level through the tibia or the knee joint exists.When it is possible to amputate at a more distal level.Symmetrical flaps in the frontal plane are recommended. Asymmetrical flaps and flaps in the sagittal plane can also be made. Their muscles are fixed to each other (myodesis) or the bone end by means of transosseous sutures (myopexy). The ischial nerve has to be shortened about 2 inches proximal to the end of the femur.In peripheral vascular diseases, this procedure is not suitable. An alternative technique is suggested.In chronic osteomyelitis (e.g., after intramedullary nailing), the ventral half of the femur can be removed and the medullary cavity cleansed and filled with a muscular flap in order to maintain length. Lengthening procedures of the femur are discussed.Avoid active or passive movement of the stump for the first 2 weeks in order not to disturb healing of the muscle sutures. Physical therapy, prosthetic fitting after 4-6 weeks, according to the expected functional level 0-4. Aids: crutches, wheel chair, adjustable bed, modified hand-controlled automobile.The walking ability of a patient with a double amputation above the knee is severely limited and in patients with peripheral artery disease remains the exception.

TI  - Upper limb EMG artifact rejection in motor sensitive BCIs
PY  - 2011
AB  - Motor imagery-based brain computer interface (BCI) technology has motor rehabilitation as one of its main fields of application. The use of a BCI as a neuroprosthetic for paralyzed limb motor restoration implies normally absence of muscle activity. It is still an open question whether residual motor activity in healthy individuals or in patients causes a bias in the modulation of a motor imagery-based BCI control signal. Although the influence of electromyographical (EMG) activity in neck and cranial muscles upon BCI has been studied, not much has been said concerning the relevance of EMG activity arising from arm muscles. We therefore used a hand motor imagery-based BCI system paradigm designed for motor rehabilitation coupling a BCI with an online driven robotic orthosis to compare different EMG activity detection methods regarding their influence in the resulting analysis of neurophysiological signals. Fourteen healthy subjects underwent four sessions in which they were asked to perform motor imagery task alone (receiving no feedback), motor imagery with (visual and proprioceptive)feedback, active movement, passive movement and rest. Six different EMG feature extraction methods were calculated and three different data time windows were used for muscle activity threshold definition. Three different electrode spatial distributions were utilized for removing the EMG artifacts: a) coming from all the electrodes on the arms, b) just the ones placed on the imagery side and c) just the ones on the healthy arm. We compared the different EMG rejection methods by calculating the number of trials deemed artifact-free by each method. In this paper we demonstrate that different EMG artifact removal methods lead to distinct partitions of the total available data, thus yielding different influence of the method used to remove EMG artifacts on task related artifacts regarding number of trials contaminated and the differences in trials rejected using the different methods.

TI  - Upper limb H reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials modulated by movement
PY  - 2000
AB  - In the human lower limb, the magnitudes of both Hoffmann (H) reflexes and primary somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from scalp electrodes, are reduced by active and/or passive movement. We surmised that similar effects occur for the upper limb and specifically hypothesised that amplitudes of median nerve induced flexor carpii radialis H reflexes and cortical SEPs are reduced with passive movement about the wrist or elbow. The results showed (P<0.05) that either movement significantly attenuated mean magnitudes of SEPs elicited from stimulation at elbow or wrist and that reflex magnitudes attenuated with wrist movement. Thus, the upper limb shows similar movement-induced modulation to the lower limb. These attenuations of fast conducting sensory paths consequent to movement per se, may be a basic level of motor control, initiated from muscle mechanoreceptor discharge. Upon this basic level, more complex modulations then may be laid as appropriate for the particular characteristics of active motor tasks. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Upper limb edema postcerebellar stroke: A case report
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background & Hypothesis: Cerebellar infarction represents approximately 2% to 3% of acute strokes. Upper limb oedema often appears early after stroke but there is no evidence for a specific treatment for poststroke-induced upper limb oedema though several methods have been used in clinical practice such as arm elevation, encouraging active and passive movements, electric stimulation, pneumatic compressions. If not recognised, upper limb edema can slow down the rehabilitation process of the patient by causing discomfort, rigidity, decreased active movements and disuse. Method(s): We report a case of a 73-year-old man admitted to our institution with 2 weeks history of dizziness and functional decline. Examination was normal with no focal neurological deficits. Brain imaging showed acute left cerebellar infarct. Patient was noted to have left upper limb swelling (nonerythematous, non-tender, non-pitting) on second day of admission. Ultrasound doppler done of left upper limb was normal with no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Patient underwent regular physiotherapy inpatient along with elevation of arm and encouraging active + passive movements of his arm. Result(s): His left arm swelling gradually improved and was fully resolved after 2 weeks of admission. Discussion & Conclusion(s): Upper limb edema is commonly seen with hemiplegic strokes but is less recognised in cerebellar stroke. Although the patient does not demonstrate classical limb weakness in cerebellar stroke, physiotherapy is essential to prevent edema which may hinder the general patient recovery after the stroke. From our review of available information, we found that postcerebellar stroke edema has received insufficient attention and more research studies need to be done on this subject.

TI  - Upper limb loading in elbow flexor spastic dystonia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background.- Studies have demonstrated reduction of spastic dystonia with sustained stretch. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of upper limb wrist-worn loading in a patient with elbow flexor spastic dystonia. Methods.- A 53-year old male with left spastic hemiparesis secondary to a cerebral infarct 2 years prior has benefited from a 3-month rehabilitation program, including botulinum toxin injections at the Neurorehabilitation Day Hospital in Albert-Chenevier hospital, Créteil, France. Within this program the patient has worn a loaded wrist splint (1.5 kg) daily. Every day, he reported the total loading time together with any untoward effects in a diary. Once monthly we monitored spasticity with the Tardieu Scale and active arm function with the Modified Frenchay Scale using blinded review by two examiners. Results.- Maximal range of passive motion against the elbow flexors (XV1) increased from 144° to 164° (+20°), angle of catch (XV3) from 92° to 116° (+24°) and active motion range (A) from 78° to 92° (+14°). Regarding active limb function, score improved by 1/10 point for three tasks involving active elbow extension. Conclusion.- Upper limb loading may be of benefit in hemiparesis to reduce elbow flexor spastic dystonia and improve functionality.

TI  - Upper limb robotic rehabilitation
PY  - 2013
AB  - There are a lot of robotic devices for upper extremities rehabilitation available on the market. Some device will be presented and their technological specification will be discussed in order to try to establish which devices could be useful for stroke patients rehabilitation. System must be active: passive system can be useful only in mild impaired stroke patient which often have not special needs. System must assist as needed: System must recognize subject's active movements, partially performed also, and leave the patient free to move. It must help subject to finish the movement driving trajectories (proprioceptive feedback) They have to provide a very low impedance when the system does not work Trunk fixation should be provided in order to stimuli arm movement avoiding trunk's compensation Moreover an overall classification of robotic devices could include: Passive vs active; low impedance vs high impedance and systems working on the end effector vs systems able to control all joints during the movement (exo-skeletal). A comparison between the end effector systems and exoskeletal devices should be very interesting in order to try to clarify which kind of devices is more effective and if there is a difference regarding the upper and lower limb treatment. At the movement few study on the comparison between difference devices are available in the literature and among them no study has been carried out on the comparison between different devices for the upper limbs robotic rehabilitation. Recent systematic reviews showed that upper limb robot-assisted rehabilitation treatments in stroke subjects improve short- and long-term motor control, even if no consistent influence on functional abilities1,2 and participation, based on the International Classification of Functioning framework, was found. Evidence of better results providing intensive treatments, both robotic and conventional rehabilitative techniques, was recently reported.3 Several studies on robot-assisted rehabilitation treatment in chronic stroke patients have shown a reduction of the upper limb impairment, but till now evidence on the advantage of using robotic therapy compared to other types of intervention (i.e., electrical stimulation) is still lacking4, even if robotic therapy can provide safe and intensive training able to improve upper limb coordination and function.5 Till now only few studies have investigated the effects of robotic therapy on subacute patients6-10 and even fewer involve the upper limb distal joints, such as wrist and hand. A large study on chronic stroke patients, involving 127 patients, did not found any difference between the group treated by robotic device and the group treated by intensive usual care, supposing that the key point for a better outcome could be intensity and not linked to specific features of treatment provided by robotic devices, such as repeatability. Our experience, by using two robotic devices for shoulder, elbow and wrist rehabilitation will be presented. Obviously the devices are active, assist as needed with low impedance and trunk fixation. In particular we have carried out some studies on chronic stroke patient and sub-acute stroke patients. A comparison between chronic and sub-acute patients has been provided resulting very interesting in order to better understand the difference in mechanisms of recovery. For the patients evaluation not only clinical scales have been used, but some kinematic parameters also have been directly extracted by robotic device. Furthermore some prototypical new robotic devices, which are going to be developed in collaboration with bioengineers will be also presented together with some preliminary results on the use of very low cost system, usually used for the videogames. In conclusion robotic systems deliver an intensive and repetitive treatment which can be physically exhausting for a physiotherapist. Robotic therapy could be delivered both in chronic and subacute patients, even if the real cost-effectiveness ratio for the healthcare system. Robotic devices are not rigid, they can be flexible and interfaced with other devices as EEG or EMG. The possibility to tailor the treatment to each group of patients, is an added value of robotic systems for rehabilitation. The recording of kinematic and kinetic parameters can represent useful markers for quantifying the motor recovery process of each patient and for better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the motor recovery after a neurological damage.

TI  - Urban Greening and Its Role in Fostering Human Well-Being
PY  - 2017
AB  - Population growth coupled with urbanisation has led to a decline in natural ecosystems throughout the world. Particularly in cities, urban developments continue to displace natural ecosystems and lead to cities being dominated by concrete and steel. However, with increasing recognition of the benefits of human interaction with nature, planning and design professionals are now making more deliberate attempts to introduce greenery into the built environment. Indeed, the fields of urban planning, public health, and park planning provide a rich account of the role that urban greening plays in human well-being. History of urban planning and greenspace began in Europe and America in the early 1800s. Early park settings were intended to benefit urban dwellers and factory workers who lacked exposure to clean air and greenery, whereas today planners develop green recreation areas for passive and active leisure pursuits. An interesting programme that started in the United States is 'Park Prescriptions', which is 'designed in collaboration with healthcare providers and community partners to utilise parks, trails, and open space for the purpose of improving individual and community health'. Horticultural therapy is another compelling initiative which promotes greater inclusion of greenery and active movement within healthcare settings, both inside buildings and the nearby environment. In such initiatives, park planners and managers work closely with urban planners and neighborhood developments to enhance access and leisure services in order to maximise associated physical and mental health and social benefits.

TI  - Usage of ITS in the In-vehicle Signing System With RFID tags and Vehicle Routing and Road Traffic Simulation
PY  - 2008
AB  - Vehicle drivers are requested to collect dynamic visual information on such matters as other vehicles and traffic signals, and static visual information including traffic signs, and to maneuver the vehicle accordingly. However, traffic signs and other static visual information are more likely to he overlooked than dynamic visual information during maneuver. In this study, an in-vehicle signing system was built and assessed that uses general-purpose RFID tags as digital traffic signs, and a field test was conducted using tags installed on a road to verify whether the system worked effectively or not. A laboratory test was also carried out using a video of vehicle travel to have subjects experience maneuver. Then, it was found that providing visual and vocal information in the vehicle was effective. And In-vehicle navigation permits people to find their way while driving. Combining these applications with road traffic data may result in diminishing traveling time. In this paper we deal with the problem of vehicle routing on today's congested roads. The result of this study is a web application that provides the user with two possibilities.

TI  - Use of Automated passive acoustic monitoring methods for monitoring for marine mammals in conjunction with US Navy Mid-frequency Active Sonar training events
PY  - 2013
AB  - Automated passive acoustic detection, classification, and localization (DCL) methods are employed to deal with large volumes of acoustic data to support estimating the sound pressure levels (SPLs) that marine mammals are exposed to from mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS) during US Naval training events. These methods are applied to a training event involving MFAS conducted February 2012 in Hawaiian waters with thirty one hydrophones of data collected continuously over an 11 day period. The automated methods detect and determine locations of marine mammals, specifically minke and beaked whales, and the times of the MFAS transmissions utilizing custom C + + algorithms. Streamlined manual validation methods are employed which utilize custom MATLAB display routines. Animal locations uncertainties are addressed for the two different species. Once the transmitting ship and animal locations are determined acoustic propagation modeling is utilized to estimate the sound pressure levels (in dB re 1 micro Pascal) that an animal, or group of animals, were exposed to. Surface ducted propagation conditions can result in species such as beaked whales being exposed to over 30 dB higher SPL’s when they return to the surface to breathe compared to when at depth foraging.

TI  - Use of Commercial Virtual Reality Technology to Assess Verticality Perception in Static and Dynamic Visual Backgrounds
PY  - 2020
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) test and the closely related Rod and Disk Test (RDT) are measures of perceived verticality measured in static and dynamic visual backgrounds. However, the equipment used for these tests is variable across clinics and is often too expensive or too primitive to be appropriate for widespread use. Commercial virtual reality technology, which is now widely available, may provide a more suitable alternative for collecting these measures in clinical populations. This study was designed to investigate verticality perception in symptomatic patients using a modified RDT paradigm administered through a head-mounted display (HMD). DESIGN: A group of adult patients referred by a physician for vestibular testing based on the presence of dizziness symptoms and a group of healthy adults without dizziness symptoms were included. We investigated degree of visual dependence in both groups by measuring SVV as a function of kinematic changes to the visual background. RESULTS: When a dynamic background was introduced into the HMD to simulate the RDT, significantly greater shifts in SVV were found for the patient population than for the control population. In patients referred for vestibular testing, the SVV measured with the HMD was significantly correlated with traditional measures of SVV collected in a rotary chair when accounting for head tilt. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial proof of concept evidence that reliable SVV measures in static and dynamic visual backgrounds can be obtained using a low-cost commercial HMD system. This initial evidence also suggests that this tool can distinguish individuals with dizziness symptomatology based on SVV performance in dynamic visual backgrounds.

TI  - Use of Dispersive Delay Lines for Signal Processing in Underwater Acoustics
PY  - 1969
AB  - Signal processors incorporating dispersive delay lines can be designed for matched filters in active sonars, for spectrum analyzers in passive listening, and for generators of frequency modulated codes. Depending upon its bandwidth and its duration, the signal to be processed is fed into a dispersive delay line that is matched to it in the case of wide band systems, or matched to an homothetic signal (a signal having the same modulation characteristics, the same time bandwidth product as the original signal, but having a frequency scale multiplied or divided by a factor k and a time scale divided or multiplied by the same factor k) with a larger bandwidth in the case of narrow band systems. In this last case, the signal is previously time compressed with an appropriate unit, such as a recirculating memory or a magnetic recorder. © 1969, Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Use of Human-Altered Habitats by Bull Sharks in a Florida Nursery Area
PY  - 2013
AB  - Bull Sharks Carcharhinus leucas in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, have been documented to frequently occur in human-altered habitats, including dredged creeks and channels, boat marinas, and power plant outfalls. The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term movements of age-0 and juvenile Bull Sharks to quantify the extent to which those movements occur in altered habitats. A total of 16 short-term active acoustic tracks (2-26h) were carried out with 9 individuals, and a 10th individual was fitted with a long-term coded transmitter for passive monitoring by fixed listening stations. Movement and activity space statistics indicated high levels of area reuse over the span of tracking (hours to days). All but one shark used altered habitat at some point during tracking, such that 51% of all tracking positions occurred in some type of altered habitat. Of the sharks that used altered habitat, the mean (1 SD) percent of positions within altered habitat was 66 (+/- 40)%. Furthermore, tracks for 3 individuals indicated selection for altered habitats. The single passively monitored Bull Shark was detected in power plant outfalls almost daily over a 5-month period, providing the first indication of longer-term fidelity to thermal effluents. Use of one dredged creek was influenced by local salinity, the tracked sharks dispersing from the altered habitat when salinity declined. The affinity of young Bull Sharks to altered habitats in this system could help explain their reported accumulation of a variety of harmful contaminants, which could negatively affect their health and survival.

TI  - Use of Yellow-Tinted Soft Contact Lenses and Visual Functions and Batting Performances in College Baseball Players.
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the influence of the use of yellow-tinted soft contact lenses on visual functions and batting performance among college baseball players. The subjects were 12 college baseball players (mean age 19.9±1.5 years, mean athletic career 10.0±1.9 years). The criteria used to measure visual function, which is important for playing baseball, were static visual acuity, kinetic visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, depth perception, contrast sensitivity, and low-contrast visual acuity. Moreover, batting and bunt tests were performed to measure batting performance. Subjects measured these items with yellow-tinted and sport soft contact lenses in a random order on the same day. In terms of visual functions, there were no significant differences between the yellow-tinted and sport soft contact lenses. In addition, there were no significant differences in batting performance tests. Analysis of the subjective symptoms confirmed that the use of the yellow-tinted soft contact lenses improved symptoms, such as light aversion, better than the sport soft contact lenses in the majority of the subjects. Furthermore, none of the subjects experienced any adverse effects in batting performance from use in either the batting or bunt tests. Thus, it is suggested that the use of yellow-tinted soft contact lenses does not, at the very least, adversely affect the visual functions and batting performances in college baseball players. The report of the subjective symptoms also suggested that the use of yellow-tinted soft contact lenses may be useful for baseball players. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

TI  - Use of a bicycle ergometer for limb position sense testing during a cyclic lower limb task
PY  - 2003
AB  - Patients with neurologic impairments are tested for proprioceptive deficits using static or quasi-static techniques that are not applied within the context of a functional movement task. This study was conducted to determine if limb position sense LPS testing can be reliably measured during a dynamic cyclic task eg, pedaling and whether the accuracy of LPS will be affected by movement and is phasedependent. Experiments were performed with 16 young adult subjects. Subjects pedaled a bicycle ergometer while attempting to identify when their foot traveled through a specified target region. Errors were measured when they incorrectly identified that their foot was in a region outside of the target. Subjects were tested in active versus passive versus static modes, eyes-open versus eyes-closed, and at each of 7 target regions. The LPS test showed high reliability ICC 1,1 ranged from 0.86 to 0.98. Passive movement resulted in the least errors. During active movement, transition regions had the least errors and the mid-downstroke region had the most errors. Therefore LPS, tested during pedaling, was reliable and revealed movement and phasedependent position sense. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

TI  - Use of a non-medicated plaster in shoulder tendinopathies.
PY  - 2016
AB  - We assessed 20 shoulders with rotator cuff tendinopathy and partial tendon tears treated with FIT plasters (far infrared technology). The criteria for inclusion were pain at night and during active shoulder movement. Patients with restricted passive movement (adhesive capsulitis) and complete tendon tears were excluded. Two different types of FIT plasters were used according to the different power of action. Plasters were replaced after 7 days and dismissed after 15 days. The patients were assessed using the VAS pain scale and the Constant Murley score for function. The use of FIT plasters have shown a certain effectiveness in activation of the endogenous analgesic action, with a role in alleviate painful symptoms and improve function in rotator cuff tendinopathies, without adverse events. On the base of the safety of this technology and promising results of our study, further studies should be encouraged to confirm its effectiveness, increasing the sample number and follow up so as to demonstrate definitely that the use of technologies, on which FIT plasters is based, may be a valid alternative as "non-medicated pain relief".

TI  - Use of a relative motion flexion orthosis for postoperative management of zone I/II flexor digitorum profundus repair: Aretrospective consecutive case series.
PY  - 2019
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center, consecutive case series.INTRODUCTION: In concept, a relative motion flexion (RMF) orthosis will induce a "quadriga effect" on a given flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, limiting its excursion and force of flexion while still permitting a wide range of finger motion. This effect can be exploited in the rehabilitation of zone I and II FDP repairs.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To describe the use of RMF orthoses to manage zone I and II FDP 4-strand repairs.METHODS: Medical record review of 10 consecutive zone I and II FDP tendon repairs managed with RMF orthosis for 8 to 10 weeks in combination with a static dorsal blocking or wrist orthosis for the initial 3 weeks.RESULTS: Indications included sharp lacerations (n=6), ragged lacerations (n=2), staged flexor tendon reconstruction (n=1), and type IV avulsion (n=1). In 8 of the 10 cases that completed follow-up, the mean arc of proximal interphalangeal/distal interphalangeal active motion were as follows: sharp, 0° to 106°/0° to 75°; ragged, 0° to 90°/0° to 25°; reconstruction, 0° to 90°/10° to 45°; and avulsion, 0° to 95°/0° to 20°. Grip performance available for 6 of 10 cases was 62% to 108% of the dominant hand. There were no tendon ruptures, secondary surgeries, or proximal interphalangeal joint contractures.CONCLUSION: Based on this small series, the RMF approach appears to be safe and effective. It can lead to similar mobility and functional recovery as other early active motion protocols, with certain practical advantages and without major complications. Further investigation with larger, multicenter, prospective, longitudinal cohorts and/or randomized clinical trials is necessary.

TI  - Use of active sonar for cetacean conservation and behavioral-ecology studies: A paradox?
PY  - 2009
AB  - The relationship between low frequency military sonar use and some whale stranding events has attracted negative attention towards the use of active sonar in the marine environment. As a consequence, there has been only limited use of active acoustic techniques by marine mammal researchers. Instead more attention has been given to the development and use of passive acoustic methods for the detection of cetaceans. Nevertheless there is great potential for the use of active acoustic systems in ecological studies, and studies aimed at improving conservation of whales and dolphins in their natural environment: active acoustic techniques can be used for the good of cetaceans, and should not just be considered a source of disturbance. We evaluated the capability of various acoustic systems - systems that are used commonly in fisheries research - to detect and track cetaceans underwater. We collected data initially with standard scientific echosounders (SIMRAD EK500) from moving vessels and from fixed moorings (EK60) at 38 and 120 kHz. Scientific echosounders have narrow beams and therefore enable sampling from only fixed and limited volumes. To overcome these limitations we progressed to use high frequency omnidirectional sonar (SIMRAD SH80) operating at 110 kHz. During Norwegian Sea ecosystem surveys (2006-2008) we recorded the backscatter energy from three species of large whales: Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeanglie). During the observations no avoidance reactions by cetaceans were observed, even when the vessel's entire suite of active acoustic instruments were running (frequency range from 18 kHz to 200 kHz, maximum source level 210 dB re 1 μPa (at 20 and 110 kHz). Here we present a small sample of data from two Fin whales that show the animals backscatter response at broadside. In addition, we give an overview of the present status and possible future development of the use of standard active acoustic methods for cetacean studies. Omnidirectional sonar shows great potential as a tool for marine mammal detection, and could be developed to produce an automatic cetacean detector. Such a detector would be a highly valuable aid for seismic mitigation and ship strike prevention, and in addition could contribute to behavioural studies with its high definition time scale. Much work is required to understand relationships between cetacean body shape, physiology, kinematics and acoustic reflectivity, before a detector can be realized.

TI  - Use of an animal-borne active acoustic tag to conduct minimally-invasive behavioral response studies
PY  - 2013
AB  - A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the potential of animal-borne active and passive acoustic tags for conducting minimally-invasive behavioral response studies on pinnipeds. A prototype tag was developed and tested on juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) using translocation experiments at Año Nuevo State Park, CA, USA, in spring 2012. The principal scientific questions of this pilot study were (1) do low-intensity sounds emitted by an animal-borne tag elicit behavioral responses, and (2) are potential animal responses related to signal content (e.g., threatening vs non-threatening)? Preliminary results indicate that (1) low-intensity sounds emitted by animal-borne tags elicit distinct behavioral responses, (2) these responses appear related to signal content, and (3) the responses may differ based on depth, bathymetry, and location. The results of the study show the promise of this approach as a minimally invasive and cost-effective method to investigate animal responses to underwater sounds, as well as a method to develop mitigation strategies. We are currently in the process of improving the tag design for future field efforts with the goal to increase the sample size, range of acoustic stimuli, and age/sex classes of tagged seals.

TI  - Use of an estuarine environment (Barra do Sai lagoon, Brazil) as nursery by fish
PY  - 2006
AB  - Studies were carried out at the Barra do Sai lagoon, on the northern coast of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, to evaluate the function played by this estuary in the life cycle of fish found at the coastal zone. Samplings were performed using beach seine net from December 2000 to November 2001. The continental influence is strong, as showed by the occurrence of freshwater fishes, although most of the 43 species recorded are marine ones. It was verified that around summer, when the temperature of the water is high, the values of salinity decrease and those of turbidity increase. At this time there is also an increase in the abundance of juvenile fish in the lagoon. Because of its average depth of less than 0.7 m, the lagoon is inhabited primarily by juveniles, which may enter either by active movement or passive displacement, originating from the sea or the river to which the lagoon is connected. The lagoon is not used for sheltering spawning individuals. It is showed that a shallow, small estuary with a blind bottom can conceal an importance for the coastal ichthyofauna that is greater than it could be expected from the occurrence - in this case, modest - of large individuals.

It was verified that around summer, when the temperature of the water is high, the values of salinity decrease and those of turbidity increase. At this time there is also an increase in the abundance of juvenile fish in the lagoon. Because of its average depth of less than 0.7 m, the lagoon is inhabited primarily by juveniles, which may enter either by active movement or passive displacement, originating from the sea or the river to which the lagoon is connected. The lagoon is not used for sheltering spawning individuals. It is showed that a shallow, small estuary with a blind bottom can conceal an importance for the coastal ichthyofauna that is greater than it could be expected from the occurrence - in this case, modest - of large individuals.

TI  - Use of continuous passive motion after total knee arthroplasty
PY  - 2001
AB  - Sixty primary total knee arthroplasties in 43 Chinese patients were included into a prospective study. Twenty-six patients who had unilateral knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive continuous passive motion (CPM) or immobilization in the first week. The 2 groups of patients were comparable in demographic data and preoperative knee range of motion (ROM). In 17 patients who had 1-stage sequential bilateral arthroplasties, one side had CPM and the other side was immobilized. The active knee ROM was assessed regularly until 1 year after the operation. For all patients, the early active knee ROM in the CPM group was significantly better than the immobilization group. There was no difference after 7 days, however. For patients who had 1-stage bilateral total knee arthroplasties, the active knee ROM was significantly better on the CPM side until day 28. After 4 weeks, there was no difference between the CPM group and the immobilization group. Immobilization after total knee arthroplasty does not preclude good ROM.

TI  - Use of duplex sonography to investigate the effect of active and passive movement at the ankle joint for promoting venous return.
PY  - 1995
AB  - Among the joint and muscle pumps that are hemodynamically active and, in particular, bring about venous return in the lower limb, the so-called ankle pump is of paramount importance. The basic anatomical relationship of the talocrural joint to the venous network around the ankle is reviewed. Duplex sonographic measurement of the rate of blood flow in the great saphenous vein at the saphenous opening, at rest and during active and passive movements at the ankle joint, shows that such movements have an important effect on the rate of flow through the adjacent veins. Passive movement of the foot relative to the leg was brought about by a newly developed apparatus that can be either pneumatically or electrically operated. The action of the ankle pump against venous stasis, the arthrogenic congestive syndrome, and chronic venous insufficiency has demonstrated the prophylactic importance of this physiological mechanism. It can, when necessary, be replaced by an appropriately designed apparatus.

TI  - Use of feedback in scheduling parallel computations
PY  - 1997
AB  - This paper discusses the use of run-time feedback for optimizing the execution of parallel computations. Four levels of feedback are distinguished, and the applicability and limitations of each are discussed. A two-part scheduling paradigm known as SEDIA (Static Exploration/Dynamic Instantiation and Activation) that addresses these limitations to perform robust scheduling in the presence of variant run-time behavior is introduced. A key component of this scheduling paradigm is an abstract model of run-time information fidelity, which has evolved from our previous work in the area of Trace Recovery, employing control-theoretic concepts.

TI  - Use of micro-computed tomography to evaluate the effects of exercise on preventing the degeneration of articular cartilage in tail-suspended rats
PY  - 2015
AB  - Space flight has been shown to induce bone loss and muscle atrophy, which could initiate the degeneration of articular cartilage. Countermeasures to prevent bone loss and muscle atrophy have been explored, but few spaceflight or ground-based studies have focused on the effects on cartilage degeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of exercise on articular cartilage deterioration in tail-suspended rats. Thirty-two female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 in each): tail suspension (TS), tail suspension plus passive motion (TSP), tail suspension plus active exercise (TSA), and control (CON) groups. In the TS, TSP, and TSA groups, the rat hindlimbs were unloaded for 21 days by tail suspension. Next, the cartilage thickness and volume, and the attenuation coefficient of the distal femur were evaluated by micro-computed tomography (mu CT). Histological analysis was used to assess the surface integrity of the cartilage, cartilage thickness, and chondrocytes. The results showed that: (1) the cartilage thickness on the distal femur was significantly lower in the TS and TSP groups compared with the CON and TSA groups; (2) the cartilage volume in the TS group was significantly lower compared with the CON, TSA, and TSP groups; and (3) histomorphology showed that the chondrocytes formed clusters where the degree of matrix staining was lower in the TS and TSP groups. There were no significant differences between any of these parameters in the CON and TSA groups. The cartilage thickness measurements obtained by mu CT and histomorphology correlated well. In general, tail suspension could induce articular cartilage degeneration, but active exercise was effective in preventing this degeneration in tail-suspended rats.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Basis: Rehabilitation of spastic paresis after the stroke requires complex approach to the therapy, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and other disciplines that significantly influence the quality of life of patients (Hoskovcová et. al, 2014). Therapy of spastic paresis according to Jean-Michel Grades concept should include combination of progressive prolonged static stretching elements as well as intensive motor training (Sádlová, Dvořáková, Řiha, 2016). Methods: Part of therapy of spastic paresis after the stroke with static progressive prolonged stretching is described in this article. Way of therapy is presented by the case study with the use of JAS orthosis (Joint active system orthosis) within four-day inpatient rehabilitation and subsequent four-week home autotherapy. Results: Improvements of Frenchay Modified Scale of 29 points was observed after the therapy. Patient was improves according to Tardieu Scale for spasticity assessment in five segments, improved passive motion of paretic upper limb measured by the goniometer was observed in ten segments. Active motion was also improved, in eight segments. Conclusion: Use of static progressive prolonged stretching of upper limb in patients with spastic paresis after the stroke is described in this case report. System of stretching with the use of JAS orthosis is possible within the inpatient stay, as well as in home based autotherapy.

TI  - Use of passive hearing protectors and adaptive noise reduction for field recording of otoacoustic emissions in industrial noise
PY  - 2013
AB  - Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPO AEs) can detect noise-induced hearing loss in-field, but their data extraction is very sensitive to background noise. This paper investigates how passive and active noise reduction enhance DPOAE recording based on data collected in white noise from 54dB(A) to 90dB(A). Despite considerable high-frequency attenuation from a proper placed DPOAE probe, 54dB(A) background noise deteriorates the test outcome substantially. More low-frequency attenuation by an extra passive earmuff enables measurements in white noise levels of 70dB(A). The relationship between external sound level and noise recorded by the DPOAE system has been statistically modeled. Additionally, the upper limits of attenuation improvement are analyzed by quantifying residual physiological noise. Furtermore, for an earplug integrating microphone and speakers of the DPOAE measurement probe, adaptive noise reduction processing on the DPOAE signal is used to improve the Signal-to-Noise ratio. The adaptive noise reduction (ANR) is implemented using the NLMS algorithm to filter out the ambiant noise, measured by the first microphone measuring the DPOAE signal, with a second miniature microphone mounted flush with the external faceplate of the isolating DPOAE probe. Simulated data shows that DPOAE response extraction is possible in an environment with noise levels exceeding 70dB(A). © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Use of self‐report activities of daily living questionnaires in osteoarthritis
PY  - 1988
AB  - Self‐report activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaires and traditional observer‐reported physical measures were used to assess clinical status in a clinical trial involving patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The observer‐reported measures included pain on active motion, pain on passive motion, joint tenderness, joint swelling, joint crepitus, walking time, and observer global assessment. Self‐report ADL questionnaires included scales to assess difficulty, dissatisfaction, and pain in eight activities of daily living, as well as a visual analog pain scale and patient global assessment. Significant correlations were seen between the observerreported physical measures and self‐report questionnaire measures, indicating that both types of measures detect similar information. In comparisons made four weeks apart, changes in observer‐reported physical measures and self‐report questionnaire measures were also significantly correlated. Among the eight individual activities within the ADL scales, poorest status was reported for walking, and minimal problems were reported for the two activities involving use of the upper extremities, indicating criterion validity. Self‐report ADL questionnaire measures appeared as sensitive as traditional observer‐reported measures in detecting changes in clinical status over a four‐week period. Self‐reported ADL questionnaires appear valid, sensitive, and useful in assessment of clinical status in OA. Copyright © 1988 American College of Rheumatology

PY  - 2000
AB  - The aim of this study was to validate the results of treatment of articular fractures using a Dynastab-K (knee) external fixator, which gives a good stabilisation, while retaining motion in the knee joint. A group of 6 patients with articular fractures of the knee joint was evaluated. Two fractures were located within the distal femur and 4 within the tibial plateau. After anatomical reposition of the bone fragments primary stabilisation was achieved by means of the Dynastab-K fixator and maintained for a period of 8-10 weeks. Passive motion of the knee was implemented in the first post-op day and active motion was implemented in the third post-op day. In all cases proper healing of the fractures, full extension and a minimally limited flexion (100 degrees) were achieved. Flexion limitation was corrected by means of an intensive rehabilitation programme. Use of the presented technique allows proper stabilisation of the bone fragments with maintenance of joint motion throughout treatment. Basing on our observations we concluded that implementation of an articulated external fixator in articular fractures of the knee leads to proper fracture healing with minimal loss of motion, which can be resolved by rehabilitation procedures.

TI  - Use of virtual reality for balance training in unsteady community-dwelling elderly fallers
PY  - 2010
AB  - Introduction: Unsteadiness is considered an important risk factor for falls in elderly subjects. Despite its high prevalence, the therapeutic options for unsteadiness in elderly subjects are limited. Objective: To evaluate the effect of balance training using a virtual realty system reproducing environmental stimulation in unsteady community-dwelling elderly fallers. Methods: Twenty-two community-dwelling unsteady elderly subjects (mean age = 82 years) were treated for 6 weeks (2 sessions a week/30 minutes per session) at our Falls and Fractures Clinic using a balance rehabilitation unit, which is based on a virtual-reality system that changes sensory information/input (visual, vestibular, and somatosensory) to the patient.We assessed postural responses by posturography before and after 6 weeks in the vestibular rehabilitation program under two conditions: (1) standing, eyes open, static visual field and (2) standing, eyes open, dynamic visual field through virtualreality goggles, generating horizontal optokinetic stimulation (70 degrees per second angular velocity).We recorded postural responses with a platform measuring the confidential ellipse of the center-ofpressure distribution area and sway velocity. Changes in gait parameters were assessed using a GaitRITE walkway system. Results: After 6 weeks of treatment, postural response, confidential ellipse and sway velocity values were significantly lower (~ - 30%, p<0.05) whereas limits of stability were significantly higher (~ 37%, p<0.01) as compared with the initial assessment.These changes indicate a significant improvement in balance parameters.Additionally, gait velocity was significantly improved (50%, p<0.05) after 6 weeks of balance re-training using our virtual reality system. Conclusion:Our data demonstrates the positive effect of a virtual realty system on markers of unsteadiness in elderly fallers. This study supports the possibility of treating elderly fallers with balance disorders using virtual-reality environmental stimulation. The effect of this intervention on falls prevention and the lasting effect in the long term are subjects of future studies.

TI  - Use of virtual reality for spatial knowledge transfer: Effects of passive/active exploration mode in simple and complex routes for three different recall tasks
PY  - 2008
AB  - The use of virtual reality in the area of spatial cognition raises the question of the quality of learning transfer from a virtual to a real environment. Among the challenges, one is to determine the best cognitive aids to improve the quality of transfer and the conditions in which this is best achieved. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of passive and active exploration mode on quality of transfer in three different spatial recall tasks when the route was simple or complex. Ninety subjects (45 men and 45 women) participated in the experiment. Spatial learning was evaluated by 3 tasks: Wayfinding (route reproduction in reality), Sketch-mapping (free hand drawing) and Scene-classification (make a series of pictures in chronological order) in the context of the district of Bordeaux. In the Wayfinding task, active learning in a Virtual Environment (VE) increased performances compared to the passive learning condition, irrespective of the route complexity factor. In the Sketch-mapping task, active learning in a VE induced better performances than the passive condition, but only for complex routes. In the Picture classification task, no benefit was observed from active learning with both simple and complex routes. These results are discussed in terms of the functional demands of the three tasks and the route complexity dimension. Copyright 2008 ACM.

TI  - Use-dependent up- and down-regulation of sensorimotor brain circuits in stroke patients
PY  - 2007
AB  - Objective. To examine whether cerebral activity during passive movements decreases with time after stroke, and if reduced activity in the representation for the upper extremity can be reversed with training. Methods. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during passive wrist flexion-extension in 7 patients at varying time points after stroke, in a cross-sectional design. Upper limb function was also measured in all patients. Five of the patients took part in a training program and were measured again, behaviorally and with fMRI posttraining. Healthy control individuals of comparable age were also studied. Results. In patients, reduced activity over time after stroke was found for the group in the supplementary motor area (SMA), contralateral primary motor cortex, and prefrontal and parietal association areas along with ipsilateral cerebellum. Activity in most of these areas was also reduced in the patient group as compared to the control group. After a half-hour of daily training for 4 weeks with repetitive passive and active arm movements, cerebral activation increased in the pre-SMA and SMA, ipsilateral primary sensory cortex and intraparietal sulcus, and contralateral cerebellum in parallel with functional improvements of the upper limb. Areas common to both analyses included the SMA, pre-SMA, primary sensory cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and cerebellum. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that a down-regulation of sensorimotor activity occurs progressively over time as a result of inactivity and that training may reverse the reduced brain activity.

AB  - This paper reports on recent developments in the characterization of a novel biometric concept for the identification of users at 2.45 GHz. A wearable sensor system, worn on the arm of the user, analyses antenna-tissue coupling characteristics to differentiate between users for both static and dynamic movements. A study of the human body effects on antenna characteristics show that although the antenna-tissue coupling can vary with body movement and time, the user can be identified. Machine learning algorithmic techniques successfully identify individual humans with a classification accuracy of over 99 %. The physical layer identification concept could be used as a new biometric in future secure user authentication applications. © Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.

TI  - User interaction torque monitoring of a 7-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton with IMU-based motion input
PY  - 2017
AB  - Assistive robots, such as upper-limb exoskeletons, require sophisticated online trajectory planning to ensure user safety during operation. In order to recognize the user intention, system integrated sensors are necessary to measure the interaction with the robotic device. In this work, the concept of a remotely controlled exoskeleton using an inertia measurement unit (IMU) motion capturing system is introduced, where the interaction between the human arm and the exoskeleton is measured with structurally integrated torque sensors. The motion capture system consists of four IMUs, placed on the torso, upper-and lower arm, and the hand of the operator, who performs the arm motion for the exoskeleton worn by the user. The upper-limb exoskeleton consist of a seven actuated joints, where each joint axis is collinear to their respective joint axis of the human arm. First, the joint angles of the motion capture system and exoskeleton are calibrated. The coordinate system alignment of the IMUs is based on a gravity-vector and omega calibration. For the exoskeleton, mechanical stops at the maximal joint angles define the zero positions. Once both systems are synchronized, the operator is able to remotely control the joint angles of the exoskeleton. The motion capture system detects movements of the arm with 100 Hz sample rate and a RMSE smaller than two degrees for static positioning and five degrees for dynamic movements to determine joint angles of the human arm during activities of daily living. The user interaction torque is derived from the measured torque and the dynamic properties of the exoskeleton. The overall goal of this work is to assist joint motion and monitor joint torques of a patient during continuous passive motion therapy, where a therapist teaches online movements with the IMU motion capture system.

TI  - Using EEG (SS-EPs) to characterize the brain activity in response to textured stimuli in passive touch
PY  - 2015
AB  - When sliding our fingertip on a surface, complex vibrations are produced in the skin. In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record steady-state evoked brain potentials (SS-EPs) and characterize the cortical activity related to the passive tactile exploration of textured surfaces. In a first experiment, the right index fingertip was passively scanned against square-wave gratings having a spatial period (SP) ranging between 0.4 and 1.6 mm, using a constant normal force (1.5N) and two constant exploration velocities (17.6 mm/s, 48 mm/s). The movement of the grating was achieved using a robot with a feedback force sensor. Depending on the SP, we expected that these dynamic stimuli would elicit SS-EPs at frequencies ranging between 11 and 120 Hz and, possibly, their harmonics. We found that consistent SS-EPs can be recorded at the lowest frequency (11 Hz). In a second experiment, the fingertip was scanned against a 3.52 mm sinusoidal grating onto which a textured fabric was glued. We found that periodically modulating the magnitude of texture-induced high-frequency vibrations can elicit a measurable SSEP in the recorded EEG. Our results suggest that SS-EPs could be used to isolate and study the brain responses related to the tactile exploration of textures.

TI  - Using Passive Acoustic Recording and Automated Call Identification to Survey Koalas in the Southern Forests of New South Wales
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cost-effective surveys of low density koala populations are challenging, but technological developments in the acoustics field offer great potential for landscape-scale surveys and monitoring. We assessed passive acoustic recording coupled with automated call identification as a survey method for koalas Phascolarctos cinereus. Surveys targeted areas of previously known koala activity based on scat surveys in southern forests of New South Wales where a low density of koalas is suspected. We set 24 Song Meters to record at night over a two week period (~3,696 hours) in the koala breeding season (October/November) in Murrah Flora Reserve. Recordings were scanned by a koala call recogniser and “matches” were manually verified. Across the 24 sites, 522 validated koala bellows were recorded at 21 sites (87.5 % detection rate). Three environmental variables had most influence on detection probability of koalas, including nightly rainfall (-ve), nightly temperature (-ve) and topographic position (lower on ridges). Calling activity peaked at midnight. Sustained site occupancy, at least in the short-term, was apparent as under optimal conditions (no rain) koalas were recorded, on average, for > 50 % of survey nights rather than for just a few nights. We suggest that only a modest survey effort (4–5 nights) in the breeding season, on nights with < 3 mm of rain, is required to achieve 90–95 % probability of koala call detection in an area of low koala density. Comparison with scat surveys at the same sites revealed that detection rates were more than three times greater with acoustic surveys. Technological advances will continue to provide improvements for wildlife survey, and perhaps most importantly, for collecting much needed long-term data to assess trends in occupancy or other population attributes over time.

TI  - Using a mobile health application to monitor clinical symptoms and signs of relapse in early psychosis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: The early stages of psychotic illness are a critical period for intervention. Mobile health applications offer ecologically valid, data-rich methods of monitoring patients' daily symptoms and functioning, which could alert clinicians to early signs of relapse and facilitate early intervention. We tested a smartphone application that gathers active survey and passive movement/communication data in an outpatient early psychosis (EP) program. Methods: Early psychosis participants (N=45), ages 14-30, were enrolled from the UC Davis Early Psychosis Programs. Mobile data includes: daily surveys assessing mood, medication adherence, and social contact; weekly surveys assessing basic symptoms; and passive data (number of calls/texts, distance travelled). Repeated models analysis examined longitudinal relationships between mobile data and monthly gold-standard assessments of symptoms (BPRS) and psychosocial functioning (GFR/GFS). Results: Eighty-six percent of recruited participants were retained in the study over a minimum of 3 months with 76% survey completion. Preliminary data (N=39) indicates associations between weekly surveys and BPRS symptoms (all Ps<0.05): Higher self-reported positive and negative symptoms related to higher BPRS positive and negative symptom scores, and higher self-reported depression and anxiety related to higher BPRS depression/anxiety scores. Additionally, increased self-reported depression, anxiety, visual illusions, impaired tolerance to stress, as well as fewer hours of sleep per night predicted increased BPRS positive symptoms scores one week later. Conclusion: Results indicate 1) collecting patient-generated data via smartphone device is feasible, 2) patient-generated data closely reflect clinicianrated gold-standard assessments, and 3) weekly assessment of symptoms known to be predictive of relapse may improve early identification of relapse and facilitate early intervention in EP.

TI  - Using a novel mobile health application to monitor symptoms and functioning in an early psychosis program: Preliminary data on feasibility and acceptability
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Mobile health applications offer data-rich and ecologically valid methods of modeling patients' daily symptoms and functioning, which could inform treatment delivery and facilitate early intervention. We tested the feasibility of Ginger.io, a smartphone application that gathers active survey and passive movement/communication data, in an established early psychosis (EP) outpatient clinic. Methods: EP individuals were recruited from the UC Davis Early Detection and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) clinic. Mobile data includes: daily surveys assessing mood, medication adherence, and social contact; weekly surveys assessing basic symptoms; and daily passive data (number of calls/texts, distance travelled). Mobile data were compared to monthly gold-standard assessments of symptoms (BPRS), medication adherence (MARS), insight and psychosocial functioning. Results: Preliminary data (N=8; 86% survey completion; mean days=15, range=8-27) show associations between survey data and gold-standard measures: higher self-reported medication adherence relates to higher MARS scores (p=0.013) and greater insight (p=0.017); higher self-reported depression relates to lower clinician-assessed social functioning (p=0.05). Participants reported faceto- face social contact 85% of days, 11% included interpersonal conflicts. Greater social enjoyment relates to better daily mood (p=0.003); conversely, greater distress following interpersonal conflicts shows a trend association with worse daily mood (p=0.07). Enrollment is ongoing. Additional relationships between mobile data and gold-standard measures will be examined. Conclusions: High survey completion and emerging associations between active survey data and gold-standard assessments support feasibility of implementing mobile health applications in EP. Data collected via smartphone devices could increase understanding of early signs associated with poor clinical and functional outcomes in EP and inform treatment.

TI  - Using a piezo-resistive tactile sensor for detection of incipient slippage
PY  - 2010
AB  - The detection of incipient slip is an important cornerstone in tactile based grasping. In this paper, we present an approach to detect incipient slip using a fast piezo-resistive, yet static tactile sensor pad. Our approach renders special slip sensors obsolete and therefore enables static and dynamic sensing with one sensing mechanism. For the detection of the slip, a fast fourier transform is used to pre-process the data. In a subsequent step, a standard artificial neural net is trained on the data from the frequency domain to detect slippage, as well as to discriminate different surface textures.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Mortar samples were saturated with NaCl solutions of various concentrations and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Passive and active acoustic emission (AE) testing was conducted. The freezing temperature of the NaCl solutions in mortar corresponded with the sudden observation of passive AE events. The acoustic energy and damage parameter were calculated to evaluate the extent of freeze-thaw damage. The influence of the NaCl solution concentration and whether the solution freezes on freeze-thaw damage are discussed. © 2014 4th International Conference on the Durability of Concrete Structures.

TI  - Using curvature information in haptic shape perception of 3D objects
PY  - 2008
AB  - Are humans able to perceive the circularity of a cylinder that is grasped by the hand? This study presents the findings of an experiment in which cylinders with a circular cross-section had to be distinguished from cylinders with an elliptical cross-section. For comparison, the ability to distinguish a square cuboid from a rectangular cuboid was also investigated. Both elliptical and rectangular shapes can be characterized by the aspect ratio, but elliptical shapes also contain curvature information. We found that an elliptical shape with an aspect ratio of only 1.03 could be distinguished from a circular shape both in static and dynamic touch. However, for a rectangular shape, the aspect ratio needed to be about 1.11 for dynamic touch and 1.15 for static touch in order to be discernible from a square shape. We conclude that curvature information can be employed in a reliable and efficient manner in the perception of 3D shapes by touch.

TI  - Using ecoacoustic methods to survey the impacts of climate change on biodiversity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Climate change is an important cause of the irreversible transformation of habitats, of the rapid extinction of species, and of the dramatic changes in entire communities, especially for tropical assemblages and for habitat and range-restricted species, such as mountaintop and polar species.In particular, climate change effects several aspects of animal sounds (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, song post, and sound phenology). Animal sounds, which are life traits characterized by high plasticity, are able to cope with even modest variations of environmental fundamentals like vegetation cover, land mosaic structure, temperature, humidity, and pH (for aquatic medium). Moreover, the climatic effects on these biophonies can be observed earlier than change in vegetation patterns and visible landscape structures.Ecoacoustics, the discipline that investigates the role of sound on animal ecology from species to landscapes, offers robust models, such as acoustic adaptation, acoustic niche, acoustic active space, acoustic community, and acoustic phenology to investigate the effect of climate change on species, populations, communities, and landscapes.From an operational perspective, ecoacoustics procedures can be applied in different contexts, such as locations, weather, species, populations, behavior, physiology, and phenology. In addition, thematic priorities can be selected, such as latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, restricted habitats, stopover areas, extreme environments, weather conditions, short distance migrants, species at high vocal plasticity, sink-source status, active space, social attraction, physiological modifications, dawn and dusk choruses, sound from stressed plants, and time series analysis.The noninvasiveness of passive acoustic recording, the simultaneous collection of important data, such as community richness and diversity, immigration and extinction events, and singing dynamics as well as the availability of innovative noninvasive technologies operating over a long-term period, establish ecoacoustics as a new and important tool with which it is possible to analyze massive acoustic data sets and quickly predict and/or evaluate the effects of climate change on the environment. Moreover, passive recording is supported by cheap, user-friendly field sensors and robust data processing and may be part of the citizen science research agenda on climate change.

TI  - Using ketamine in a pediatric patient with a pain crisis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A case report
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Introduction: Ketamine has been used as a pain management strategy, particularly in adults. There are some clinical data about the use of Ketamine in children but there are no reports referring to its efficacy, specifically in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Ketamine could therefore become an alternate option in the management of refractory cases. Clinical findings: This report discusses the case of a 7-year-old male patient with a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis who was admitted to the hospital as a result of an inflammatory pain crisis associated with stiff hands and feet, pain, edema, and enthesitis, in addition to signs of bilateral sacroiliitis, stiffness impairing gait, passive and active movements, poor response to multimodal analgesia with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroids and weak opioids. Adequate pain control and significant improvement of the child’s function was achieved after initiating ketamine infusion at analgesic doses. Conclusions: This case provides valuable information about the usefulness of ketamine as a modulator of central sensitization and inflammation that could be extrapolated to a similar population of rheumatology patients.

TI  - Using ketamine to test the link between auditory evoked potential amplitude and the formation/decay of auditory sensory memory in awake behaving monkeys
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: For several seconds, auditory information about past sounds is passively stored in auditory sensory memory. Despite the importance of auditory sensory memory for many aspects of auditory function, its neural mechanisms are still a matter of debate. However, it has been noted that the amplitude of the auditory evoked N1, which is reduced immediately after a tone has been processed, recovers back to baseline at the same rate at which information decays from auditory sensory memory. Reduced N1 amplitude may thus indicate that the previous sound is still encoded in auditory sensory memory. Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show decreased performance in simple auditory tasks that have been linked to impaired encoding of information into auditory sensory memory. In addition, SZ show a blunted modulation of the N1 as a function of previous tones. This blunting can be mimicked in healthy controls by systemic injection of sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine. Here we tested the hypothesis that the administration of ketamine in the non-human primate affects both N1 amplitude and sensory memory encoding in parallel, and thus mimics the behavioral/electrophysiological phenotype in SZ. Methods: We recorded AEPs from 32 cranial EEG electrodes while macaque monkeys performed a novel delayed pitchdiscrimination task designed to track the dynamic formation and decay of auditory sensory memory. In the task, animals listened to sequences of standard tones and released a lever when they identified a pitch-deviant target tone. The stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive tones varied randomly between 0.250 and 12 sec. The target could occur between sequence positions 2 and 13. The frequencydifference between standard and target (ΔF) varied between 0 and 1.2 octaves. On catch trials (ΔF= 0) animals were rewarded for not releasing the lever. On randomly assigned days animals performed the task either after the injection of a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine or vehicle. Results: As expected, target detection rate increased with ΔF. The slope of the corresponding psychometric function was used to quantify discrimination performance as a function of SOA and the number of preceding standards. Preliminary data showed that discrimination performance gradually increased with repetition number, and decreased with SOA. Several AEPs such as the P31 and the N85 -the presumed monkey homolog of the N1- increased with SOA (while discrimination performance decreased). In contrast, AEP amplitudes generally increased with stimulus repetition number (while discrimination performance increased). Both effects shared similar timing and topography. Preliminary data from 2 recording sessions in one animal shows that the task can be performed after the injection of a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine that was previously shown to substantially blunt the scaling of AEP amplitude with SOA in a passive listening task. In clear contrast, no obvious blunting of AEP amplitude was observed when the tones were played in the context of the delayed pitch-discrimination task. However, ketamine seemed to eliminate the robust increase of N1 amplitude with repetition number that was observed on days with saline injection. The poster will provide detailed comparisons between AEP amplitude and discrimination performance on and off ketamine based on a full data set. Conclusions: Findings in the saline condition reveal a complex yet systematic relationship between the experimental manipulations (SOA and repetition number), and the two dependent variables: AEP amplitude and pitch discrimination performance. A small set of preliminary recordings suggest that AEP amplitudes are much less affected by ketamine during active pitch discrimination than during passive listening. This preliminary finding raises the interesting question of how attention and/or task engagement counteracts the strong effect of ketamine on AEP amplitude observed during passive listening. Furthermore, the preliminary observation that ketamine abolished the increase of AEP amplitude with repetition number may be related to the role of NMDA receptors in strengthening the memory trace of the standard tone across successive yet temporally isolated presentations. To validate this preliminary interpretation of the AEP data, additional recordings and analyses will need to establish a parallel effect on discrimination performance.

TI  - Using limb movements to improve spatial neglect: The role of functional electrical stimulation
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: Spatial neglect is common after right-hemisphere stroke and has proven resilient to a number of therapeutic interventions. Both active and experimenter-induced passive movements of the left limb in left hemispace have been shown to ameliorate neglect in subsets of patients by improving performance on tasks requiring attention to the left side of space. However, the high incidence of contralesional herniparesis and poor motor recovery in neglect makes active limb movement therapies applicable to only a small subset of patients. The purpose of our studies was to investigate the effects of passive movements of the left hand by functional electrical stimulation (FES), a common and portable motor rehabilitation technique, on performance in a visual scanning task.Methods: The effect of FES-induced passive movement on target detection in a visual scanning task was compared to no movement and active movement conditions and also investigated in scanning tasks in both near and far space.Results: Passive limb movement effects in neglect were variable across and within studies, reference spaces, and individuals, with a subset of positive responders differing from non-responders in regard to constructional deficits and lesion location.Conclusions: The potential viability of FES as a therapy for neglect deserves further investigation and directions for future research in this area are discussed.

Armed with these basics, they can then further investigate underlying principals as well as explore similar hypotheses. The electrical engineering graduate modules presented in this paper provide a dynamic visual representation of a complex topic: signal filtering. The purpose of these graduate modules is not only to develop a presentation aid to familiarize students with the overall concept in a dynamic medium, but also to serve as an interactive study aid for visual and physical learners, who might otherwise be lost in the static mathematical representation. This paper will present an overview of these modules and discuss the results obtained from their implementation.

TI  - Using opioid-induced bilateral vestibular dysfunction to validate the Head Impulse Testing Device-Functional Test (HITD-FT)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Introduction: Patients with bilateral vestibular dysfunction cannot fully compensate passive head rotations with eye movements, and therefore experience oscillopsia, making everyday activities, such as walking or driving harder to undertake. Their dynamic vision during passive head movements depends on their residual vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function and on re-fixation saccades. The Head Impulse Testing Device - Functional Test (HITD-FT) is a recently proposed and innovative technique for assessing dynamic vision during passive high-acceleration head rotations, mimicking natural everyday movements. Goals: To validate the HITD-FT as a tool to assess the performance of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and the effect of re-fixation saccades on the overall dynamic visual function in opioid-induced bilateral vestibular dysfunction. Materials and methods: The opioid remifentanil was continuously administrated in 14 healthy men (median age 26 years, range 21- 31) in order to reversibly induce a bilateral vestibular impairment. Each subject was tested with the HITD-FT before and during opioid administration. In each test, passive, unpredictable, high-acceleration (2000-7000degree/s2) and small amplitude (10-20degree) the ects-FT score mirrorice comched 300degree/srdmic visual function matters. Unctionality, i.e. disturbing oscillopsia lity to com head rotations where applied while subjects fixated a visual stimulus. The visual stimulus consisted of a standard Landolt ring and appeared on a screen 80 +/- 2 ms after head acceleration reached 300degree/s2. Subjects were asked to identify the orientation of the ring and the provided answers were analyzed together with eye and head movements recorded with EyeSeeCam system. Results: Before opioid application, VOR and dynamic reading performances were intact (head-impulse gain: 0.87 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD; HITD-FT rate of correct answers: 90 +/- 9%). The opioid administration induced impairment in the VOR function (head-impulse gain 0.63 +/- 0.19) and in dynamic reading (HITD-FT 26 +/- 15%) in 12/14 subjects. HITD-FT scores correlated with head-impulse gain impairment (R = 0.63, p = 0.03) and with gain difference (before/during opioid R = -0.64, p = 0.02). One subject had non-pathological head-impulse gain (0.82 +/- 0.03) and high HITD-FT score (92%). One subject could read (93%) despite a low head-impulse gain (0.59 +/- 0.03) performing re-fixation saccades. Summary: Our study suggests that the recently proposed HITD-FT is an appropriate method to document the combined effect of VOR performance and re-fixation saccades in vestibular dysfunction. Testing dynamic vision with head movement characteristics closely related to subjects' daily activities makes the HITD-FT a suitable tool for assessing overall dynamic visual performance, e.g., to monitor progress during vestibular rehabilitation.

TI  - Using particle swarm optimization to solve asynchronous measurements bearings-only target tracking
PY  - 2014
AB  - In human object tracking technology by using pyroelectric infrared sensor (PIR), PIR is used to be in static condition to realize localization through creating overlapping detection regions. In this paper, we developed a wireless pyroelectric sensor network (WPSN) in which the PIR is dynamic. It can measure the direction of a thermal target moving through monitoring area and produce a detecting-angle sequence. To this asynchronous measurements bearing-only (ABO), we analyzed the relationship between the detecting-angle sequence and the discrete points in polar coordinates of moving target trajectory, found that the target trace is determined by the polar radius sequence. So, a multi-dimensional polar diameter particle swarm optimization (PSO) space is established. Meanwhile, a fitness function to evaluate the particle's merits is proposed. In the end, the algorithm is applied. Compared with static perception localization, the proposed method is an effective solution to enlarge the detection range, reduce the number of PIR sensors, simplify the equipment. The experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the method. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.

TI  - Using passive acoustic monitoring to assess humpback whale occurrence and breeding activity around La Réunion Island
PY  - 2018
AB  - Humpback whales use the coastal waters of La Réunion Island seasonally from June to October. Their distribution is relatively well-known on the west coast, which provides suitable breeding habitat, however little is known about their use and movement along the south and east coast of the island. Three autonomous acoustic recorders were deployed during the breeding season of 2016 off the west, south and east coasts to investigate spatial and temporal variations in humpback whale occurrence around the island. The dataset consisted of 10 minute acoustic recordings every hour, continuously from mid-June to early September from these three locations. Song and social call events were discriminated and their total durations were calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total recording duration per day. Off the west and south coast, social calls were distributed fairly homogenously over the season, while songs occurred over a shorter time period, with two significant peaks observed in mid-July and early-August. Off the east coast very few vocalizations were detected. These results demonstrated that humpback whales preferentially use the west coast of the island for breeding. In this area, daily variations in singing activity were observed. Singers appeared to be more active at night and during the morning, when less boat traffic was detected.

TI  - Using passive and active acoustic methods for impact damage assessment of composite structures
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study aims to use the passive and active acoustic-based health monitoring methods for impact damage assessment of composite structures. To this aim, a Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite plate was fabricated and subjected to a simulated low-velocity impact by performing repeated quasi-static indentation tests where a loading-unloading-reloading test profile with 5 repetitions was adopted. Two Acoustic Emission (AE) broadband sensors and a network of eight piezoelectric (PZT) sensors were attached on the composite plate surface. AE (passive method) was employed during the loading and reloading phases of the indentation tests to online monitor the critical damage occurrence and also specify the damage type while scanning of the plate with Lamb waves (active method) was done to localize the damage when the structure was unloaded. Felicity Ratio (FR) index which was calculated based on the AE data could accurately detect that critical damage occurred during the 5th loading-unloading-reloading stage when the structural integrity dropped to 60% of its initial stage. Furthermore, Lamb wave signals of central frequency 150 kHz localized the impact damage with error of 0.89 cm (3.6% error respect to the shortest dimension of the scanned area). © 2019

TI  - Using recurrent artificial neural network model to estimate voluntary elbow torque in dynamic situations
PY  - 2005
AB  - Muscle modelling is an important component of body segmental motion analysis. Although many studies had focused on static conditions, the relationship between electromyographic (EMG) signals and joint torque under voluntary dynamic situations has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) under voluntary dynamic situations for torque estimation of the elbow complex. EMG signals together with kinematic data, which included angle and angular velocity, were used as the inputs to estimate the expected torque during movement. Moreover, the roles of angle and angular velocity in the accuracy of prediction were investigated, and two models were compared. One model used EMG and joint kinematic inputs and the other model used only EMG inputs without kinematic data. Six healthy subjects were recruited, and two average angular velocities (60 degrees s(-1) and 90 degrees s(-1)) with three different loads (0 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg) in the hand position were selected to train and test the RANN between 90 degrees elbow flexion and full elbow extension (0 degrees). After training, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with EMG and joint kinematic inputs in the training data set and the test data set, were 0. 17 +/- 0.03 Nm and 0.35 +/- 0.06 Nm, respectively. The RMSE values between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with only EMG inputs in the training data set and the test set, were 0.57 +/- 0.07 Nm and 0. 73 +/- 0. 11 Nm, respectively. The results showed that EMG signals together with kinematic data gave significantly better performance in the joint torque prediction; joint angle and angular velocity provided important information in the estimation of joint torque in voluntary dynamic movement.

TI  - Using scientific visualization to enhance the teaching and learning of core concepts
PY  - 2015
AB  - Scientific visualization is a particular type of information representation that involves the use of static and dynamic visual and graphical media. To develop fluency with scientific visualization, one needs to develop the ability to interpret, analyze, and construct meaning from appropriate visual representations. Results from the cognitive sciences and discipline-based education research indicate that visual images help us learn and reason. We present vignettes from a variety of higher education perspectives in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines that illustrate the use of scientific visualizations in different settings. In particular, the cases illustrate how faculty recognized that a lack of media literacy was impairing student success and then responded by embedding the teaching of those skills into course content. In this chapter, we move from basic interpretation of x−y line graphs in mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses to learning biology from animated simulations and student-generated digital videos to explain neuroscience concepts. Practitioners reading this chapter will gain instructional insight into the challenges students encounter when learning and strategies that faculty can employ to overcome those challenges.

TI  - Using stable isotopes to discern mechanisms of connectivity in estuarine detritus-based food webs
PY  - 2015
AB  - In this paper, we focus on 2 mechanisms of cross-boundary food web connectivity in Puget Sound estuaries: passive transport of water-advected organic matter (OM) and active movement of organisms. Both mechanisms serve as potential vectors of food web connectivity, but little research has investigated whether landscape setting changes the dominance of one mechanism over another, or whether the influence of organism movement on food web connectivity can be detected in estuarine systems. We use fish diets, stable isotopes and Bayesian mixing models to identify differences in OM sources assimilated by estuarine fishes, testing whether increased organism mobility or increased fluvial influence results in greater food web connectivity. We compare food web connectivity in 2 different estuaries, one displaying limited freshwater inputs, and the other the terminus of a major river system. Within each estuary, we investigate whether differences in behavioral life history traits correspond to differences in the diets, isotopic signatures and OM assimilation of 2 fish species: bay pipefish Syngnathus leptorhynchus, which displays site fidelity to eelgrass beds, and the more transitory juvenile English sole Parophrys vetulus, which moves throughout estuarine deltas during the early demersal growth stage. Our results show water advection plays a dominant role in large-scale OM transport and delivery to adjoining ecosystems in the fluvial estuary, while organism movement provides the more important mechanism of food web connectivity in the estuary exhibiting minor fluvial discharge. However, the 2 mechanisms certainly interact to enhance food web connectivity across estuarine ecotones.

TI  - Using the Job Demands - Resources Model to Understand Student Engagement: The Impact of Resource Use on Academic Outcomes, and the Impact of Need for Cognition on Engagement
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Job Demands-Resources Model shows that job characteristics, namely resources and demands, lead to job engagement and job burnout (e.g., Salanova & Bakker, 2004).  Engagement and burnout, described as psychological states, mediate the relationships between resources, demands, and job outcomes.  Specifically, engagement results from job resources, and leads to outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, and enhanced performance, and burnout results from demands, and leads to outcomes such as turnover, absence, impaired performance, and stress-related health consequences.       A limitation in the Job Demands-Resources Model literature is that studies of this model have focused on perceptions of the same set of job characteristics to measure resources.  Therefore, we do not know if resources outside of perceptions of autonomy, feedback, social support, relationship with supervisor, training, and developmental opportunities might fulfill the predictions of the model.  In addition, studies do not measure the degree to which participants actually use these resources, so we do not know whether active resource use has more of an impact on work outcomes than passive perception of resources.       Another limitation of the Job Demands-Resources Model is that it does not propose a relationship between demands and engagement, although some studies suggest that such a relationship may exist.  Specifically, individual differences may interact with demands to impact engagement.       The current study attempted to address these gaps in the literature, using a student sample.  A model was proposed that replicated some of the well-supported findings of the Job Demands-Resources Model.  In addition, two new variables were added into the model. First, resource use, theoretically framed as behavioral engagement, was added as a consequence of state engagement, an idea that was proposed by Macey and Schneider, (2008).  In addition, a moderator variable was introduced, the need for cognition, which was proposed to uncover a relationship between demands and state engagement. Need for cognition was chosen because of its relationship to academic motivation and performance, and thus its relevance to the student sample. Structural equation modeling and moderated structural equation modeling techniques were used to test the study hypotheses.  The study hypotheses were partially supported.  Implications of this study are discussed.

TI  - Using virtual reality and upper limb unloading to correct motion synergy in poststroke patients
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Poststroke upper limb paresis, spasticity and caused by them pathological synergies is the main problem on the way to daily living activities recovery. Motor training in virtual reality (VR) creates the necessary training space for motor skills relearning. Objective: Aim of the study: to study the possibility of correcting pathological post-stroke upper limb synergies by applying combined VR and weight support training. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: 25 chronic poststroke patients were enrolled in this study. Main group (n=15) were trained using upper limb exoskeleton system with arm weight unloading and VR imitation of daily living activities such as reaching and grasping. Control group (n=10) was trained using arm weight support and task oriented training without VR. Results: Were found: arm, wrist and hand active movements, passive range of movements (ROM), total arm functionality and movements out of synergy improvements (p<0,05) in the Fugl-Meyer scale (FM). Also were found ARAT improvement of cylindrical and pinch grip (p<0,05). Motion analysis showed simultaneous active shoulder adduction decreasing and shoulder flexion increasing (p<0,05) in 53% of patients, and simultaneous increasing of shoulder flexion with elbow extension (p<0,05) in 60% of patients. In control group only passive ROM (FM) increased and no significant changed were found in motion analysis and ARAT scale. Conclusion: Combined VR and weight support training can be more effective to restore the impaired motor function after stroke than conventional weight support training. This approach contributes to the motor pattern reorganization through biomechanical and visual feedback, projected into the virtual space.

TI  - Using virtual reality to augment perception, enhance sensorimotor adaptation, and change our minds.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Technological advances that involve human sensorimotor processes can have both intended and unintended effects on the central nervous system (CNS). This mini review focuses on the use of virtual environments (VE) to augment brain functions by enhancing perception, eliciting automatic motor behavior, and inducing sensorimotor adaptation. VE technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in medical rehabilitation, training simulators, gaming, and entertainment. Although these VE applications have often been shown to optimize outcomes, whether it be to speed recovery, reduce training time, or enhance immersion and enjoyment, there are inherent drawbacks to environments that can potentially change sensorimotor calibration. Across numerous VE studies over the years, we have investigated the effects of combining visual and physical motion on perception, motor control, and adaptation. Recent results from our research involving exposure to dynamic passive motion within a visually-depicted VE reveal that short-term exposure to augmented sensorimotor discordance can result in systematic aftereffects that last beyond the exposure period. Whether these adaptations are advantageous or not, remains to be seen. Benefits as well as risks of using VE-driven sensorimotor stimulation to enhance brain processes will be discussed.

TI  - Using virtual reality to characterize episodic memory profiles in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Influence of active and passive encoding
PY  - 2012
AB  - Most neuropsychological assessments of episodic memory bear little similarity to the events that patients actually experience as memories in daily life. The first aim of this study was to use a virtual environment to characterize episodic memory profiles in an ecological fashion, which includes memory for central and perceptual details, spatiotemporal contextual elements, and binding. This study included subjects from three different populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second, we sought to determine whether environmental factors that can affect encoding (active vs. passive exploration) influence memory performance in pathological aging. Third, we benchmarked the results of our virtual reality episodic memory test against a classical memory test and a subjective daily memory complaint scale. Here, the participants were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration). Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts. Following each immersion, we assessed the patient's recall and recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of binding. We found that the AD patients' performances were inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory assessments were found to be particularly useful for distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patients' daily memory complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on the virtual test than with their performances on the classical memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific cognitive differences found between these three populations that may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular, neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to moderate AD is discussed in the context of relatively preserved frontal and motor brain functions implicated in self-referential effects and procedural abilities.

AB  - This study attempted to compare the behavioral effects of active, rhythm­based group music therapy vs. those of passive, listening­based group music therapy on preadolescents with emotional, learning, and behavioral disorders. It was hypothesized that preadolescents who participated in active music therapy would more significantly improve target behaviors than those involved in passive music therapy. Achenbach's Teacher Report Form (TRF) was used to confirm changes among subjects in attention, motivation, and hostility as rated by homeroom teachers. Twelve music therapy sessions were conducted over a 4­month period with three different groups of subjects (n = 16), with two groups participating in active music therapy and the other receiving passive music therapy. Results indicate that subjects improved significantly after receiving both music therapy interventions. The most significant change in subjects was found on the aggression/hostility scale. These results suggest that group music therapy can facilitate the process of self­expression in emotionally disturbed/learning disabled adolescents and provide a channel for transforming frustration, anger, and aggression into the experience of creativity and self­mastery. Discussion of results also includes recommendations for choosing one music therapy approach over another based on personality types and/or clinical diagnoses of subjects. In general, music therapy techniques can be classified into active, "music­making" and passive, "music listening" approaches. Although both therapeutic styles have been found to be effective in treating emotionally disturbed/learning disabled preadolescents, little empirical research has been conducted to determine which approach would enable optimum outcomes for this particular client population. In addition, few studies have attempted to compare both music therapy approaches to evaluate the differences in their effectiveness in dealing with specific problematic behaviors. In recent music therapy literature, empirical studies have been limited to assessing the outcomes of specifically active or passive approaches (Haines, 1989; Wasserman, 1972). For instance, active music therapy has been found to improve self­esteem, peer relationships, and group cohesiveness. Michel and Martin (1970) reported that successful experiences through ukelele lessons were found to improve self­ esteem of boys with learning and behavior problems. Cassity (1976) found that group guitar lessons contributed to peer acceptance and group cohesiveness of adult psychiatric patients. Johnson (1981) reported that music­related activities such as song writing and rhythmic improvisation, with objective and concrete evidence of goal achievement, improved self­concept among juvenile delinquents. In an individual case, Kivland (1986) used private piano lessons to increase the self­esteem and peer­acceptance of a hospitalized adolescent diagnosed with conduct disorder. Emotionally handicapped middle school students learned appropriate interpersonal skills through active music therapy techniques and transferred these acquired social skills to their classrooms (Eidson, 1989). Haines (1989) found increases in cooperation and communication which developed from playing drums during music therapy sessions versus verbal group therapy treatments. Passive music experiences have also been found to enhance self­esteem and group cohesion. Henderson (1983) reported that listening exercises focusing on mood recognition and awareness in music enhanced self­esteem and group cohesion among hospitalized adolescents with adjustment disorders. Behavioral music therapists have successfully implemented music­listening as a behavioral reinforcer to extinguish maladaptive behaviors (Hauck & Martin, 1970; Underhill & Harris, 1974; Williams & Dorow, 1983). Other studies have focused on the direct physical effects of listening to music. Cripe (1986) found that rock music significantly reduced hyperactivity in boys with attention deficit disorder. Morton, Kershner, and Siegel (1990) discovered that prior exposure to music increased memory capacity and reduced distractibility of right­handed normal boys. Thus far, research comparing the effects of different techniques of music therapy has been too limited to generalize outcomes to diverse clinical populations. In one related study conducted by Thaut (1989), it was found that three different treatment approaches, that is, (a) passive, listening music therapy; (b) active, instrumental improvisation; and (c) passive, listening and relaxation, were all successful in improving self­ perceived behavioral change, such as relaxation, mood/emotion, and thought/insight of psychiatric prisoner­patients, although differences in the magnitude of change was observed. Thaut's study may be an important positive step in proposing the necessity and usefulness of comparative study. However, it is unknown which type of music therapy approach would bring optimum outcomes for the targeted population, and how different music therapy approaches could affect observable behavior. Based on the following conceptual framework, it was speculated that music­making, particularly rhythm­based music, could more effectively meet the needs of emotionally disturbed and learning disabled preadolescents than a passive music­listening approach. Concept 1. In individuals with learning disabilities (most commonly characterized by attentional deficits, perceptual disorders, and language deficits) a certain amount of internal arrhythmia or dysrhythmia is apparent (Evans, 1986). The lack of a consistent internal rhythm due to early trauma, parental neglect, and/or nervous disorders could be an underlying cause of attentional and motivational problems in learning disabled preadolescents. It is hypothesized that maintaining a steady beat can be helpful in allowing individuals to experience internal structure and security. According to Bonny (1986), rhythm, as the organizing and energizing force of music (Gaston, 1968), can help to synchronize physiological functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing so that an individual is in harmony with his or herself. Merely keeping a steady beat is believed to help clients to control impulses, bring order, and promote feelings of safety and stability (Bruscia, 1987). Rhythm is also instrumental in the process of coordinating mind (cognitive modality) and body (psychomotor modality), which is often difficult for traumatized individuals (Montello, 1996). Concept 2. Prior research indicates that rhythm training can foster reading ability in educable mentally retarded children (Ross, Ross, & Kuchenbecker, 1973). According to Hanes (1986), the properties of rhythm as defined in language and speech behavior and in skilled motor performance strike reasonable parallels in several accounts of reading proficiency. Rhythm training has also been found to significantly improve field­independence in normal children (Parente & O'Malley, 1975). These data suggest that a clinically­based rhythm training approach could be effective in enhancing learning in our target population which could, in turn, activate motivation and reduce hostility resulting from academic frustration. In addition to the advantages offered by rhythm­training, instrumental improvisation, which is a major component of the active music therapy approach utilized in this study, has been reported to offer a number of opportunities to meet the needs of the target population by (a) drawing the client into active involvement (Bruscia, 1987); (b) displaying skills and accomplishments (Eidson, 1989); and (c) channelling undesirable impulses or tension (e.g., aggression/hostility) into socially acceptable activities (Crocker, 1968). Using this conceptual framework, the following hypothesis was formulated: Preadolescents with emotional, learning, and behavioral disorders who participated in active (rhythm­training and improvisation) music therapy, as compared to those who were exposed to passive (listening) music therapy, would improve more significantly in the three targeted behaviors: attention, motivation, and aggression/hostility. METHOD SUBJECTS Subjects were 16 preadolescents ranging in age from 11 to 14 years old (14 males and 2 females, mean age = 11.94 years) enrolled in a special education program in a public middle school in New York City. Subjects were diagnosed with emotional disturbances, learning disabilities, and/or attention deficit disorder. The symptoms included poor emotional control, low frustration tolerance, poor academic performance,

AB  - Background. Primary reconstruction of flexor tendons lesions resulting from serious hand mutilations is not always possible. This causes problems in the rehabilitation of finger joints that are unable to perform active flexion. There is no generally accepted approach to such cases. The authors used a dynamic splinting regimen to treat fingers with unrepaired flexor tendons qualified for secondary reconstruction. Material and methods. Our research involved 39 patients treated in the Department Limb Replantation at St. Jadwiga's Hospital in Trzebnica, Poland, who had been referred for flexor tendon repair (from 1 to 3) in secondary reconstruction. The time from the primary operation ranged from 10 to 14 weeks. There were 27 men and 12 women, ranging in age from 19 to 60 years (ave. 39.5), divided into two groups. 24 patients (group I) had their fingers mobilized by dynamic splinting method, while in 14 patients (group II) no specific regimen of rehabilitation applied: the patients mobilized their fingers with their unimpaired hand. Results. The loss of total passive motion of finger joints was up to 75.65° (∼29%) greater in group II. Conclusions. The method applied is very effective in maintaining a wide range of passive motion in finger joints, which is essential for secondary flexor tendon reconstruction. © Medsportpress, 2006.

PY  - 2017
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the function of the utricle and horizontal semicircular canals in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving primary health care, with/without a history of falls. 101 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 34 to 84 years old (26 with and 75 without a history of falls) and 51 healthy volunteers (40-83 years old) accepted to participate. They denied having a history of dizziness, vertigo, unsteadiness, hearing loss, or neurological disorders. None of them were seeking care due to sensory or balance decline. After a clinical evaluation and report of symptoms related to balance using a standardised questionnaire, lateral canal function was assessed by sinusoidal rotation at 0.16 Hz and 1.28 Hz (60 degrees/sec peak velocity), otolith function was assessed by static visual vertical (average of 10 trials) and dynamic visual vertical during unilateral centrifugation (300 degrees/sec at 3.5 cm) and static posturography was performed on hard/soft surface with eyes open/closed. Compared to healthy volunteers, patients showed decreased responses to unilateral centrifugation, but similar responses to horizontal canal stimuli (independently of age, peripheral neuropathy or a history of falls) (ANCoVA p < 0.05) and a larger sway area with a lengthier sway path. Compared to patients with no falls, patients with falls had a higher female/male ratio and a higher frequency of score >= 4 on the questionnaire of symptoms related to balance, but similar age, body mass index and frequency of peripheral neuropathy. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, receiving primary healthcare who are not seeking care due to sensory or balance decline, utricular function may be impaired even in the absence of horizontal canal dysfunction or a history of falls.

AB  - The clinical effectiveness of an anti arthrotic drug was investigated in a comparative trial. 106 patients suffering from moderate arthrosis of the knee were placed into 2 groups in accordance with a random table and treated by intramuscular injection of Arteparon forte or an analogous control product. The criteria of assessment were pain on movement, pain at rest, limitation of active and of passive movement. The number of patients who at the end of treatment and at the time of followup, 3 mth later, had no or insignificant residual symptoms and signs, were greater in the Arteparon forte group than in the control group. This difference was statistically significant 2 mth after the beginning of treatment for the criterion pain at rest, and 5 mth after beginning of treatment for all criteria. A global assessment of the results was carried out according to the number of pronouncedly improved criteria in the individual patients. According to this assessment, the results of treatment at the termination of treatment amounted to 73.6% in the Arteparon forte group and 56.6% in the control group. At the time of followup the corresponding value of the Arteparon forte group was 68.4%, thus significantly greater than that of the control group (29.4%).

TI  - VIDEO SALIENCY PREDICTION WITH OPTIMIZED OPTICAL FLOW AND GRAVITY CENTER BIAS
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dynamic videos are viewed fundamentally different from static images. Besides spatial features, motion feature also plays an important role as a temporal factor. Most existing video saliency models usually employ optical flow to represent the motion feature. However, optical flow often suffers from the discontinuity problem. And we also notice that human fixations in one single video frame are much sparser than that in an identical still picture. However, many spatial saliency models take each video frame as static image independently. In this paper, we predict the dynamic visual saliency by fusing spatial and temporal features. In order to construct the temporal relationships among a set of successive frames, we introduce a smoothness operator in optical flow field to obtain more accurate motion feature. Then, considering the sparse property of video saliency, we adapt the weights of the regions surrounding to the saliency gravity center in the final maps. The experiments show that our model is more consistent with humans eye-tracking benchmarks than the state-of-the-art models.

Previous research has produced inconsistent results with respect to the links among the three sets of variables in this observational learning process. Results of a path analysis indicated strong negative relationships between static complexity and all three viewer variables, positive relationships between dynamic complexity and both attention and recognition, and between attention and both types of learning. No significant relationship emerged between dynamic complexity and recall. Implications for television production aimed at young children are discussed. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

Male basketball players and swimmers were chosen as representative of those populations. The subjects were selected from university varsity teams; a total of 154 subjects were tested. Eleven vision tests were administered to each subject. The test battery was contained in a portable, compact, vision tester: the Mark II. A stepwise discriminant analysis identified two tests that discriminated the two groups of athletes. These were static acuity under normal illumination and static acuity under glare conditions. Results were significant at the .01 level (F(,2,151) = 6.541).

TI  - VISUAL EVENT-RELATED P3A FROM PASSIVE TASK IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: The paradigm effects were not enough to be elucidated, even though it is well known that the event-related potential P300 was useful for exploring schizophrenia. Most P300 studies require the subject to actively respond to the target stimulus, but P300-like waveforms also can be elicited with 'passive' auditory paradigms in which an intentional discrimination between the two tones is not required. Methods: This study was designed to examine that visual passive paradigm is appropriate for relatively uncooperative and admitted patients with schizophrenia. Visual 3 stimulus oddball paradigm was employed for admitted patients with schizophrenia (N=50) and controls (N=35). For the patients, the symptoms severity was assessed by Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). The paradigm was composed of standard (small circle, 80%), distractors (large rectangle, 10%), and targets (large circle, 10%) in a random manner once every 2 s. The passive task was presented first, and the subjects were instructed to look at the monitor inrelaxed manner. The active task was presented in second session, and subjects were asked to press a mouse button to the targets. P3a to the distractors is elicited in passive and active tasks. P3b to the targets is elicited in active task. Results: In active paradigm, the P3a and P3b were successfully acquired in all 35 control subjects (100%), but in only 35 patients (75%). In passive paradigm, the P3a was elicited for 45 patients (90%) as well as for 35 control subjects (100%). Passive P3a (F=3.7, p=0.08 in amplitude, F=32, p<0.0001 in latency), active P3a (F=12.6, p=0.001 in amplitude, F=25, p<0.0001 in latency), and active P3b (F=2.6, p=0.09 in amplitude, F=14.3, p<0.001)) were smaller and delayed in patients with schizophrenia. With using mixed between (groups) and within (anterior-posterior and laterality) repeated measurement ANOVA, the P300 components showed topographic differences between two groups (F=4.4, p=0.03 in passive P3a, F=5.7, p=0.001 in active P3a, and F=5.4, p=0.01 in active P3b). Discussion: Such a passive paradigm could be very interested, since it can be used with non-compliant subjects such as young children, individuals with demented illness, and difficult psychiatric patients. However, conventional visual stimuli presented under passive viewing conditions can not elicit reliable P300 components because the attentional demands of a visual target in an oddball sequence are not compelling relative to the alerting qualities of an infrequent auditory target stimulus. Thus, passive and active paradigms can produce P300 waveforms because component outcomes are determined by the eliciting stimuli if only when their physical qualities coerce attentional engagement. The passive 3 stimulus visual P300 paradigm could be used for further exploring the patients with schizophrenia without or minimizing losing the information from some patients who are uncooperative with using only the conventional active P300 paradigms.

AB  - A simple technique for dynamic and static visual presentation is described. The students were shown how to recognize certain types of symmetry in a waveform such that if f(x) equals f( minus x) then the function is designated ″even″ and the Fourier analysis will give only a constant term plus a series of cosines. Alternatively if f(x) equals minus f( minus x) then a sine series only ensues.

AB  - Efforts to assess visual deterioration with increasing age, coupled with new mechanisms proposed to limit the exposure of visually impaired drivers to driving risks, have emerged in response to the increase in older drivers. Visual functions discussed in this context include static acuity (photopic, mesopic, and in the presence of glare), dynamic visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and motion perception. Exposure control mechanisms discussed include alternative periodic vision testing strategies, visual training, and environmental and vehicular modifications to accommodate the older driver. Finally, relevant research needs are addressed.

TI  - VISUALIZATION AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF STUDYING PEDAGOGY STUDENTS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract. In the article reveals the effectiveness of using the method of visualization of the content of educational material in pedagogy. The aim of this article is an analysis of methods of visualizing the content of educational information in pedagogical classes during the study of the topic “Project Learning Technologies”. During a scientific search the methods of analysis, synthesis, generalization, systematization, modeling are used. It is emphasized, that one of the effective ways of activating students' educational activity is visualization of educational material, the active use of which in the educational process allows to move away from the passive perception of the content by the future specialists to the active mastery of it; visualization provides intensification of the educational process, formation and development of students' critical and visual thinking. Visualization is defined as ways of clearly covering the content of educational material in a structured form by means of diagrams, tables, graphs, frames, etc., which will contribute to the effective acquisition of the system of competences by the acquirers of education. In the process of teaching of course "Pedagogy" students are best developed active creativity, critical thinking, when using traditional ways of visualizing the content of educational material (flowchart, graph diagram, logical circuit (sequence of processes), table, etc.) and the newest (denotation) graph, frame, intellectual and strategic maps, cluster, etc.). The ways of visualization of the content of educational material on pedagogy (denotation graph, frame, intellectual maps) in the course of studying the topic "Technology of project training" are revealed. The variants of visualization of the content of the educational material on the project technology of training with the help of a frame, a denotation graph, and intellectual maps are offered. Summed up, that visualization of the content of educational material on pedagogy allows to solve a number of pedagogical tasks, namely: to promote intensification of learning; to activate educational and cognitive activity of students; to develop critical, creative and radiant thinking; duplicate verbal information in a figurative way, establishing causality between pedagogical concepts and phenomena; to shape visual literacy and visual culture.

TI  - VISUALIZATION OF A RAPID, RED FAR-RED LIGHT-DEPENDENT REACTION BY CENTRIFUGE MICROSCOPY
PY  - 1992
AB  - Using a centrifuge microscope with stroboscopic illumination, we examined the effects of light irradiation on the passive movement of chloroplasts in dark-adapted mesophyll cells of Vallisneria gigantea. While irradiation with red light accelerates the passive gliding of chloroplasts produced by centrifugal force, irradiation with far-red light negates this effect. Irradiation with blue light does not accelerate the passive gliding, while red light is completely effective even in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, an inhibitor of photosynthesis. An apparently active movement of chloroplasts can be induced by irradiation with red or blue light only in the presence of the far-red light-absorbing form of phytochrome. The significance of the reaction in the light with respect to the regulation of cytoplasmic streaming is discussed.

TI  - VISUO-PROPRIOCEPTIVE INTERACTIONS IN DEGENERATIVE CERVICAL SPINE DISEASES REQUIRING SURGERY
PY  - 2013
AB  - Cervical proprioception plays a key role in postural control, but its specific contribution is controversial. Postural impairment was shown in whiplash injuries without demonstrating the sole involvement of the cervical spine. The consequences of degenerative cervical spine diseases are underreported in posture-related scientific literature in spite of their high prevalence. No report has focused on the two different mechanisms underlying cervicobrachial pain: herniated discs and spondylosis. This study aimed to evaluate postural control of two groups of patients with degenerative cervical spine diseases with or without optokinetic stimulation before and after surgical treatment. Seventeen patients with radiculopathy were recruited and divided into two groups according to the spondylotic or discal origin of the nerve compression. All patients and a control population of 31 healthy individuals underwent a static posturographic test with 12 recordings; the first four recordings with the head in 0 degrees position: eyes closed, eyes open without optokinetic stimulation, with clockwise and counter clockwise optokinetic stimulations. These four sensorial situations were repeated with the head rotated 30 degrees to the left and to the right. Patients repeated these 12 recordings 6 weeks postoperatively. None of the patients reported vertigo or balance disorders before or after surgery. Prior to surgery, in the eyes closed condition, the herniated disc group was more stable than the spondylosis group. After surgery, the contribution of visual input to postural control in a dynamic visual environment was reduced in both cervical spine diseases whereas in a stable visual environment visual contribution was reduced only in the spondylosis group. The relative importance of visual and proprioceptive inputs to postural control varies according to the type of pathology and surgery tends to reduce visual contribution mostly in the spondylosis group.

TI  - VOG-ENHANCED ICA FOR SSVEP RESPONSE DETECTION FROM CONSUMER-GRADE EEG
PY  - 2014
AB  - The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm detects when users look at flashing static and dynamic visual stimuli. Electroculogram (EOG) artefacts in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal limit the application for dynamic stimuli because they elicit smooth pursuit eye movement. We propose 'VOG-ICA' - an EOG artefact rejection technique based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that uses video-oculography (VOG) information from an eye tracker. It demonstrates good performance compared to Plochl when evaluated on matched and EEG data collected with consumer grade eye tracking and wireless cap EEG apparatus. SSVEP response detection from frequential features extracted from ICA components demonstrates higher SSVEP response detection accuracy and lower between-person variation compared with extracted features from raw and post-ICA reconstructed 'clean' EEG. The work highlights the requirement for robust EEG artefact and SSVEP response detection techniques for consumer-grade multimodal apparatus.

TI  - VOIES AERIENNES SUPERIEURES ET SYNDROME D'APNEES DU SOMMEIL
PY  - 1995
AB  - The imaging techniques of the upper airway (UA) now permit a description of the characteristics of pharyngeal collapse during the course of obstructive apnoea. The start is oropharyngeal with active movements anteriorally and posteriorally of the soft palate and a falling back of the tongue. The extension occurs almost systematically towards the hypopharynx. A displacement of the hyoid bone and of the cervical spine is noted synchronously with thoracoabdominal movements. These imaging techniques of UA show the occurrence of passive pharyngeal collapse during certain types of central apnoea. In snorers and in apnoeics, there is a reduction of the calibre of the pharynx. However, these abnormalities are not specific and do not enable the diagnosis to be confirmed nor an estimate of the severity of the sleep apnoea syndrome. Cephalometry and computed tomography of the pharynx should be carried out particularly when a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is envisaged. For practical purposes, the existence on cephalometry of retrognathism with an MP-H > 24 mm and a PAS distance of <5 mm is associated with a poor result for UPPP. The same thing applies when macroglossia or a reduction of the surface of the hypopharynx is found on computed tomography.

TI  - VOLUME INTERSECTION FOR SHAPE FROM SILHOUETTES
PY  - 1993
AB  - Volume intersection is one of the simplest paradigms for recovering shape from 2D images. The underlying principle in this method is reconstructing an object by intersecting the volumes obtained by back-projecting its silhouettes in their corresponding directions. The set of silhouettes could be predetermined or it could be decided dynamically for optimum reconstruction. The former approach is passive while the latter comes under the purview of active vision. In this paper, the author attempts to integrate his research results in obtaining a linear octree description of an object from its silhouettes making use of a data structure called range[i,j,0/1]. The problem of shape from silhouette is formalized and it is shown here that the conventional approach of volume intersection for this problem need not be always efficient. The advantage of active vision technique is also discussed in the present context.

TI  - VR Grabbers: Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting for Precision Grabbing Tools
PY  - 2018
AB  - Haptic feedback in VR is important for realistic simulation in virtual reality. However, recreating the haptic experience for hand tools in VR traditionally requires hardware with precise actuators, adding complexity to the system. We propose Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting, an interaction technique that provides a realistic haptic experience for grabbing tools using only passive mechanisms. This technique leverages the ungrounded feedback inherent in grabbing tools combined with dynamic visual adjustments of their position in virtual reality to create an illusion of physical presence for virtual objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of this technique, we created VR Grabbers, an exemplary passive VR controller, similar to training chopsticks, with haptic feedback for precise object selection and manipulation.We conducted two user studies based on VR Grabbers. The first study probed the perceptual limits of the illusion; we found that the maximum position difference between the virtual and physical world acceptable to the user is (1:48; 1:95) cm. The second study showed that task performance of the VR Grabbers controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting enabled outperforms the same controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting disabled.

TI  - Vagus nerve stimulation paired with tactile training improved sensory function in a chronic stroke patient
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation can enhance neural plasticity in the primary sensory and motor cortices, improve forelimb function after stroke in animal models and improve motor function in patients with arm weakness after stroke.OBJECTIVE: To gain "first-in-man" experience of VNS paired with tactile training in a patient with severe sensory impairment after stroke.METHODS: During the long-term follow-up phase of a clinical trial of VNS paired with motor rehabilitation, a 71-year-old man who had made good motor recovery had ongoing severe sensory loss in his left hand and arm. He received VNS paired with tactile therapy in an attempt to improve his sensory function. During twenty 2-hour sessions, each passive and active tactile event was paired with a 0.5 second burst of 0.8mA VNS. Sensory function was measured before, halfway through, and after this therapy.RESULTS: The patient did not report any side effects during or following VNS+Tactile therapy. Quantitative measures revealed lasting and clinically meaningful improvements in tactile threshold, proprioception, and stereognosis. After VNS+Tactile therapy, the patient was able to detect tactile stimulation to his affected hand that was eight times less intense, identify the joint position of his fingers in the affected hand three times more often, and identify everyday objects using his affected hand seven times more often, compared to baseline.CONCLUSIONS: Sensory function significantly improved in this man following VNS paired with tactile stimulation. This approach merits further study in controlled clinical trials.

TI  - Validating a Solid-Static Single-Armed Male Prototype Tasked to Produce Dynamic Movement from the Shoulder Through the Preparation Phase
PY  - 2015
AB  - The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and validate a methodology to determine baseline measures during the preparation phase (PREP) of seated weight-bearing locomotion. In order to evaluate this methodology this study investigated the external movement produced by the shoulder joint-centre of the upper limb through a seated downward poling motion. A solid-static anatomically correct prototype was designed to produce isolated dynamic movement about a human's shoulder joint-centre; this particular investigation replicated the average male weighing 80kg having fixed elbow (135 degrees) and wrist-stick (45 degrees) angles, and dynamic shoulder start angles (-10 degrees, 0 degrees and +10 degrees to the horizon). The prototype was tasked to produce PREP; a phase identified in seated locomotion produced through a double poling fashion. Trajectory and reaction forces created through PREP were evaluated using a standard Newton-Euler mathematical model in conjunction with a 3-dimensional motion capture system and force plate. Trajectory data concluded that the prototype was of reliable and valid mechanical design producing near identical curves for all trials individually as well as combined averages. Evidence also indicated that all trials displayed similar reaction forces, which produced torque in an anticlockwise direction about the shoulder. Since the prototype is solid and designed to mimic the male upper limb data can be used to describe minimal reaction forces onto the shoulder joint produced from PREP. Understanding external forces at baseline measures allows for valid assumptions to be made or dismissed concerning internal forces within the human body. Dynamic biomechanical analysis requires assumptions involving internal and external parameters when producing a movement. The addition of PREP to the seated propulsion cycle is unclear identifying the need to investigate the biomechanics produced through this phase; full arm extension to pick-plant. This study has developed an improved model of the upper limb during seated double poling.

TI  - Validation of a Manually Oscillating Chair for In-The-Field Assessment of Dynamic Visual Acuity on Crewmembers Within Hours of Returning From Long-Duration Spaceflight
PY  - 2017
AB  - Long-duration spaceflight results in sensorimotor adaptations, which cause functional deficits during gravitational transitions, such as landing on a planetary surface after long-duration microgravity exposure. Both the vestibular system and the central nervous system are affected by gravitational transitions. These systems are responsible for coordinating head and eye movements via the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and go through an adaptation period upon exposure to microgravity. Consequently, they must also re-adapt to Earth's gravitational environment upon landing. This re-adaptation causes decrements in gaze control and dynamic visual acuity, with crewmembers reporting oscillopsia and blurred vision caused by retinal slip, or the inability to keep an image focused on their retina. This is thought to drive motion sickness symptoms experienced by most crewmembers following landing. Retinal slip can be estimated by dynamic visual acuity (DVA); visual acuity while in motion. Previously, DVA has been assessed in the laboratory where subjects walked at 6.4 km/hr on a motorized treadmill. Using this method, Peters et al. (2011) found that DVA is worsened in astronauts by an average of 0.75 eye-chart lines one day after landing. However, it is believed that re-adaptation occurs quickly and that DVA might be worse immediately upon re-exposure to a gravitational environment. Since many crewmembers are unable to walk safely upon landing, it was necessary to develop a method for replicating the vertical head movements associated with walking. In addition, the use of a chair to imitate the head displacement caused by walking isolates eye-head interactions without allowing for trunk and lower-body compensation, as seen with treadmill walking (Mulavara &amp; Bloomberg 2003). Therefore, a modality for assessing DVA in the field within a few hours of landing was developed. In this study, we validated the ability of a manually operated oscillating chair to reproduce the oscillatory frequency of walking on a treadmill. Healthy non-astronaut subjects (n=14) participated in one test session and completed three static (seated) and three dynamic (walking/oscillated) visual acuity tests. DVA was assessed using a motorized treadmill, an automated oscillating chair, and a manually operated chair, both developed in the Neuroscience Laboratory at JSC. The automated chair was motor-driven and set to oscillate vertically at 2 Hz with a vertical displacement of +/- 5 cm to simulate vertical translation while walking. The manually operated chair was oscillated vertically by a test operator to the beat of a metronome at 120 beats/min (2 Hz) and a vertical displacement of approximately +/- 5 cm. As the subject was oscillated, they were asked to discern the direction gap of Landolt-C optotypes of varying sizes and verbally reported the direction while an operator recorded their response using a gamepad. Subjects were outfitted with accelerometers (sampling rate = 128 Hz) on their head, trunk and lumbar spine. A fast Fourier transform was performed on the vertical trunk acceleration to compare the peak and spread of the distribution of oscillation frequencies for each oscillating condition. The spread of the frequency distribution for the manual chair was not significantly different from either the treadmill or the automated chair. However, all three conditions had similar non-zero standard error values, suggesting a variance in head movement frequency which may affect DVA. The average oscillation frequency of the manual chair (1.85 Hz) was significantly different (α=0.05) from that of treadmill walking (2.24 Hz), but not significantly different from that of the automated chair (1.85 Hz) and all three conditions had small standard errors (SEM = 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 Hz for manual, treadmill, and automated respectively). This implies that both chairs oscillate at a frequency below that of treadmill walking, but are comparable to each other and reproducible across sessions. Additionally, DVA scores did not vary significantly across conditions. The smaller spread values of the oscillating chairs' frequencies indicated mitigation of variation induced by locomotor strategies, which enables better examination of the issue of VOR adaptation. Furthermore, due to the deconditioned state of crewmembers in the initial hours after landing, it is easier to transport a manual bouncing chair into the field and safer to perform a vision test while seated in a chair versus walking on a treadmill. Therefore, the manually oscillating chair has been deemed to meet and exceed the DVA testing capabilities previously obtained by treadmill walking.

TI  - Validation of a multifunctional hybrid piezo / temperature sensor for process and structural health monitoring of CFRP structures
PY  - 2018
AB  - Within the last three years the authors developed a novel hybrid multifunctional piezo / temperature sensor concept for flow front, cure and structural health monitoring of composite parts. The basic idea was to place a number of piezo / temperature sensors on predefined positions over the RTM mould. In a first step the piezo sensors were operated as pressure sensors to monitor the flow front propagation in the mould. Once the whole pre-form was impregnated by the resin and curing starts, the impedance of the piezo sensors were measured over the time. The change in the impedance spectrum was used to determine the degree of cure. Finally, when the curing process was finished, all piezo sensors were co-cured on the surface of the part and remain on the part to be used for structural health monitoring either in passive mode as acoustic emission sensors or in active mode using guided ultrasonic waves. The multifunctional sensor was made of piezo disc in series to a PT100 temperature sensor used a shunt resistor. In order to measure the impedance of the Piezo a signal generator was connected to the ground electrode of the piezo and the PT100 temperature sensor. The current through the piezo was measured via the PT100. For actuation a frequency modulated chirp signal was used and the response voltage over the PT100 sensor was measured. Out of the FFT of the voltage response the impedance of the piezo sensor was determined. The characteristic of the developed sensor concept are: only one data acquisition unit for process and SHM is required, a high time resolution of the cure monitoring can be achieved, the use of a PT100 as shunt resistor allows the measurement of the temperature during the manufacturing and usage of the part, where the knowledge of the temperature distribution can be used for effective temperature compensation techniques during SHM with guided waves. Within this paper the authors presented the latest validation results of the developed sensor and monitoring concept on flat plates. Process parameters such as flow front propagation and degree of cure were successfully monitored during the production of the parts. Finally the ability of the co-cured sensor for passive acoustic emission monitoring for the occurrence of impacts and the detection, localization and quantification of the impact damages under varying temperature conditions using guided ultrasonic waves was demonstrated. © 2018 NDT.net.

TI  - Validation of electrolytic-liquid tilt sensors for human motion measurement.
PY  - 1997
AB  - The development of inexpensive, low-weight, no-invasive sensors that can be used to accurately measure human motion is important for the evaluation of biomechanical risk during a variety of industrial work activities. Electrolytic liquid tilt sensors that measure the angular position of an object relative to the gravitational force vector may provide a valuable means for assessing the postural demand of work tasks. For example, the biomechanical cost to the low back could be assessed during manual material handling activities, or the demand to the shoulders could be evaluated during overhead construction work. Tilt sensors were tested during static and dynamic activities, using isovelocity and isoacceleration dynamometers to move the sensor. The output voltage of the sensors was found to be linearly proportional to the angular deviation of the dynamometer within an 150 degree range (r > 0.99). During constant angular velocity and constant angular acceleration movements, the correlation between the output of the dynamometer and sensor was high and linearly dependent on angular position. Hence, the sensors are capable of accurate motion measurement during static and controlled dynamic movements. Because of the inertia of the liquid within the sensor, its output during sudden acceleration/deceleration may cause some artifact which requires more extensive investigation.

TI  - Validation of the Emotiv EPOC (R) EEG gaming systemfor measuring research quality auditory ERPs
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have proved useful in investigating the role of auditory processing in cognitive disorders such as developmental dyslexia, specific language impairment (SLI), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and autism. However, laboratory recordings of auditory ERPs can be lengthy, uncomfortable, or threatening for some participants-particularly children. Recently, a commercial gaming electroencephalography (EEG) system has been developed that is portable, inexpensive, and easy to set up. In this study we tested if auditory ERPs measured using a gaming EEG system(Emotiv EPOC (R), www.emotiv.com) were equivalent to those measured by a widely-used, laboratory-based, research EEG system(Neuroscan).Methods. We simultaneously recorded EEGs with the research and gaming EEG systems, whilst presenting 21 adults with 566 standard (1000 Hz) and 100 deviant (1200 Hz) tones under passive (non-attended) and active (attended) conditions. The onset of each tone was marked in the EEGs using a parallel port pulse (Neuroscan) or a stimulus-generated electrical pulse injected into the O1 and O2 channels (Emotiv EPOC (R)). These markers were used to calculate research and gaming EEG systemlate auditory ERPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 peaks) and the mismatch negativity (MMN) in active and passive listening conditions for each participant.Results. Analyses were restricted to frontal sites as these are most commonly reported in auditory ERP research. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) indicated that the morphology of the research and gaming EEG system late auditory ERP waveforms were similar across all participants, but that the research and gaming EEG system MMN waveforms were only similar for participants with non-noisy MMN waveforms (N = 11 out of 21). Peak amplitude and latency measures revealed no significant differences between the size or the timing of the auditory P1, N1, P2, N2, P3, and MMN peaks.Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the gaming EEG system may prove a valid alternative to laboratory ERP systems for recording reliable late auditory ERPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, and the P3) over the frontal cortices. In the future, the gaming EEG system may also prove useful for measuring less reliable ERPs, such as the MMN, if the reliability of such ERPs can be boosted to the same level as late auditory ERPs.

TI  - Validation of the Emotiv EPOC EEG system for research quality auditory event-related potentials in children
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background. Previous work has demonstrated that a commercial gaming electroencephalography (EEG) system, Emotiv EPOC, can be adjusted to provide valid auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults that are comparable to ERPs recorded by a research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan. The aim of the current study was to determine if the same was true for children.Method. An adapted Emotiv EPOC system and Neuroscan system were used to make simultaneous EEG recordings in nineteen 6-to 12-year-old children under "passive" and "active" listening conditions. In the passive condition, children were instructed to watch a silent DVD and ignore 566 standard (1,000 Hz) and 100 deviant (1,200 Hz) tones. In the active condition, they listened to the same stimuli, and were asked to count the number of `high' (i.e., deviant) tones.Results. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) indicated that the ERP morphology recorded with the two systems was very similar for the P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERP peaks (r =.82 to.95) in both passive and active conditions, and less so, though still strong, for mismatch negativity ERP component (MMN; r =.67 to.74). There were few differences between peak amplitude and latency estimates for the two systems.Conclusions. An adapted EPOC EEG system can be used to index children's late auditory ERP peaks (i.e., P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) and theirMMNERP component.

TI  - Validity and Repeatability of a Novel Dynamic Visual Acuity System
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose. In many sports, athletes rely on visual information from the environment to perform. Some literature suggests athletes have superior visual abilities to non-athletes, particularly on tasks representative of the visual demands of their sport, such as dynamic acuity, eye movement accuracy and speed, and peripheral vision. Other literature suggests there is no difference between athletes and non-athletes, at least when standard clinical assessments are employed. A limitation of the literature is that almost none of the research has been conducted with standardized, validated tools. This is partly caused by a lack of readily available tools to measure tasks representative of the visual demands of sport, and available tests have typically not been validated against current clinical standards. The purpose of this study is to examine the validity and repeatability of a novel visual acuity system (moV & V&MP Vision Suite) recently developed in the Vision & Motor Performance Lab (V&MP). moV& permits the measurement of many visual function parameters including dynamic visual acuity with predictable, random, and jittering target motion.Methods. Twenty-five participants attended two study visits, separated by a minimum of 2 weeks. At each visit, static and dynamic visual acuity was measured using Snellen, ETDRS, and moV& charts. Static visual acuities were compared to determine the validity of moV&, and both static and dynamic visual acuities were compared between visits to determine the test-retest repeatability.Results. moV& static visual acuities are clinically similar to visual acuities measured with the ETDRS chart (moV&, -0.09 +/- 0.13; ETDRS, -0.03 +/- 0.11, concordance correlation coefficient 0.726). Additionally, all static, dynamic, and jitter visual acuities demonstrate good testYretest repeatability (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient range 0.451-0.953).Conclusions. moV& provides good clinical measures of static visual acuity that are comparable to both Snellen and ETDRS measures. Dynamic visual acuity measures demonstrate good testYretest repeatability.

TI  - Validity of using tri-axial accelerometers to measure human movement-Part I: Posture and movement detection
PY  - 2014
AB  - A robust method for identifying movement in the free-living environment is needed to objectively measure physical activity. The purpose of this study was to validate the identification of postural orientation and movement from acceleration data against visual inspection from video recordings. Using tri-axial accelerometers placed on the waist and thigh, static orientations of standing, sitting, and lying down, as well as dynamic movements of walking, jogging and transitions between postures were identified. Additionally, subjects walked and jogged at self-selected slow, comfortable, and fast speeds. Identification of tasks was performed using a combination of the signal magnitude area, continuous wavelet transforms and accelerometer orientations. Twelve healthy adults were studied in the laboratory, with two investigators identifying tasks during each second of video observation. The intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability were greater than 0.95 for all activities except for transitions. Results demonstrated high validity, with sensitivity and positive predictive values of greater than 85% for sitting and lying, with walking and jogging identified at greater than 90%. The greatest disagreement in identification accuracy between the algorithm and video occurred when subjects were asked to fidget while standing or sitting. During variable speed tasks, gait was correctly identified for speeds between 0.1 m/s and 4.8 m/s. This study included a range of walking speeds and natural movements such as fidgeting during static postures, demonstrating that accelerometer data can be used to identify orientation and movement among the general population.

TI  - Value of continuous passive motion in total knee arthroplasty
PY  - 1990
AB  - Two methods of rehabilitation after 91 total knee arthroplasties in 74 patients were reviewed. Patients in each group were well matched for age, sex, and diagnosis. Forty-four knees in 39 patients were treated with conventional physiotherapy, consisting of 3 days of immobilization followed by a program of active assisted range-of-motion exercises. Forty-seven knees in 41 patients were placed in a continuous passive motion machine immediately after operation. Other aspects of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care were identical in both groups. Patients in the continuous passive motion group were found to have a lower incidence of complications, especially of wound healing problems and thromboembolic disease. Analgesic use in patients in the continuous passive motion group was reduced. Straight leg raising was achieved slightly earlier in patients in the continuous passive motion group (4.9 days) compared with patients not treated with continuous passive motion (5.2 days). Although the range of motion of the knee at discharge from the hospital in patients in the continuous passive motion group was greater (91°) compared with patients not treated with continuous passive motion (81°), the range of motion in both groups at ultimate follow up was equivalent. However, when knee-rating scores were considered, patients treated with continuous passive motion averaged 9 points higher on a 100-point scale than patients not treated with continuous passive motion. In addition, the length of hospital stay for patients in the continuous passive motion group was 2.1 days shorter. We concluded that continuous passive motion was an effective adjunct to physiotherapy in the postoperative care of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The benefits included improved wound healing, a decreased number of thromboembolic events, decreased analgesic use, and a higher ultimate knee score. We also concluded that the use of continuous passive motion had little effect on the ultimate range of motion of the knee after arthroplasty.

TI  - Value of coronary arteriography and selective angiography in the diagnosis of cardiac hydatid cysts
PY  - 1983
AB  - Sixteen patients with one more hydatid cysts (HC) were investigated by angiography (5 with coronary arteriography) over a 10 year period. There were 8 men and 8 women, with a low mean age of 23 years (including the youngest reported case: 2 years of age). 25 HC were detected, localized in the left ventricle in 3 out of 4 cases. Hemodynamic investigation included left and right heart catheterisation with pressure recordings, preceded by an exploratory injection of contrast medium in the superior vena cava to detect subendocardial cysts. Selective angiogrphy was then performed depending on the cardiac chamber involved. The principal changes, depending on the radiological incidence, the volume of the cyst, its localization within the thickness of the myocardium and the site of the cyst cavity - are represented by one direct sign - the lacune of Canabal, and several indirect signs, some static - deformation and cavity shift and exceptionally an image of addition - others dynamic - movement, paradoxical movement, impaired chamber filling or evacuation. In addition, coronary arteriography showed radiological abnormalities of the main coronary arteries - deviation, kinking, bulding and, for the first time, compression of the coronary vessels. The pericystic 'halo' and myographic 'ring' were also valuable pathognomonic signs. The authors suggest that catheterisation and selective angiography with coronary arteriography should be included in the work up of patients suspected of cardiac HC for confirmation of the diagnosis, localisation, assessment of the size and intramyocardial situation and to determine the precise relationship to the main coronary vessels before surgical intervention, mandatory in view of the poor spontaneous prognosis of cardiac HC.

TI  - Variability of Channel Response and Acoustic System Performance: Simulation Study
PY  - 2013
AB  - simulating realistic sonar data is essential for tuning detection and classification algorithms in active and passive sonar signal processing according to environment and acquisition characteristics. Robustness of performances estimation and prediction applications can be greatly enhanced if the real ocean environments can be placed as input data to the simulation. The Ocean environment presents a difficult channel for acoustic propagation because of its frequency dependent large and small-scale fading, signal spreading in time and frequency, and extended multipath. Its characteristics vary from place to place and with time over scales ranging from seconds to years. Any system that uses Acoustics in its operation is affected by this channel variability. System performance and availability for every condition of the channel thus requires that these should be evaluated and incorporated. In the present work data for the channel in terms of its bathymetry, SSP and sea surface winds have been taken for the year 2011 and the channel response on monthly averages have been calculated. Performance of a passive acoustic system has been evaluated by simulation on these and predictions of the system performance have been obtained for the full year. In this way system level design can be optimized for the prevailing channel conditions.

TI  - Variability of zonation patterns in temperate microtidal Uruguayan beaches with different morphodynamic types
PY  - 1997
AB  - Early studies on sandy beach zonation patterns have shown rather rigid schemes. Recent work has suggested that zonation changes with morphodynamic type and, in dissipative beaches, it also changes through time. This last finding leads to the conclusion that at least 1 yr of study is necessary to understand zonation patterns in dissipative sandy beaches. Here we report a 1 yr study (from March 1994 to March 1995) of 4 microtidal beaches with different morphodynamic types situated on the Atlantic coast of Uruguay. We show that zonation patterns (number of zones or belts) can change through time regardless of beach type. However, the morphodynamic characteristics of the beach seem to affect how frequently the zonation pattern can change by fusion or subdivision of zones, and which zones are involved in those processes. In beaches with flat slopes (toward the dissipative extremity), the lower zones were frequently fused and divided. The same occurred with the medium and upper zones in the beaches with steeper slopes (towards the reflective extremity). Our results suggest that spatial variability of the macrofauna is related to variability in the position of the swash zone, which in turn depends on beach slope and width. Variability of species distribution would also depend on morphological adaptations of organisms to move in such environments. We suggest 2 mechanisms of species movement to explain the variability in species distribution observed in this study: Swash Mediated Active Movement (SMAM) and Autonomous Active Movement (AAM). The first mechanism involves both an active and a passive component. AAM is independent of swash movements and affects species distribution on the upper levels of the beach.

TI  - Varus thrust and knee frontal plane dynamic motion in persons with knee osteoarthritis
PY  - 2013
AB  - Objective: Varus thrust visualized during walking is associated with a greater medial knee load and an increased risk of medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. Little is known about how varus thrust presence determined by visual observation relates to quantitative gait kinematic data. We hypothesized that varus thrust presence is associated with greater knee frontal plane dynamic movement during the stance phase of gait.Methods: Participants had knee OA in at least one knee. Trained examiners assessed participants for varus thrust presence during ambulation. Frontal plane knee motion during ambulation was captured using external passive reflective markers and an 8-camera motion analysis system. To examine the crosssectional relationship between varus thrust and frontal plane knee motion, we used multivariable regression models with the quantitative motion measures as dependent variables and varus thrust (present/absent) as predictor; models were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), gait speed, and knee static alignment.Results: 236 persons [mean BMI: 28.5 kg/m(2) (standard deviation (SD) 5.5), mean age: 64.9 years (SD 10.4), 75.8% women] contributing 440 knees comprised the study sample. 82 knees (18.6%) had definite varus thrust. Knees with varus thrust had greater peak varus angle and greater peak varus angular velocity during stance than knees without varus thrust (mean differences 0.90 degrees and 6.65 degrees/s, respectively). These patterns remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, gait speed, and knee static alignment.Conclusion: Visualized varus thrust during walking was associated with a greater peak knee varus angular velocity and a greater peak knee varus angle during stance phase of gait.

PY  - 1970
AB  - 128 undergraduates viewed either a stationary or a moving illuminated arc line in 1 of 4 conditions: no static visual noise or 5%, 25%, or 45% static visual noise. The visual noise consisted of randomly placed light circles of 1-cm diameter optically superimposed on the surface of the disk on which the arc line was located. An analysis of variance based on the median magnitude estimates of arc length yielded no significant noise effect, but a significant static/dynamic effect indicating contraction with movement (the Ansbacher effect). Results are discussed in relation to other research on the Ansbacher effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Vascular function, exercise-induced hyperemia, and antioxidant supplementation in chronic heart failure patients and heart transplant recipients
PY  - 2011
AB  - The overall objective of this dissertation was to provide greater insight into changes in vascular function, blood flow regulation, and exercise-induced hyperemia associated with health, chronic heart failure (CHF), and heart transplantation (HTx). In the first study, we aimed to determine the central and peripheral contributions to movement-induced hyperemia in response to passive movement by comparing humans with a denervated heart (HTx) to intact controls. We observed a four-fold reduction in the transient increase in femoral blood volume entering the leg in response to passive limb movement in the HTx recipients compared to controls. These findings highlight the key role of the reflex increases in heart rate (HR) and the associated rise in cardiac output (CO) response as an important mechanism which contributes to movement-induced hyperemia in humans. The second study investigated the changes in vascular function and the role of oxidative stress from health to CHF, HTx, and beyond. Utilizing flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) we documented reduced vasodilatory capacity in CHF patients, which was normalized in early HTx recipients, and then an eventual decline in vascular function in the HTx recipients that were the furthest time from transplantation (>14 yrs post-HTx). The acute ingestion of the antioxidant cocktail (AOC) was able to significantly increase FMD by 55% in these >14 yrs post-HTx recipients suggesting that free radicals, and the associated decrease in nitric oxide bioavailability, are largely responsible for their endothelial dysfunction. The third study sought to better characterize the role of free radicals in regulating central and peripheral hemodynamics at rest and during exercise in patients with CHF using an oral AOC and dynamic handgrip exercise. The ingestion of the AOC had significant systemic hemodynamic effects which were only evident in the patients with CHF. Specifically, the AOC further reduced the patients already lower MAP (∼5%), increased CO (∼10%), and caused a fall in systemic vascular resistance (∼12%). These data imply that systemic vascular resistance appears, at least in part, to be free radically-mediated. Collectively, this research has provided significant insight into the cardiovascular consequences of CHF and HTx in terms of oxidative stress, vascular function and hemodynamic regulation.

AB  - In their everyday life, people interact with different objects, static as well as those in motion. However, dynamic acuity is rarely checked in medical examinations, even those preceding the issue of driving license. In order for driving to be safe, good eyesight or good correction with visual aids is imperative. Beside good eyesight, drivers also have to have good reflexes and short reaction span. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic and static visual acuity in order to observe how they vary among individuals. Twenty female and male participants, 65 years of age, took part in the study and the comparison was made with the results provided by 20 20-year old participants. Dynamic acuity was tested using the Landolt-ring optotype which was simulating movement velocity of 72 km/h. T-test demonstrated the presence of a statistically significant difference between dynamic and static acuity among the participants from 62 to 68 years of age (t= 15.852; df=39; p<0.01). Within the same group, dynamic acuity (mean=0.887; std. deviation=0.297) proved to be significantly worse than static acuity (mean=1.40; std. deviation=0.317). By comparing the results measured within the older group of participants with those measured in the younger group, it was shown that there exists a statistically significant difference (t=0.275; df=58; p<0,05) between the older and younger group in their dynamic binocular acuity with correction. Younger participants had better dynamic binocular acuity with correction (mean=1.063; std. deviation =0.259) than the older participants (mean=0.884; std. deviation=0.298). The differences between dynamic and static acuity and its degradation in the older age groups have to be taken into account when issuing driving licenses. The future of research lies within the study of correlation between the age and acuity in order that the results can be applied in practice.

TI  - Vector Disparity Sensor with Vergence Control for Active Vision Systems
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper presents an architecture for computing vector disparity for active vision systems as used on robotics applications. The control of the vergence angle of a binocular system allows us to efficiently explore dynamic environments, but requires a generalization of the disparity computation with respect to a static camera setup, where the disparity is strictly 1-D after the image rectification. The interaction between vision and motor control allows us to develop an active sensor that achieves high accuracy of the disparity computation around the fixation point, and fast reaction time for the vergence control. In this contribution, we address the development of a real-time architecture for vector disparity computation using an FPGA device. We implement the disparity unit and the control module for vergence, version, and tilt to determine the fixation point. In addition, two on-chip different alternatives for the vector disparity engines are discussed based on the luminance (gradient-based) and phase information of the binocular images. The multiscale versions of these engines are able to estimate the vector disparity up to 32 fps on VGA resolution images with very good accuracy as shown using benchmark sequences with known ground-truth. The performances in terms of frame-rate, resource utilization, and accuracy of the presented approaches are discussed. On the basis of these results, our study indicates that the gradient-based approach leads to the best trade-off choice for the integration with the active vision system.

TI  - Vehicle Active Motion Controls
PY  - 2015
AB  - The vehicle active motion controls with additional front and/or rear wheel active steer and direct yaw moment control (DYC) by transversal split control of tire longitudinal forces are dealt with in this chapter. Together with some introduction of the rear wheel steer controls at the early stage of the developments, zero side slip control by the rear wheel active steer controls are introduced. The feed-forward type and feed-forward+feedback type of response model following rear wheel steer controls are discussed. Next the feed-forward type of additional front and rear wheel active steer control is introduced to show that any form of side slip and yaw rate responses to steering wheel input are available by the active steer control. Following the explanations of the passive DYC by differential controls, the feed-forward and feed-forward+feedback type of model following controls as well as zero side slip DYC are studied. A practical advantage of DYC compared with the other active steer controls for the vehicle motion control especially under severe conditions is also discussed.

TI  - Vehicle detection using active and passive sensors
PY  - 2014
AB  - To detect vehicles on road, a vehicle detection method based on active and passive vision was proposed. The system contained two stages, hypothesis generation (HG) and hypothesis verification (HV). In the HG stage, the active sensor, microwave radar was used to detect and track the targets. First the NN clustering method was used to deal with the radar data, and then under the framework of multiple hypothesis tracking, the observations and predictions calculated by Kalman were associated to obtain the radar targets. In the HV stage, the newly appeared radar targets were used to find regions of interests (ROIs) in image, and the vehicles were detected by verifying the ROIs through a classifier trained offline. Lots of experiments were conducted on the platform of intelligent vehicle in the lab. The results suggest that for both city and country roads, this method can effectively detect and track target vehicles and can get the targets' range and speed, which can help the platform achieve more functions. ©, 2014, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

TI  - Vehicle's motion detection: Influence of road layout and relation with visual driver's assessment
PY  - 1999
AB  - The vehicle's motion detection with concurrent self motion is an important dynamic task concerning vehicle's collision avoidance. Ln this paper we present empirical data relating this task with environmental and individual factors such as: (a) different kinds of road pavements (bituminous, concrete and bituminous pavement with chromatic bands); (b) several measures traditionally used in driver's assessment, e.g. vision parameters and reaction times; (c) age and sex of drivers. One hundred and six persons participated in this study. Using computer generated images with realistic textures, we simulated a situation where participants had to detect a vehicle's motion. All participants were also tested in several measures used traditionally in drivers' assessment such as vision and reaction time tests. The vehicle's motion detection was more impaired in the situation of a pavement with chromatic bands, which is the pavement with the higher optical flow density. These results showed that the optical flow played a more important role than the contrast between the object (vehicle) and the background (road) for visual motion detection tasks. Concerning the drivers assessment we point out the need of giving more importance to visual dynamic tests, contrast acuity and dazzling recovery time. Traditional tests of static visual acuity and reaction times should have less weight. Relatively to the sex and age variables the results showed that the relation between age and the vehicle's motion detection is different for females and males. Females give fewer errors than males, but with age increment they need more time to detect the vehicle's motion. Males need less time to detect a vehicle's motion but with age they give more errors than females. From an ecological point of view, both behaviours reveal a negative effect of age on the vehicle's motion detection because a wrong detection could be as dangerous as a slow detection.

TI  - Velocity Attenuation of Granular Debris Flows During Impact on Rigid Barriers
PY  - 2017
AB  - Effective design of rigid debris-resisting barriers remains a challenging problem for practitioners. At present, a pseudo-static approach is commonly used for the estimation of debris impact loads acting on barriers. In this approach, the dynamic impact pressure is estimated using the hydrodynamic equation and an assumed value of the dynamic pressure coefficient. The bulk density and travel velocity of the landslide debris are also required for the calculations. To this end, the debris velocity under free-field conditions can be obtained from a conventional debris mobility assessment. A limitation of this approach is that it ignores the attenuation of the debris' velocity during the deposition process behind the barrier. To provide a scientific basis for assessing the velocity of granular debris flows during impact on rigid barriers, this paper presents results of debris velocity from a laboratory study of debris-barrier interaction using physical flume modelling. High-speed cameras were used to capture the dynamic motion of the flowing debris. The images obtained were analysed using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique to estimate the velocity of the debris. The results show that, following the first stage of impact, the accumulated debris behind the model barrier formed a stationary zone and caused the remaining debris to slow down in a run-up process. As a result, the peak debris momentum was 30% lower compared to that observed under free-field conditions. The findings of this study will allow practitioners to optimise the design of debris-resisting barriers in the future.

TI  - Ventilatory and circulatory responses at the onset of dominant and non-dominant limb exercise
PY  - 2007
AB  - We compared the ventilatory and circulatory responses during 20 s of light dynamic leg and arm exercises performed separately using dominant and non-dominant limbs. Seventeen subjects performed a 20-s single-leg knee extension-flexion exercise with a load of 5% of maximal muscle strength attached to the ankle. Fifteen of the seventeen subjects also did a single-arm elbow flexion-extension exercise in which a load was attached to the wrist in the same way as in the leg exercise. Similar movements were passively performed on the subjects by experimenters to avoid the effects of central command. The magnitude of change from rest (gain) in minute ventilation during passive movement (PAS) was significantly smaller in the dominant limbs than in the non-dominant limbs, though a significant difference was not detected during voluntary exercise (VOL). In contrast, heart rate and blood pressure responses did not show any differences between the dominant and non-dominant limbs during either VOL or PAS. In conclusion, the initial ventilatory response to PAS in the dominant limbs was lower than that of the non-dominant limbs, though the ventilatory response to VOL was not. Circulatory responses were not different between the dominant and non-dominant limbs. These results suggest that peripheral neural reflex during exercise could be different between dominant and non-dominant limbs and that ventilatory response at the onset of exercise might be controlled by the dual neural modulation of central command and peripheral neural reflex, resulting in the same ventilatory response to both dominant and non-dominant limb exercise.

TI  - Verbesserte strukturidentifizierung mittels Gewebe-Doppler- Echokardiographie
PY  - 1998
AB  - Tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) has been shown to be of particular value in patients with impaired myocardial function. Recently, the technique was successfully employed to localize the ventricular insertion of accessory atrioventricular pathways. The identification of abnormal cardiac structures is coming up now as a new field of clinical interest. The purpose of this study was to differentiate anomalous cardiac and aortic from native structures by physical properties of tissue motion using transesophageal TDE. Characteristic motion patterns of anomalous structures have not been described in detail and tissue Doppler findings have not been associated with clinical features up to now. Forty consecutive patients were included after anomalous cardiac or vascular structures had been detected by conventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A control group consisted of 20 subjects. Rapidity of diagnosis in anomalous structures was divided into 3 categories, and TDE signals were related to particular pathology by a blinded, 2nd observer. Three different motion patterns could be defined: incoherent motion due to free oscillation of an anomalous structure which is independent of the surrounding tissue (Figure 1b); coherent motion with a phase difference meaning that motion depends on the motion of the surrounding tissue but is out of phase (Figure 2); concordant motion showing no difference in direction, velocity, or phase of motion compared with the surrounding tissue. Incoherent motion was present in endocarditic vegetations, 4th degree aortic plaques, Chiari network, valvular prolapse, intracavitary tumors, and freely oscillating thrombi as well as in normal valve leaflets and papillary muscles. Especially if endocarditic vegetations are present its incoherent motion facilitates to recognize these small structures. The colorcode of this motion pattern demarcates the vegetation reliably from the surrounding tissue (Figure 1b). Within 15 seconds vegetations could be detected in 9 (82%) vs 2 (18%) patients employing only conventional imaging. Using conventional echocardiographic approaches detection of vegetations is frequently hindered by their small size and minor echo intensity (Figure 1a). In contrast, size and echo intensity do not affect the tissue Doppler signal. Normal papillary muscles and distal portions of the mitral and tricuspid valves were demonstrated to regularly meet the criterion of incoherent tissue motion in the control group. In part, this was also observed with respect to the aortic and pulmonary valves. In valvular tissue incoherent motion was caused by passive floating, whereas papillary muscles show an active inverse motion for short time intervals. Nevertheless, physiologic incoherent motion did not lead to any false differential diagnosis. The phase difference of coherent motion results from damped oscillation. This phenomenon was visualized by tissue Doppler M-mode in 5 thrombi of the left atrial appendage (LAA) (100%) and in 1 ventricular thrombus (50% of all clots). Concordant motion was shown in 3rd degree aortic plaques and postrheumatic and calcified vegetations. These structures were found to be completely embedded or closely attached, so that their passive motion corresponded to the motion of the surrounding regular tissue. Detection and assessment of anomalous structures are based on their motion patterns which can be synchronous or asynchronous in comparison with the surrounding tissue. Another goal of this investigation was to test if the sensitivity of TEE to spontaneous echo contrast can be improved using TDE. In 21 patients presenting with left atrial dilation (left atrial diameter > 44 mm) due to mitral stenosis (n=8), mitral regurge (n=5), arterial hypertension (n=5) and multiple valvular disease (n=3) fundamental multiplane TEE and transesophageal TDE were performed with standardized gain setting. The control group consisted of 20 randomized individuals with normal left atrial size (left atrial diameter < 40 mm). Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was defined as low-intensity echoes moving slowly in a circular or spiral shape within the left atrial cavity. Assessment of TDE and fundamental images were performed each by another blinded observer. In the patients group left atrial spontaneous contrast could be detected in 19% using conventional TEE vs 71% employing transesophageal TDE (p < 0.01) (Figures 3 and 4). In the control group no left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was observed. In conclusion, we propose a classification of anomalous tissue motion patterns differentiating incoherent motion, coherent motion with a phase difference, and concordant motion. The presence of incoherent motion expedites detection of endocarditis. The detection of phase differences in motion increases diagnostic certainty in thrombus formation in the LAA. In calcified or completely enveloped structures TDE is not more sensitive than TEE. In addition, TDE improves the detection of left atrial spontaneous echo contrast. It allows the visualization of low-intensity echos moving slowly in a circular or spiral shape even if spontaneous contrast cannot be recognized using conventional imaging. Thus, spontaneous echo contrast is becoming a more sensitive diagnostic criteria.

TI  - Verification and implementation of dynamic wedge calculations in a treatment planning system based on a dose-to-energy-fluence formalism
PY  - 1996
AB  - The use of dynamic movements on linear accelerators during irradiation has found a revised interest lately due to the integration of computers to control the accelerator. In this paper, dynamic wedge fields that are produced by moving one of the collimator blocks during irradiation are studied. Since these wedge fields differ from those of mechanical wedges, certain requirements are to be met on the treatment planning system. A pencil-beam-based treatment planning system that uses the resultant energy fluence distribution from the dynamic collimator movement has been extensively reviewed. In calculations, the system treats the dynamic collimated held as a single, modulated field that yields calculation times close to those for open beams. Details are given on the theoretical model used for the calculation of dynamically generated dose distributions. Measurements of depth doses, profiles, and output factors in dynamic wedge fields indicate that calculations accurately predict the outcome from dynamic wedges without any additional measurements other than those used for characterization of static open beams.

TI  - Verstauchungstraumen der Fingerendgelenke. Rationelles Vorgehen bei der Behandlung
PY  - 2007
AB  - Injuries to the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) of the finger are frequent, due to its exposition during sports or manual activity. The following injury patterns can be distinguished: Avulsion of either the extensor or flexor tendons with or without a bony fragment. Ligamentous abruption of the collateral ligament system and/or the palmar plate and intraarticular fractures as well as fracture dislocations. A subtile clinical and radiological investigation is an inevitable requirement for an exact diagnosis and the adequate therapy regimen. Injuries to the collateral ligament system and/or the palmar plate are usually treated conservatively. Early active motion is preferred in partial ligament leasions with a stable joint, whereas static splinting is used for combined injuries, which result in an unstable joint, due to lateral or palmar stresses. Large bony fragments, which are displaced should be fixed operatively. 4 types of extensor tendon injuries at the DIP level can be described: Type 1 and 3 include a tearing off with or without a bony fragment of the extensor tendon at the distal phalanx. Type 2 is a rupture of the tendon proximal to its insertion at the distal phalanx. These injuries can be treated conservatively with a static splint that immobilizes the PIP and DIP joint for at least 6 weeks. Type 4 presents a fracture dislocation of the DIP joint with a large dorsal fragment (more than 1/3 of the articular surface), which causes instability of the joint and subluxation of the distal phalanx. Operative treatment is required for these injuries with either closed reduction percutaneous pinning (Ishiguro technique) or open reduction and k-wire fixation. Injuries to the flexor tendon system can be distinguished as follows: Type 1 is a tendinous avulsion of the profundus tendon. Type 2 is a bony avulsion of the profundus tendon with a small chip fracture. Type 3 is a large bony avulsion with a concomitant subluxation of the DIP joint. All these injuries of the flexor system require operative treatment with reinsertion of the flexor tendon at the distal phalanx. For displaced intraarticular fractures at the DIP level closed reduction, percutaneous pinning or open reduction pin and screw fixation are the treatment of choice. A retrospective follow-up examination of 148 patients with 150 extensor tendon injuries at the DIP level, treated with static splinting, resulted in very good results in 47% and good results in 42% of all patients. 7% achieved a fair and another 4% a poor result. A comparison of percutaneous (Ishiguro) and open treatment of type 4 extensor tendon injuries (palmar fracture dislocation) turned out decreased active range of motion in the open treatment group. According the pain level 11 out of 12 patients were pain free in the percutaneous group, and 19 out of 25 in the open group respectively. Clinical symptoms following trauma to the DIP joint often are minor, and therefore underestimated. Nevertheless exact diagnosis and adequat treatment is necessary to avoid painful dysfunction of this tiny joint.

TI  - Vertical Array Passive Geo-Acoustic Inversion in Range-Dependent Environments
PY  - 2009
AB  - Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) is often conducted in littoral, shallow-water areas, where hostile subsurface enemies pose a constant threat and where seabed geophysical properties are complicated, and to a great extent unknown to us. Accurate estimates of seabed interface roughness and sediment geophysical properties are critical for proper prediction of sensor and weapon system performance. In the absence of good seabed characterization, tactical mission planning is seldom optimal or efficient. Current data collection survey techniques for geo-acoustic bottom characteristics are expensive, time consuming, and they suffer from time latency (months to years) between collection, processing, analysis, and tactical use.In response to this problem, the Space and Naval Systems Command and the Naval Air Systems Command have investigated several new inversion techniques to characterize littoral seabed sediments. Most of these techniques use an active sonar approach that is not covert and is usually limited to seabed areas near the receiver. Purely passive techniques offer the potential to remain covert and greatly extend the coverage of the seabed characterization.The research described here concerns a new set of algorithms called Passive Geo-Acoustic Inversion Techniques (PGAIT) that act on passive acoustic signals and thus allow non-provocative operations in forward areas and geo-acoustic characterization at ranges well beyond a local footprint. PGAIT uses coherent and incoherent matched-field processing on signals from passing ships received on a vertical aperture in shallow water. There is no need to know the source spectrum. Broadband and temporal averaging techniques are used to reduce ambiguities and to increase the output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The algorithms are robust to environmental mismatch and usually produce an output with at least 10 dB SNR, which is sufficient to identify sediment types. A key element of PGAIT is to consider a range-dependent environment as a sequence of range-independent slabs. The performance of PGAIT is demonstrated at frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz in several sediment conditions, ranging from very soft to very hard.The results show that: 1) the vertical aperture should contain at least 3 hydrophones per wavelength to ensure high quality inversions; 2) coherent (phase-only) matched-field processing outperforms standard intensity processing by about 2 dB in good input SNR conditions; 3) incorrect assumptions about the sound-speed profile (e.g., a bias or incorrect mixed-layer-depth) do not significantly affect the inversion results; and 4) the new range-independent slab approach is computationally intensive, but it can resolve discrete sediment boundary discontinuities.

TI  - Vertical Migrations of a Deep-Sea Fish and Its Prey
PY  - 2014
AB  - It has been speculated that some deep-sea fishes can display large vertical migrations and likely doing so to explore the full suite of benthopelagic food resources, especially the pelagic organisms of the deep scattering layer (DSL). This would help explain the success of fishes residing at seamounts and the increased biodiversity found in these features of the open ocean. We combined active plus passive acoustic telemetry of blackspot seabream with in situ environmental and biological (backscattering) data collection at a seamount to verify if its behaviour is dominated by vertical movements as a response to temporal changes in environmental conditions and pelagic prey availability. We found that seabream extensively migrate up and down the water column, that these patterns are cyclic both in short-term (tidal, diel) as well as long-term (seasonal) scales, and that they partially match the availability of potential DSL prey components. Furthermore, the emerging pattern points to a more complex spatial behaviour than previously anticipated, suggesting a seasonal switch in the diel behaviour mode (benthic vs. pelagic) of seabream, which may reflect an adaptation to differences in prey availability. This study is the first to document the fine scale three-dimensional behaviour of a deep-sea fish residing at seamounts.

TI  - Vertical gate vibrations at the exit of the pipe turbine diffuser
PY  - 1999
AB  - The static and dynamic behaviour of an emergency gate situated downstream of a horizontal-shaft turbine was studied on a physical model. The static behaviour of the gate was transferred to prototype conditions using Froude's law of similitude. The analysis and transfer of the dynamic movements of the gate, however, turned out to be much more complex than expected. In particular, we studied the behaviour of the emergency gate for the case of disconnection of the power unit from the system or breakdown of the guide vane system. We used analytical methods both in the time domain and in the frequency domain (FFT, correlation analysis). The evaluation of the experimental data showed that several vibration modes could be distinguished depending on the gate opening. Natural vibrations characterised a first zone, corresponding to relatively small gate openings. As the gate opening increased, the vibration behaviour of the gate became increasingly dependent on the swirl pulsations of the turbine. The experimental data was verified using mathematical models.

TI  - Vertical head translation impairs dynamic visual acuity during near viewing
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dynamic visual acuity is an important clinical tool for assessment of the rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR). It is based on the fact that the normal rVORstabilizes vision and maintains visual acuity during head rotation. The translational VOR (tVOR) generates eye movements during linear head motion. Studies in humans have shown that gaze stabilization during translation is incomplete and that there is a strong effect of the visual environment: eye velocity is much greater in the light than in the dark. In this study, we measured visual acuity during vertical translation in 11 subjects and asked whether a more complex visual background would enhance the response and improve acuity. During 2Hz whole-body translation, tumbling-E optotypes (0.0-0.9 logMAR in steps of 0.1 logMAR, six trials of each size randomly ordered) were flashed on a screen that was 30 cm in front of the subject's eyes. The subject reported the optotype's orientation with a joystick. Based on a threshold of 75% trials correctly identified, the group dynamic acuity was 0.72 logMAR, compared to a static acuity of 0.0 logMAR. When the background was enhanced with a stationary dot pattern, dynamic acuity improved to 0.42 logMAR. Our findings show that vertical head translation degrades vision more than head rotation. This may limit the use of dynamic acuity as a clinical measure of otolith function.

TI  - Vertical movements through subsurface stream sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates during experimental drying are influenced by sediment characteristics and species traits
PY  - 2017
AB  - Streambed drying is becoming more common due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic water resource pressures. Subsurface sediments are a potential refuge for benthic macroinvertebrates during drying events in temporary streams. Sediment characteristics are important controls on the distribution of macroinvertebrates in subsurface habitats, but difficulties making observations impedes quantification of vertical movements. Species traits (e.g. subsurface habitat affinity) also influence vertical movements of macroinvertebrates into the subsurface sediments, but most species-specific responses remain uncharacterised. Transparent artificial mesocosms were used to directly observe the vertical movements of individuals of three aquatic insect nymphs and two crustaceans. Mixtures of three types of transparent sediment of varying particle size were combined to produce six treatments with differing interstitial pore volumes and, hence, differing subsurface porosity. Macroinvertebrate vertical movements were measured during incremental reductions in water level from 5cm above to 20cm below the sediment surface. These species comprised a variety of trait categories including feeding group, species affinity to temporary streams and subsurface habitats. Active and passive vertical movements were determined by conducting experiments with both live individuals and their cadavers. Sediment treatment influenced the vertical movements of individuals as reducing subsurface porosity decreased vertical movements for most species. Vertical movement into subsurface sediments in response to water level reduction was the result of active, not passive, movements for all species. Species identity influenced the vertical movements made by individuals. Nemoura cambrica had the highest affinity for temporary streams and subsurface habitats and its vertical movements were unaffected by sediment treatment, generally reaching depths between 20 and 25cm. Most individuals of species with a weaker subsurface affinity (i.e. the benthic grazer Heptagenia sulphurea and the filter-feeder Hydropsyche siltalai) became stranded as water levels were reduced in all sediment treatments. Vertical movements of Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were restricted primarily by pore volume, these taxa becoming stranded most commonly in sediments with smaller interstitial volumes. Our results highlight the need for the development and implementation of river management strategies that increase streambed porosity, allowing macroinvertebrates to access to the saturated subsurface habitat during stream drying.

TI  - Very low pressures drive ventilatory flow in chimaeroid fishes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Chimaera (Holocephali) are cartilaginous fishes with flexible operculi rather than external gill slits, suggesting ventilation occurs in a manner different from other fishes. We examined holocephalan ventilation morphology, behavior, and performance by anatomical investigations, high-speed video, and in vivo pressure measurements from the buccal and parabranchial cranial cavities in Hydrolagus colliei and Callorhinchus callorynchus. Ventilatory modes ranged from quiet resting breathing to rapid active breathing, yet external cranial movementsexcepting the passive movement of the opercular flapwere always extremely subtle, and pressures generated were one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of other fishes. To explain ventilation with such minimal pressure generation and cranial motion, we propose an accordion model, whereby rostrocaudal movement of the visceral arches drives pressure differentials, albeit with little lateral or ventral movement. Chimaeroids have comparatively large oropharyngeal cavities, which can move fluid with a smaller linear dimension change than the comparatively smaller cavities of other fishes. Orobranchial pressures are often less than parabranchial pressures, suggesting flow in the wrong direction; however, the long gill curtains of chimaeroids may passively restrict backflow. We suggest that constraints on holocephalan jaw and hyoid movements were compensated for evolutionarily by novel visceral arch mechanics and kinematics. J. Morphol., 2012.

TI  - Veränderungen des dynamischen sehens und der kontrastempfindlichkeit durch chronische alkoholabhängigkeit
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: From sensual physiological perspective, the dynamic visual acuity is characteristic of the magnocellular visual subsystem of the apparatus. The static vision is realized by the parvocellular subsystem, so that dynamic and static visual acuities to be regarded as independent qualities. According to the Federal Ministry of Health (2009) are approximately 1.3 million people in Germany as a declared alcohol. The aim of our study was to examine the dynamic vision to the influence quantity chronic alcohol dependence. Method: It was attended by 106 participants in the investigation. 35 test persons were dependent on alcohol and 71 test persons belonged to the control group. The study design consisted of the collection of sociodemographic data, the medical history and status of ophthalmologic examinations. The dynamic vision was seeing through Düsseldorf for Dynamic Test of Wist (Wist et al. 1998) determined. Results: The alcohol-dependent subjects achieved significantly worse scores in the determination of visual acuity. When considering the dynamic visual performance of subjects with alcohol dependence, this proved to both eyes decreased by 11%. In addition, both eyes were KE-reduced values in different spatial frequencies. Conclusions: Poor dynamic visual performance of subjects with alcohol dependence may be associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Further studies on the reversibility of the effects found are required. © ecomed Medizin, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH.

TI  - Vestibular Asymmetry: Some Theoretical and Practical Considerations
PY  - 1983
AB  - Pathological vestibular asymmetry can be divided into static and dynamic types. Static asymmetry results from a unilateral change of the resting neural input. Acute, chronic, and recovery stages can be recognized if one interprets the direction and intensity of the resultant spontaneous nystagmus relative to the clinical picture. Static asymmetry is additive with induced asymmetry and manifests itself as directional preponderance or as the direction-fixed or direction-changing feature of positional nystagmus. Dynamic asymmetry refers to abnormal asymmetry induced by normal head movements. For example, with unilateral hypo-function, a greater gain is observed with head movement toward the unaffected side, suggesting nonlinearity as specified by Ewald's second law. Visually induced vestibular asymmetry is a form of dynamic asymmetry generated by convergence of visual-vestibular information, and causing symptoms in certain “motion-active” visual environments.

TI  - Vestibular control of the head: possible functions of the vestibulocollic reflex
PY  - 2011
AB  - Here, we review the angular vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) focusing on its function during unexpected and voluntary head movements. Theoretically, the VCR could (1) stabilize the head in space during body movements and/or (2) dampen head oscillations that could occur as a result of the head's underdamped mechanics. The reflex appears unaffected when the simplest, trisynaptic VCR pathways are severed. The VCR's efficacy varies across species; in humans and monkeys, head stabilization is ineffective during low-frequency body movements in the yaw plan. While the appearance of head oscillations after the attenuation of semicircular canal function suggests a role in damping, this interpretation is complicated by defects in the vestibular input to other descending motor pathways such as gaze premotor circuits. Since the VCR should oppose head movements, it has been proposed that the reflex is suppressed during voluntary head motion. Consistent with this idea, vestibular-only (VO) neurons, which are possible vestibulocollic neurons, respond vigorously to passive, but not active, head rotations. Although VO neurons project to the spinal cord, their contribution to the VCR remains to be established. VCR cancelation during active head movements could be accomplished by an efference copy signal negating afferent activity related to active motion. Oscillations occurring during active motion could be eliminated by some combination of reflex actions and voluntary motor commands that take into account the head's biomechanics. A direct demonstration of the status of the VCR during active head movements is required to clarify the function of the reflex.

TI  - Vestibular function assessment using the NIH Toolbox
PY  - 2013
AB  - Objective: Development of an easy to administer, low-cost test of vestibular function.Methods: Members of the NIH Toolbox Sensory Domain Vestibular, Vision, and Motor subdomain teams collaborated to identify 2 tests: 1) Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA), and 2) the Balance Accelerometry Measure (BAM). Extensive work was completed to identify and develop appropriate software and hardware. More than 300 subjects between the ages of 3 and 85 years, with and without vestibular dysfunction, were recruited and tested. Currently accepted gold standard measures of static visual acuity, vestibular function, dynamic visual acuity, and balance were performed to determine validity. Repeat testing was performed to examine reliability.Results: The DVA and BAM tests are affordable and appropriate for use for individuals 3 through 85 years of age. The DVA had fair to good reliability (0.41-0.94) and sensitivity and specificity (50%-73%), depending on age and optotype chosen. The BAM test was moderately correlated with center of pressure (r = 0.42-0.48) and dynamic posturography (r = -0.48), depending on age and test condition. Both tests differentiated those with and without vestibular impairment and the young from the old. Each test was reliable.Conclusion: The newly created DVA test provides a valid measure of visual acuity with the head still and moving quickly. The novel BAM is a valid measure of balance. Both tests are sensitive to age-related changes and are able to screen for impairment of the vestibular system. Neurology (R) 2013; 80 (Suppl 3):S25-S31

TI  - Vestibular guidance of active head movements
PY  - 2009
AB  - Vestibular sensors provide precise and timely information about head velocity in space. It is well established that this information is used to stabilize eyes, head and body against movements from outside, i.e., passive movements. Here, we investigate whether vestibular information also helps to monitor and guide active head movements during gaze shifts. We measured head movements during large gaze shifts toward briefly flashed targets in humans with complete vestibular loss (vestibular subjects) and in healthy controls before and after increasing their head moment of inertia. Whereas normally head movements oscillate neither in vestibular subjects nor in controls, the increase in head moment of inertia caused marked head oscillations only in vestibular subjects. We conclude that vestibular information plays an important role in the on-line guidance of active head movements and helps to correct for unexpected changes such as additional torque imposed by an increase in moment of inertia.

TI  - Vestibular input to human MST but not MT
PY  - 2010
AB  - In macaques, cortical area MST receives vestibular as well as visual input. The vestibular tuning of MST neurons can be either (i) congruent with their tuning for optic flow, suggesting combination of cues to specify self-motion more accurately, or (ii) opposite, perhaps allowing head motion to be discounted in order to facilitate detection of object motion. In contrast, it is thought that macaque MT does not have vestibular afferents. We have examined whether human MT and MST have vestibular inputs by applying galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in combination with fMRI. GVS involves passing a controlled current between two electrodes attached to the mastoid processes, to stimulate the cranial nerves that connect the vestibular organs to the brainstem. We applied a 1Hz sinusoidal alternating current of ±1 mA during conventional fMRI acquisition at 3Tesla. All participants reliably experienced vestibular sensations during stimulation intervals (roll and/or yaw that alternated in direction at 1Hz). Scanning was performed in total darkness and also while continuously observing a static visual scene. In separate scans, MT and MST were identified conventionally with unilateral visual motion stimulation, exploiting the fact that MST but not MT responds to ipsilateral visual stimuli. During GVS, significant time-locked activation was seen in the MT+ complex. It occurred in darkness as well as during vision so cannot be attributed to image motion caused by cyclotorsional eye movements. In every case, it occurred only in the anterior portion of MT+ and the active region corresponded well to MST as defined visually. Activity was also seen in parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC). Suppression was often seen in occipital cortex and in somatosensory cortex, consistent with known inhibitory interactions. We conclude that human MST receives vestibular afferents but human MT does not. In addition, GVS provides an alternative localizer for MST.

TI  - Vestibular rehabilitation after stroke
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Patients with vestibular dysfunction after stroke have measurable impairment of motor control, especially during the execution of tasks that require balance, cephalic rotations and good dynamic visual acuity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vestibular rehabilitation in patients with central vestibular dysfunction after stroke. Method: We evaluated eight patients with diagnosis of ischemic stroke by means of static balance test clocking the time spent in each posture with eyes closed under foam of density 28, without the influence of sensory stimulation of the feet; and dynamic balance, such as Time up and go (TUG), Functional Reach transcutanetest and Fukuda. All tests were performed in three moments: M0 - before vestibular rehabilitation, M1 - after 3 months of vestibular rehabilitation, and M2 - after 6 months of vestibular rehabilitation. Treatment consisted of vestibular habituation exercises, sensory integration and dynamic balance, once a week, lasting 45 minutes. Data were analyzed using Student's t test and Spearman correlation with a significance level of 5%. Results: The mean age of subjects was 62.83 +/- 5.01 years and the time of injury of 4.03 +/- 1.87 months. The subjects had less time spent in all static balance tests with eyes closed and without sensory stimulus (p <0.05), but after the sixth month of treatment had a significant increase when compared with the index pre-treatment (p <0.001). A positive correlation was found between the static balance tests and functional range and a negative correlation with the TUG (p <0.001). Conclusion: Vestibular rehabilitation improves static and dynamic balance after stroke, as evident from the sixth month of treatment. (Figure presented).

TI  - Vestibular signals of posterior parietal cortex neurons during active and passive head movements in macaque monkeys
PY  - 2003
AB  - The posterior parietal cortex may function as an interface between sensory and motor cortices and thus could be involved in the formation of motor plans as well as abstract representations of space. We have recorded from neurons in the intraparietal sulcus, namely, the ventral and medial intraparietal areas (VIP and MIP, respectively), and analyzed their head-movement-related signals in relation to passive and active movements. To generate active head movements, we made the animals track a moving fixation spot in the horizontal plane under head-free conditions. When under certain circumstances the animals were tracking the fixation spot almost exclusively via head movements, a clear correlation between neuronal firing rate and head movement could be established. Furthermore, a newly employed paradigm, the "replay method," made available direct comparison of neuronal firing behavior under active and passive movement conditions. In such case, the animals were allowed to make spontaneous head movements in darkness. Subsequently, the heads were fixed and the previously recorded active head-movement profile was reproduced by a turntable as passive stimulation. Neuronal responses ranged from total extinction of the vestibular signal during active movement to presence of activity only during active movement. Furthermore, in approximately one-third of the neurons, a change of vestibular on-direction depending on active versus passive movement mode was observed, that is, type I neurons became type II neurons, etc. We suggest that the role of parietal vestibular neurons has to be sought in sensory space representation rather than reflex behavior and motor control contexts.

TI  - Vestibular-Evoked Responses Indicate a Functional Role for Intrinsic Foot Muscles During Standing Balance
PY  - 2018
AB  - Maintaining standing balance involves multisensory processing and integration to produce dynamic motor responses. Electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) delivered over the mastoid processes can be used to explore the vestibular control of balance. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intrinsic foot muscles exhibit vestibular-evoked balance responses and to characterize the traits associated with these responses. Electromyography (EMG) of the abductor hallucis (AH), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) and anterior-posterior (AP) forces were sampled while quietly standing participants were subjected to a random continuous EVS signal (peak-to-peak amplitude = +/- 3 mA). The relationship between EVS input and motor output was characterized in both the frequency (coherence) and time (cumulant density) domains. When head orientation was rotated in yaw from left to right, the biphasic cumulant density function was inverted for all muscle (EVS-EMG) and whole-body (EVS-AP forces) balance responses. When vision was occluded, the EVS-EMG and EVS-AP forces coherence function amplitude increased at low frequencies (<2 Hz) and was accompanied by a heightened medium-latency peak amplitude for all muscles as well as the whole-body balance response (AP forces) compared to when static visual cues were present. The enhanced coherence amplitudes at lower frequencies may highlight a mechanism for the increase in postural sway from vision to occluded vision. The current findings indicate that the vestibular control of standing balance can be represented by the intrinsic foot muscles and implicate a postural role for these muscles in modulating quiet standing.

TI  - Vestibulo-Ocular Responses and Dynamic Visual Acuity During Horizontal Rotation and Translation
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) provides an overall functional measure of visual stabilization performance that depends on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), but also on other processes, including catch-up saccades and likely visual motion processing. Capturing the efficiency of gaze stabilization against head movement as a whole, it is potentially valuable in the clinical context where assessment of overall patient performance provides an important indication of factors impacting patient participation and quality of life. DVA during head rotation (rDVA) has been assessed previously, but to our knowledge, DVA during horizontal translation (tDVA) has not been measured. tDVA can provide a valuable measure of how otolith, rather than canal, function impacts visual acuity. In addition, comparison of DVA during rotation and translation can shed light on whether common factors are limiting DVA performance in both cases. We therefore measured and compared DVA during both passive head rotations (head impulse test) and translations in the same set of healthy subjects (n = 7). In addition to DVA, we computed average VOR gain and retinal slip within and across subjects. We observed that during translation, VOR gain was reduced (VOR during rotation, mean +/- SD: position gain = 1.05 +/- 0.04, velocity gain = 0.97 +/- 0.07; VOR during translation, mean +/- SD: position gain = 0.21 +/- 0.08, velocity gain = 0.51 +/- 0.16), retinal slip was increased, and tDVA was worse than during rotation (average rDVA = 0.32 +/- 0.15 logMAR; average tDVA = 0.56 +/- 0.09 IogMAR, p = 0.02). This suggests that reduced VOR gain leads to worse tDVA, as expected. We conclude with speculation about non-oculomotor factors that could vary across individuals and affect performance similarly during both rotation and translation.

TI  - Vestibulo-ocular reflex during magnified vision: adaptation to reduce visual-vestibular conflict.
PY  - 1987
AB  - This report describes the short-term effect of 2.2X telescopic spectacles on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in seven volunteers. VOR gain was initially measured in darkness and light during passive sinusoidal rotations. Subjects were then rotated in light for 15 min while wearing telescopic spectacles. Dynamic visual acuity (DVA), vision during head rotation, was measured with telescopic spectacles. Initial VOR gain in darkness was 0.74 +/- 0.10 (mean +/- S.D.); VOR gain with unmagnified vision was 1.07 +/- 0.04. Initial VOR gain with magnified vision was 1.37 +/- 0.53. DVA was poorer than static acuity in three of four subjects. After adaptation, VOR gain in darkness increased to 0.83 +/- 0.12, with six of seven subjects exhibiting a gain increase of 7-23% (p less than 0.05 for 5). Adapted VOR gain with magnified vision was 1.54 +/- 0.25. Adapted performance was more consistent and oscillopsia was reduced. Adapted DVA improved 30-100% in four subjects. These changes indicate VOR adaptation to telescopic spectacles decreases visual-vestibular conflict.

TI  - Vestibulo-ocular response and balance control in children and young adults with mild-to-moderate intellectual and developmental disability: A pilot study
PY  - 2013
AB  - The vestibulo-ocular response (VOR) may not be fully developed in children with an intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). This study aimed to identify the presence of VOR deficit in children and young adults with unspecified mild-to-moderate intellectual and developmental disability and its effect on balance control. Twenty-one children and young adults with IDD ranging in age from 8 to 22 years (mean 17.5 +/- 3.9 years) were included in the study. The VOR was evaluated with the Head Impulse Test and the Static and Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (S&D-VAT). Postural stability was measured in an upright standing position by the Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance (CTSIB), single leg stance (SLS) during eyes open and eyes closed, and Romberg stance under eyes open and eyes closed conditions using a force platform. Reduced vestibulo-ocular responses were found in 13 of 21 (62%) participants who were able to complete testing. In the fifth condition of the CTSIB (standing on foam with eyes closed), those without VOR deficit were able to maintain balance longer than those with VOR deficit (29 s [median 30] vs. 12 s [median 7.3], respectively; p = 0.03). The study demonstrates potential effects of VOR deficit in children and young adults with IDD and some significant differences in balance control between those with and without a VOR deficit. VOR function in children and young adults with IDD should be routinely tested to enable early detection of deficits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vibration Control of Vehicle using Road Profile Information
PY  - 2017
AB  - In this study, based on the RPS algorithm, the application results to an electrically controlled suspension system using previewed road information are presented. Reducing the excessive vibration induced by a disturbance transmitted to the system and secure its stability is a major issue. In particular, in the automotive industry, the demand is constantly being raised. A typical external disturbance causing vibration and instability of a vehicle is an irregular roadway surface that contacts a running vehicle tire. Therefore, obtaining such profile information is an important process. The RPS algorithm using a multi sensor system was constructed and implemented in a real car. Through experimental work using the RPS system included non-contact type optical sensors, it could robustly reconstruct the road input profiles from the intermixed data onto the vehicle's dynamic motion while traveling at an uneven roadway surface. A controller with a preview control was designed in the framework of a semi-active suspension system based on the 7 degrees of freedom full vehicle model. The control performance of the system was evaluated through simulations and the results were compared with the passive vehicle condition. These results highlight the feasibility of the presented control frame.

TI  - Vibration response imaging: protocol for a systematic review.
PY  - 2013
AB  - BACKGROUND: The concept of lung sounds conveying information regarding lung physiology has been used extensively in clinical practice, particularly with physical auscultation using a stethoscope. Advances in computer technology have facilitated the construction of dynamic visual images derived from recorded lung sounds. Arguably, the most significant progress in this field was the development of the commercially available vibration response imaging (VRI) (Deep Breeze Ltd, Or-Akiva, Israel). This device provides a non-invasive, dynamic image of both lungs constructed from sounds detected from the lungs using surface sensors. In the literature, VRI has been utilized in a multitude of clinical and research settings. This systematic review aims to address three study questions relating to whether VRI can be used as an evaluative device, whether the images generated can be characterized, and which tools and measures have been used to assess these images.METHODS/DESIGN: This systematic review will involve implementing search strategies in five online journal databases in order to extract articles relating to the application of VRI. Appropriate articles will be identified against a set of pre-determined eligibility criteria and assessed for methodological quality using a standardized scale. Included articles will have data extracted by the reviewers using a standardized evidence table. A narrative synthesis based on a standardized framework will be conducted, clustering evidence into three main groups; one for each of the study questions. A meta-analysis will be conducted if two or more research articles meet pre-determined criteria that allow quantitative synthesis to take place.DISCUSSION: This systematic review aims to provide a complete overview of the scope of VRI in the clinical and research settings, as well as to discuss methods to interpret the data obtained from VRI. The systematic review intends to help clinicians to make informed decisions on the clinical applicability of the device, to allow researchers to identify further potential avenues of investigation, and to provide methods for the evaluation and interpretation of dynamic and static images. The publication and registration of this review with PROSPERO provides transparency and accountability, and facilitates the appraisal of the proposed systematic review against the original design.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42013003751.

TI  - Vibration therapy
PY  - 2009
AB  - Whole-body vibration training is a method for muscle strengthening that is increasingly used in a variety of clinical situations. Key descriptors of vibration devices include the frequency, the amplitude, and the direction of the vibration movement. In a typical vibration session, the user stands on the device in a static position or performs dynamic movements. Most authors hypothesize that vibrations stimulate muscle spindles and alpha-motoneurons, which initiate a muscle contraction. An immediate effect of a non-exhausting vibration session is an increase in muscle power. Most studies of the longer term use of vibration treatment in various disorders have pursued three therapeutic aims: increasing muscle strength, improving balance, and increasing bone mass. In a small pilot trial in children we noted improvements in standing function, lumbar spine bone mineral density, tibial bone mass, and calf muscle cross-sectional area.

TI  - Vibrations and stability of a moving band
PY  - 1968
AB  - The problem of a thin strip moving with constant speed in a longitudinal direction is formulated. The effect of a conservative point load acting parallel to the plane of the strip and normal to one of the short sides of the cross section is included in the formulation and a study is made of the lateral and torsional motions of the strip. The equations governing the dynamic motion of the strip are derived by a variational method and it is shown that the presence of the point load couples the lateral and torsional motions both in the system differential equations and in the boundary conditions. The coupled equations have variable coefficients due to the terms involving the initial state of stress arising from the presence of the point load. An exact analytical solution not being feasible, a parametric study of the lowest modes is carried out using a collocation method of solution. The effects of various system parameters on the frequency are studied and the occurrence of a static buckling load is predicted. The results of the study are compared with a previous analysis where the coupling of lateral and torsional motion was neglected. It is shown that in certain cases, the coupling effect is very important and cannot be neglected. © 1968.

TI  - Vibro-acoustic model of an active aircraft cabin window
PY  - 2017
AB  - This paper presents modeling and design of an active structural acoustic control (ASAC) system for controlling the low frequency sound field transmitted through an aircraft cabin window. The system uses stacked piezoelectric elements arranged in a manner to generate out-of-plane actuation point forces acting on the window panel boundaries. A theoretical vibro-acoustic model for an active quadruple-panel system is developed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the system and achieve a good understanding of the active control performance and the physical phenomena of the sound transmission loss (STL) characteristics. The quadruple-panel system represents the passenger window design used in some classes of modern aircraft with an exterior double pane of Plexiglas, an interior dust cover pane and a glazed dimmable pane, all separated by thin air cavities. The STL characteristics of identical pane window configurations with different piezoelectric actuator sets are analyzed. A parametric study describes the influence of important active parameters, such as the input voltage, number and location of the actuator elements, on the STL is investigated. In addition, a mathematical model for obtaining the optimal input voltage is developed to improve the acoustic attenuation capability of the control system. In general, the achieved results indicate that the proposed ASAC design offers a considerable improvement in the passive sound loss performance of cabin window design without significant effects, such as weight increase, on the original design. Also, the results show that the acoustic control of the active model with piezoelectric actuators bonded to the dust cover pane generates high structural vibrations in the radiating panel (dust cover) and an increase in sound power radiation. High active acoustic attenuation can be achieved by designing the ASAC system to apply active control forces on the inner Plexiglas panel or dimmable panel by installing the actuators on the boundaries of one of the two panels. In some cases, increasing the actuator numbers in the structure advances the active control performance by controlling more structural modes; however, this decreases the STL of the passive control system because of the increase in structure-borne sound transmission paths of the stiffer piezoelectric actuators.

TI  - Video deinterlacing with dynamic motion analysis and scene cut detection
PY  - 2012
AB  - In this paper we will propose a new deinterlacing method which uses a scene cut detection technique. The proposed method first performs scene cut detection on interlaced video sequences. If a scene cut is detected between the current field and the reference field, we suggest reducing the interpolation error caused by incorrect motion compensation. On the other hand, if no scene cut is detected, motion detection is performed on the current field. The motion detection based on block variance classifies a block of the current field into one of three groups, namely: static, semi static and non-static. Then, the modified bilateral motion estimation is performed for non-static blocks, simple bilinear interpolation is used for semi-static blocks and finally static blocks will inherit the original pixels from the reference field. In the experiments for the subjective evaluation, the proposed method has shown acceptable results in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and computation time consumption. © 2012 ACM.

AB  - In this study, we present a system for video event classification that generates a temporal pyramid of static visual semantics using minimum-value, maximum-value, and average-value aggregation techniques. Kernel optimization and model subspace boosting are then applied to customize the pyramid for each event. SVM models are independently trained for each level in the pyramid using kernel selection according to 3-fold cross-validation. Kernels that both enforce static temporal order and permit temporal alignment are evaluated. Model subspace boosting is used to select the best combination of pyramid levels and aggregation techniques for each event. The NIST TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) 2011 dataset was used for evaluation. Results demonstrate that kernel optimizations using both temporally static and dynamic kernels together achieves better performance than any one particular method alone. In addition, model sub-space boosting reduces the size of the model by 80%, while maintaining 96% of the performance gain. © 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Video fluoroscopy as a method of detecting occipitoatlantal instability in Down's syndrome for special olympics
PY  - 1994
AB  - Video fluoroscopy, which allows for the evaluation of dynamic motion during radiographic evaluation, was used to screen individuals with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) for the detection of atlantoaxial instability before participation in Special Olympic athletic events. The presence of this instability would preclude an individual from participation in certain high- risk sports, but during the screening examination, two individuals with instability at the occipitoatlantal region were detected. This instability would also preclude an individual from participation because traumatic luxation could lead to severe spinal cord injury or death. Both individuals were asymptomatic, and one had submitted a report of normal plain view flexion and extension radiographs. It is the purpose of this report to identify this structural abnormality and recommend video fluoroscopy screening for all athletes with Down's syndrome wishing to participate in Special Olympic athletic events because it appears to be more sensitive in detecting aberrant motion in the craniocervical spine than plain, static view radiographs.

TI  - Video pornography detection through deep learning techniques and motion information
PY  - 2017
AB  - Recent literature has explored automated pornographic detection a bold move to replace humans in the tedious task of moderating online content. Unfortunately, on scenes with high skin exposure, such as people sunbathing and wrestling, the state of the art can have many false alarms. This paper is based on the premise that incorporating motion information in the models can alleviate the problem of mapping skin exposure to pornographic content, and advances the bar on automated pornography detection with the use of motion information and deep learning architectures. Deep Learning, especially in the form of Convolutional Neural Networks, have striking results on computer vision, but their potential for pornography detection is yet to be fully explored through the use of motion information. We propose novel ways for combining static (picture) and dynamic (motion) information using optical flow and MPEG motion vectors. We show that both methods provide equivalent accuracies, but that MPEG motion vectors allow a more efficient implementation. The best proposed method yields a classification accuracy of 97.9% an error reduction of 64.4% when compared to the state of the art on a dataset of 800 challenging test cases. Finally, we present and discuss results on a larger, and more challenging, dataset.

TI  - Video representation with dynamic features from multi-frame frame-difference images
PY  - 2007
AB  - The extraction of dynamic motion features are reported from multiple video frames by three unsupervised learning algorithms, i.e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Since the human perception of facial motion goes through two different pathways, i.e., the lateral fusifom gyrus for the invariant aspects and the superior temporal sulcus for the changeable aspects of faces, we extracted the dynamic video features from multiple consecutive frames for the latter. Both the original videos and the frame-difference sequences are used for comparison. The required number of multiframe features for the same representation accuracy is almost independent upon the frame length. Therefore, the multiple-frame features are much more efficient for video representation than the single-frame static features. The extracted features are also used for lipreading, and the features from frame-difference sequences demonstrated better recognition rates than those from original videos. © 2007 IEEE.

TI  - View-dependent textured splatting
PY  - 2006
AB  - We present a novel approach to render low resolution point clouds with multiple high resolution textures - the type of data typical from passive vision systems. The low precision, noisy, and sometimes incomplete nature of such data sets is not suitable for existing point-based rendering techniques that are designed to work with high precision and high density point clouds. Our new algorithm - view-dependent textured splatting (VDTS) - combines traditional splatting with a view-dependent texturing strategy to reduce rendering artifacts caused by imprecision or noise in the input data.VDTS requires no pre-processing of input data, addresses texture aliasing, and most importantly, processes texture visibility on-the-fly. The combination of these characteristics makes VDTS well-suited for interactive rendering of dynamic scenes. Towards this end, we present a real-time view acquisition and rendering system to demonstrate the effectiveness of VDTS. In addition, we show that VDTS can produce high quality rendering when the texture images are augmented with per-pixel depth. In this scenario, VDTS is a reasonable alternative for interactive rendering of large CG models.

TI  - Viewpoint Evaluation for Online 3-D Active Object Classification
PY  - 2016
AB  - We present an end-to-end method for active object classification in cluttered scenes from RGB-D data. Our algorithms predict the quality of future viewpoints in the form of entropy using both class and pose. Occlusions are explicitly modeled in predicting the visible regions of objects, which modulates the corresponding discriminatory value of a given view. We implement a one-step greedy planner and demonstrate our method online using a mobile robot. We also analyze the performance of our method compared to similar strategies in simulated execution using the Willow Garage dataset. Results show that our active method usefully reduces the number of views required to accurately classify objects in clutter as compared to traditional passive perception.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the size distribution of young firms within some selected industries, trying to assess the empirical implications of different models of industry dynamics: the model of passive learning (Jovanovic 1982), the model of active learning (Ericson and Pakes, 1995), and the evolutionary model (Audretsch, 1995). We use a non-parametric technique, the Kernel density estimator, applied to a data set from the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS), consisting in 12 cohorts of new manufacturing firms followed for 6 years. Since the patterns of convergence to the limit distribution are different between industries, we conclude that the model of passive learning is consistent with some of them, the active exploration model with others, the evolutionary model with all of them.

PY  - 2004
AB  - The current requirement, which lead to the decision for rapid deployment, is for a UAV that can be used against the type of time-critical threats currently being encountered in Iraq, including groups of guerrillas setting up mortars or emplacing mines or booby traps ahead of coalition convoys. The UAV will be able to send back imagery of the threat and engage it. Viper Strike uses a semi-active laser designator with a seeker head that acquires targets illuminated by a laser target designator. This guidance replaces the passive acoustic and infrared sensors of the BAT while retaining the proven airframe. It can attack targets illuminated by a laser designator carried on the Hunter UAV. © 2005 Jane's Information Group. All rights reserved.

TI  - Virtual Reality Approach for Testing Dynamic Visual Acuity
PY  - 1920
AB  - Healthy person normally has similar static and dynamic visual acuity. They can clearly see the details of static and moving objects and so have good reflexes. However, due to aging or health problems in vestibular apparatus dynamic acuity may differ from static resulting in longer reaction span, and problematic orientation in dynamic environments. As static visual acuity test is a standard procedure, the dynamic tests are performed rarely even in such areas as when issuing driver’s license or during medical examination of recruits [1]. Standard dynamic visual acuity test is performed manually when patient is at 3 or 6 meter distance from standard optometric (e.g. Snellen) chart. The examiner stands behind patient and firmly grasps the patients head with both hands above ears. Then he moves patient’s head at a magnitude of 20 – 30 degrees with approximately 2 Hz (two cycles per second) rate in order to stimulate hypo-functional vestibular end organ to achieve inhibitory cut-off. During stimulus, patient has to recognize the lowest readable line in the optometric chart [2]. If dynamic visual acuity is worse than static in two lines or more, pathology is detected. The aim of this study was to investigate an application feasibility of head mounted virtual reality (VR) device such as Oculus Rift (Oculus VR Inc., USA) for performing static and dynamic visual acuity tests. Lately, VR devices took a significant place among gaming platforms, so it may be a great choice for computerized medical screening purposes. VR devices like Oculus Rift 2 pack wide field view 3D screen along with a set of sensors allowing to track head’s orientation and motion speed.

TI  - Virtual Reality Efficacy During Zero Gravity Arm Training in Post Stroke
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Successful upper limb rehabilitation after stroke occurs only in 20% of cases. It is known post stroke paresis leads to physiological movement pattern become impossible or poor energy‐efficient, resulting in formation of abnormal muscle synergies. The successful recovery of movements requires task‐oriented training provided in close to real environment, active patient's participation, interactive feedback, allowing the patient to control the correct execution of motor tasks and adapt their own efforts to correct pathological synergies in hand. Materials and Methods: 24 patients who met the inclusion criteria (12 males and 12 females) were included. The median age was 52 years (38; 61), with a median of 9.5 months before stroke (3; 23). Patients were randomized into two groups: main group (n = 17) and the control group (n = 7). The groups were comparable in terms of age, time elapsed after stroke and the degree of neurological deficit (Fugl‐Meyer scale, MRCW scale, Modified Ashworth scale, ARAT scores). Patients from the main group were trained using exoskeleton system with arm weight unloading (Armeo Spring) and 3D virtual reality feedback. Unloading weight was set according to the weight of the patient's arm, so the arms were in relaxed position with 45° of flexion in the shoulder joint and forearm in a horizontal position. All trainings were conducted with all degrees of freedom in upper limb. This condition is necessary for a learning patient to actively prevent the pathological synergistic pattern during task‐oriented training. The control group received course of conventional kinesiotherapy reaching and grasping trainings with use of weight unloading technology and visual movement control. Both groups received 10 sessions of 45‐minute training. Results: Significant changes (p < 0.05) were found in the Fugl‐ Meyer scale assessments: an increase of active movements in the arm, in the wrist and hand, the range of passive movements, the deep sensitivity improvement, and total arm functionality score. Significant ARAT scale improvement: cylindrical grip, pinch grip and the total score. Also, the main group showed significant improvement in movements out of synergy, measured using Fugl‐Meyer scale. In the control group, statistically significant improvement was observed only in passive movement increasing (Fugl‐Meyer scale). Discussion: The use of combined virtual reality and weight support method for arm motor training is a more effective way to restore the impaired motor function in patients after cerebrovascular accident than conventional therapy. This approach contributes to the reorganization of the motor pattern through biomechanical and visual feedback, projected into the virtual space. The use of such techniques can significantly intensify the rehabilitation process and improve movement pattern by decreasing pathological synergies.

TI  - Virtual Reality and Outpatient Hysteroscopy
PY  - 2018
AB  - INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND Performing procedures for investigation and treatment of gynaecological conditions in the office setting is becoming commonplace. Outpatient gynaecological procedures can reduce risks of general anaesthetic, decrease health care costs and make the procedure more convenient for the patient and provider. However, ensuring adequate pain relief and allaying anxiety during the procedure can prove to be challenging. Appropriate patient selection, counselling and adequate pain management during the procedure can improve patient experience and reduce the number of failed procedures. Common office gynaecological procedures include outpatient hysteroscopy, colposcopy and large loop excision of transformation zone, manual vacuum aspiration for treatment of miscarriages, intrauterine contraceptive device insertion, hysteroscopic sterilisation and endometrial biopsy. Pain in gynaecological procedures can originate from the cervix and uterus. The uterine fundus is innervated by sympathetic fibres from T10 to L2, which enter through the uterosacral ligaments via the inferior hypogastric plexus, and by nerves from the ovarian plexuses at the cornua. Parasympathetic fibres from S2 to S4 travel through the broad ligament to enter the cervix at the 3 0 clock and 9 o clock positions to provide innervation to the upper vagina, cervix and the lower uterine segment. The pudendal nerve (S 2,3, 4) supplies the lower vagina and vulva. Physical, psychological and social factors influence the intensity of pain experienced. Counselling the patients pre procedurally helps to better manage expectations and pain. Outpatient hysteroscopy is usually performed for patients having abnormal uterine bleeding and subfertility. Pain levels during this procedure can be influenced by the diameter of the hysteroscope. Mini hysteroscopes with an outer diameter of 3.5 mm have been associated with lower pain scores. Additional procedures performed (like polypectomy or Coil insertions) could increase the duration of the procedure and the pain experienced during the procedure. Pain scores in the vaginoscopic approach have been noted to be 3.8 when compared to 5.3 in the traditional group, which uses a speculum and tenaculum. Pain in hysteroscopy is significantly related to the presence of cervical synechiae, to the duration of the procedure, and to the use of normal saline; conversely, parity seems to have a protective role. Previous vaginal deliveries, experience of the operator and quicker operative time are known to be associated with successful outcomes of the outpatient procedures. However, nulliparity, postmenopausal status, anxiety and anticipated pain and a history of dsymenorrhoea are known to be associated with higher perception of pain and reduced success rates. The type of pain relief offered can include various levels of sedation, local anaesthetic, analgesics and verbal support techniques through distraction by conversation, gentle language, music, guided imagery and positive suggestion. A Cochrane Review showed no consistent good quality evidence of a significant difference in safety or effectiveness between different types of pain relief compared with each other or with placebo/ no treatment. There is no consensus on the choice of analgesia for outpatient hysteroscopy and rescue analgesia in the form of intracervical blocks is often used. In the United Kingdom, most units offer analgesics either as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen or oral opiods. NSAIDS such as ibuprofen decrease uterine activity and pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and thereby reduce circulating prostaglandins. They reduce pain levels especially postoperatively. Acetaminophen also inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, but its action is in the central nervous system rather in the periphery. Hence is inferior to NSAIDS but is offered to women who cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Oral opiods act by interacting with endogenous opioid mu receptors. The only pharmacological method that has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing pain during and 30 minutes after hysteroscopy in several meta‐analysis and reviews is paracervical block. However, it fails to anaesthetise the uterus for intrauterine procedures and a previous Cochrane review was unable to confirm this. The administration of the local anaesthetic itself may be uncomfortable, have side effects due to toxicity, may cancel the beneficial effect of performing a vaginoscopic hysteroscopy and does not anaesthetise the uterus. Addition of soda bicarbonate as a buffering agent to the local anaesthetic and using dental syringes with a 27‐gauge needle has been seen to decrease the pain during the injection. Topical local anaesthetics on the cervix in the form of gel or sprays have not been shown to be effective. Women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy experience significant levels of preoperative anxiety which is higher than patients attending the gynaecology clinic and comparable to those experienced before major surgery under general anaesthesia. Anxiolytics help reduce anxiety, however they do not have a direct analgesic effect. Units often employ a trained person to engage with the patient to provide emotional support during the procedure. Distraction Techniques Type of distraction techniques range from active distraction techniques to passive techniques. Active distraction included interactive toys, virtual reality, guided imagery and relaxation and controlled breathing. Passive distraction techniques included auditory distraction in the form of music and audio‐visual distraction through watching television. Intraoperative pain and anxiety rating have been noted to be lower by use of simple intraoperative distraction techniques e.g. interacting with nurses, watching Digital Video Discs or using stress balls. There has been limited research done on the role of distraction techniques in pain management in outpatient gynaecological procedures. Music has been used as a complementary method to control anxiety and reduce perception of pain by relaxing the patient and causing less discomfort during outpatient hysteroscopy. . However, a RCT showed no positive effect of music on patients' level of pain, anxiety or satisfaction of patient or doctor for office hysteroscopy and colposcopy. Watching the procedure on the screen at office hysteroscopy has not been shown to reduce pain scores. Women with high level of preprocedural state‐ trait anxiety are more likely to perceive higher levels of pain and discomfort during colposcopy. Simple passive visual distraction during colposcopic examination was associated with a reduction in pain scores, however anxiety levels were unchanged. A Cochrane review in 2007 concluded that anxiety appears to be reduced by playing music during colposcopy. Although information leaflets did not reduce anxiety levels, they did increase knowledge levels and helped with consenting for the procedure. Virtual reality is a relatively new intervention, which has been studied as a non‐pharmacological method for pain relief. VR as a form of managing pain has been studied in paediatrics, dentistry, burns treatment, treatment of chronic pain. It has not been studied in the management of pain of gynaecological procedures, which are increasingly being performed as office procedures. It acts as a method of distraction for pain relief by changing the activity of the body's pain modulation system. This multisensory technology gives an immersive and engaging experience and serves as a distraction technique. Head tracking systems, visually stimulating scenery and audio and tactile feedback enable integration of many sensory experiences. Different psychological factors influence the effectiveness of the analgesic effect of VR. While sense of presence influence the effectiveness of VR as a distraction tool, anxiety as well as positive emotions directly affects the experience of pain. VR distraction has been associated with significant increases in pain threshold and pain tolerance and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain, and self‐reported anxiety, relative to baseline. Repeated exposure did not appear to affect the benefits of VR. Simultaneous exposure to VR and supplementary sound increases pain tolerance. Pain management in ambulatory procedures should be multimodal and should include both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. Giving the patient a range of options will increase the number of successful procedures in the outpatient setting and improve patient experience. RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY To study the role of distraction techniques for management of acute pain in ambulatory gynaecology procedures and to assess feasibility of using Virtual Reality for managing pain. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW‐UP The study will aim to recruit 40 patients and randomise them via computer generated random number allocation to either the VR intervention group or those having treatment as per routine protocol. Both groups of patients will fill a pre and post procedural questionnaire. Pain and anxiety scores prior to the procedure and after the procedure will be compared against a control group of 20 patients for pain management by standard protocol. Scores will be measured by a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) which is a validated measure of pain which is easy to use, has high compliance rates and is detects meaningful changes in pain. The NRS is an 11‐point scale consisting of integers from 0 through 10; 0 representing ''No pain'' and 10 representing ''worst imaginable pain.'' Respondents select the single number that best represents their pain intensity. Ratings of pre‐operative anxiety were measured by an 11‐point numeric rating scale: 'How would you rate any anxiety you may currently be feeling' 0 (no anxiety) and 10 (worst anxiety imaginable). The VR intervention will involve watching a standard content of the video on a mobile device using a VR hea

TI  - Virtual Swimming - Breaststroke Body Movements Facilitate Vection
PY  - 2013
AB  - Visually induced illusory self-motion (vection) was facilitated by active breaststroke arm and body movements. Optic flow was generated by having the standing observer make these arm movements, which were detected by Kinect and incorporated into the display. When generated, this optic flow was either expanding (i.e. congruent with the observer's head motion) or contracting (i.e. incongruent with his/her head motion). Optic flow generated during these active movement conditions was also later played back to the observer during passive viewing conditions. On each of these trials, we recorded vection strength (latency, duration and magnitude). We found that: (i) both congruent and incongruent breaststroke movements increased vection (i.e. compared to passive viewing conditions); and (ii) congruent breaststroke movements increased vection more than incongruent ones. We name the enhancement provided by this type of active movement 'virtual swimming'. This demonstration shows that even unusual body movements can function as a self-motion signal.

TI  - Virtual and Physical Surface Modifications as Means for Flow Control
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper reviews recent work on several flow control actuators, as well as a new hybrid actuator, and their interaction with a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The focus is on 1)a finite-span synthetic jet, where the effects of the jet orifice aspect ratio and its skew and pitch angles relative to the flow are presented; 2) a finite-span low-aspect-ratio static or dynamic pin (with similar height to the local boundary layer), where the effect of the pin's aspect ratio is discussed; and 3) a hybrid actuator, which incorporates the previous two actuators. First, the formation and evolution of flow structures associated with a synthetic jet issued into a laminar boundary layer, where the effect of the orifice's aspect ratio, as well as its pitch and skew angles, are explored. Next, the effects of the pin's aspect ratio and its dynamic motion are shown. Finally, the interaction of the hybrid actuator with the flow has shown that the combined effects of the synthetic jet and the pin resulted in alteration of the vortical structures with minimal penalty. This suggests that the hybrid actuator might be efficient for controlling different types of flowfields. An example of controlling separation over a flapped airfoil was also included, where an array of passive cylindrical pins yielded delayed or complete mitigation of separation. This was mostly due to the introduction of streamwise vortices, which redirected the flow toward the surface and energized the boundary layer. Moreover, the effect of a single dynamic pin on flow separation was larger than that of a single static pin.

TI  - Virtual integration environment as an advanced prosthetic limb training platform
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Despite advances in prosthetic development and neurorehabilitation, individuals with upper extremity (UE) loss continue to face functional and psychosocial challenges following amputation. Recent advanced myoelectric prostheses offer intuitive control over multiple, simultaneous degrees of motion and promise sensory feedback integration, but require complex training to effectively manipulate. We explored whether a virtual reality simulator could be used to teach dexterous prosthetic control paradigms to individuals with UE loss. Methods: Thirteen active-duty military personnel with UE loss (14 limbs) completed twenty, 30-min passive motor training sessions over 1-2 months. Participants were asked to follow the motions of a virtual avatar using residual and phantom limbs, and electrical activity from the residual limb was recorded using surface electromyography. Eight participants (nine limbs), also completed twenty, 30-min active motor training sessions. Participants controlled a virtual avatar through three motion sets of increasing complexity (Basic, Advanced, and Digit) and were scored on how accurately they performed requested motions. Score trajectory was assessed as a function of time using longitudinal mixed effects linear regression. Results: Mean classification accuracy for passive motor training was 43.8 ± 10.7% (14 limbs, 277 passive sessions). In active motor sessions, >95% classification accuracy (which we used as the threshold for prosthetic acceptance) was achieved by all participants for Basic sets and by 50% of participants in Advanced and Digit sets. Significant improvement in active motor scores over time was observed in Basic and Advanced sets (per additional session: β-coefficient 0.125, p = 0.022; β-coefficient 0.45, p = 0.001, respectively), and trended toward significance for Digit sets (β-coefficient 0.594, p = 0.077). Conclusions: These results offer robust evidence that a virtual reality training platform can be used to quickly and efficiently train individuals with UE loss to operate advanced prosthetic control paradigms. Participants can be trained to generate muscle contraction patterns in residual limbs that are interpreted with high accuracy by computer software as distinct active motion commands.

TI  - Virtual reality as a tool for assessing episodic memory
PY  - 2008
AB  - The principal attraction of virtual reality is its potential to create experiments close to daily life with perfect experimental control. We performed an experiment in a virtual town in order to develop a better episodic memory assessment. We tested all components of episodic memory. Young and elderly adults participated in the virtual test: they were either in an active exploration or in a passive exploration of the town. The results showed that older persons recalled the spatiotemporal context and the details of the events in a lower proportion compared to younger ones regardless of the active or passive condition. But no difference was found between active and passive exploration in measures of episodic memory. Finally, correlations mainly appeared between memory complaint and virtual scores, but not with a classical verbal episodic memory test. The virtual test seems to allow a better assessment of episodic memory compared to classical studies, especially because of its components of spatiotemporal memory assessment. In conclusion, virtual reality appears to offer the possibility of developing neuropsychological tools closer to the daily life of patients. Copyright 2008 ACM.

TI  - Virtual reality efficacy during zero gravity arm training in post-stroke patients
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Successful upper limb rehabilitation after stroke occurs only in 20% of cases. It is known post stroke paresis leads to physiological movement pattern become impossible or poor energy-efficient, resulting in formation of abnormal muscle synergies. The successful recovery of movements requires task-oriented training provided in close to real environment, active patient's participation, interactive feedback, allowing the patient to control the correct execution of motor tasks and adapt their own efforts to correct pathological synergies in hand. Materials and Methods: 24 patients who met the inclusion criteria (12 males and 12 females) were included. The median age was 52 years (38; 61), with a median of 9.5 months before stroke (3; 23). Patients were randomized into two groups: main group (n = 17) and the control group (n = 7). The groups were comparable in terms of age, time elapsed after stroke and the degree of neurological deficit (Fugl-Meyer scale, MRCW scale, Modified Ashworth scale, ARAT scores). Patients from the main group were trained using exoskeleton system with arm weight unloading (Armeo Spring) and 3D virtual reality feedback. Unloading weight was set according to the weight of the patient's arm, so the arms were in relaxed position with 45degree of flexion in the shoulder joint and forearm in a horizontal position. All trainings were conducted with all degrees of freedom in upper limb. This condition is necessary for a learning patient to actively prevent the pathological synergistic pattern during task-oriented training. The control group received course of conventional kinesiotherapy reaching and grasping trainings with use of weight unloading technology and visual movement control. Both groups received 10 sessions of 45-minute training. Results: Significant changes (p < 0.05) were found in the Fugl- Meyer scale assessments: an increase of active movements in the arm, in the wrist and hand, the range of passive movements, the deep sensitivity improvement, and total arm functionality score. Significant ARAT scale improvement: cylindrical grip, pinch grip and the total score. Also, the main group showed significant improvement in movements out of synergy, measured using Fugl-Meyer scale. In the control group, statistically significant improvement was observed only in passive movement increasing (Fugl-Meyer scale). Discussion: The use of combined virtual reality and weight support method for arm motor training is a more effective way to restore the impaired motor function in patients after cerebrovascular accident than conventional therapy. This approach contributes to the reorganization of the motor pattern through biomechanical and visual feedback, projected into the virtual space. The use of such techniques can significantly intensify the rehabilitation process and improve movement pattern by decreasing pathological synergies.

TI  - Viscous dewetting of metastable liquid films on substrates with microgrooves
PY  - 2018
AB  - We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of dewetting on substrates with parallel microgrooves. A thin, static liquid film has an equilibrium thickness so as to minimize the sum of the surface free energy and the gravitational potential energy. When the thickness of a liquid film is less than the equilibrium thickness, the film seeks the equilibrium through contraction of the wetted area, which is referred to as dewetting. We experimentally observed the dewetting of thin, metastable liquid films on substrates with parallel microgrooves. The experiments revealed that the films retract in the direction along the grooves and leaves liquid residues with various morphologies. We classify the residue morphologies into three modes and elucidate the dependence of the mode selection on the groove geometry and the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid. We also experimentally examined the dynamic motion of the receding contact lines of the dewetting films, and developed a mechanical model for the receding speed. Our results provide a basis for controlling liquid films using microstructures, which is useful for lubricant-impregnated surface production, painting, spray cooling, and surface cleaning.

TI  - Vision and Driving: A Report on Research
PY  - 1971
AB  - Information on vision test performance and personal and driving habits was obtained for 17,769 California drivers and was compared with their driving records, i.e., accidents and convictions for traffic citations. Of the vision tests evaluated, dynamic visual acuity is by far the one most closely related to driving record, followed by static visual acuity, visual field, and “night vision.” The results show that mileage, age, and sex are also important factors influencing driving record, and that conviction experience is a much more stable driving record variable than accident experience. © 1971, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

TI  - Vision and action in the language-ready brain: From mirror neurons to SemRep
PY  - 2007
AB  - The general setting for our work is to locate language perception and production within the broader context of brain mechanisms for action and perception in general, modeling brain function in terms of the competition and cooperation of schemas. Particular emphasis is placed on mirror neurons - neurons active both for execution of a certain class of actions and for recognition of a (possibly broader) class of similar actions. We build on the early VISIONS model of schema-based computer analysis of static scenes to present SemRep, a graphical representation of dynamic visual scenes designed to support the generation of varied descriptions of episodes. Mechanisms for parsing and production of sentences are currently being implemented within Template Construction Grammar (TCG), a new form of construction grammar distinguished by its use of SemRep to express semantics.

TI  - Vision and cognition in Alzheimer's disease
PY  - 2000
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to affect visual pathways, but potential concomitant effects on vision and cognitive performance are not well understood. We studied 43 individuals with AD of mild severity and 22 individuals without dementia on a battery of tests designed to measure multiple aspects of basic and higher-order visual perception and cognition. All subjects performed on the same visual and cognitive test batteries. The results showed no differences between groups on tests of static visual acuity, stereoacuity, dynamic visual acuity or motion direction discrimination. However, individuals with AD performed significantly worse on tests of static spatial contrast sensitivity, visual attention, shape-from-motion, color, visuospatial construction and Visual memory. Correlation analyses showed strong relationships between visual and cognitive scores. The findings show that AD affects several aspects of vision and are compatible with the hypothesis that visual dysfunction in AD may contribute to performance decrements in other cognitive domains. The pattern of involvement indicates that AD affects multiple visual neural pathways and regions. It is possible that better understanding of vision-related dysfunction could aid diagnosis and interventions to improve functional capacity in patients with dementia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This chapter addresses components, sensors, software, and visual cues that are important to fulfill the needs of robotic activities on the surface of planets, asteroids, comets and moons. The main users of robotic vision solutions are planetary rovers, landers and astronauts. The chapter shows that various passive vision sensor technologies have been successfully implemented in more than a dozen robotic planetary missions, while active vision such as laser ranging has not been emphasized but is envisaged a growing field for specific application and environment such as lunar poles. It also sheds some light on robotic use cases envisaged in the future that will be served by vision, such as science autonomy, soil characterization for locomotion monitoring and planning, search for a deposited sample cache, or the monitoring of robotic service and construction tasks. New techniques and use cases such as vision supported by saliency models, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics vision are underway.

TI  - Vision rules
PY  - 2000
AB  - The reviewer identifies the book's (see record 1999-02122-000) premise as, vision is not merely a matter of passive perception, but an intelligent process of active construction. The author also clearly specifies the various readerships he has in mind. For example, for those in marketing, advertising, and graphic design, he suggests that, "visual intelligence is your path to the head and heart of a consumer" (p. xiii), whereas for the reader of popular science, the book will explain "why you can buy a chess machine that beats a Master, but you can't buy a vision machine that beats a toddler's vision" (p. xiii). Interestingly, the chapter called "Inflating an Artist's Sketch", uses just two computational rules to explain several interesting perceptual phenomena that relate to how we come to see a three-dimensional (3D) world using our two-dimensional (2D) retinae. Overall, the reviewer found the book to be well written, well illustrated, and highly motivating; even though it lacks some desired elements such as a discussion of the effects of attention on visual processes. The review also points out that not everyone will agree with the framework of the presentation. For example, a Gibsonian might find the emphasis on constructivism hard to take. But the reviewer believes that most perceptionists will find the book's point of view reasonable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Vision, proprioception and corollary discharge in a movement recall test
PY  - 1978
AB  - Movement recall was investigated in relation to the sensory processes involved in a triangle drawing task. Forty subjects in two groups, one with and one without visual feedback, performed a recall task involving movements of their index finger. All subjects attended different experimental sessions in which (1) all proprioceptive feedback was eliminated by the ischaemic block technique, (2) muscle spindle feedback was distorted by vibration of the muscles and tendons involved in the movement, and (3) proprioceptive feedback was normal. Within each session subjects were required firstly to recall triangular movements made for them passively by the experimenter, and secondly, to recall movements they had made actively. Results indicated comparable accuracy in recall of active movements in all conditions, and a decrement in passive recall dependent on the availability of the alternative sources of feedback. The results indicated a process of integrated contribution of all inputs to the perception of movement; redundancy in information when all channels are available; and a role of corollary discharge in recall of movements. © 1978.

TI  - Vision-based deviation extraction for three-dimensional control in robotic welding with steel sheet
PY  - 2018
AB  - Effective multidirectional extraction of the deviations between the welding torch and the tracking point is prerequisite for three-dimensional control in robotic automatic welding. This paper presents a vision-based method to determine the logical tracking point and further to extract the deviations of the welding torch in two directions for robotic pulse metal active gas welding with steel sheet in real time. Images from passive vision sensors include two edges of the groove, the joint line, and complete arc. A scheme is proposed to accurately discern the joint line based on the local grayscale maximum within the region of interest using orientation feature maps. The geometric center of complete arc is used to reflect the position of the welding torch, and the intersection of the extracted joint line and the line that passes through the geometric center and is vertical to the former is regarded as the desired tracking point. It is transformed to the three-dimensional world coordinate via vision calibration techniques, and the deviations in two directions are yielded when contrasted with the real-time, recorded coordinate of the welding torch from the robot control system. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Visual Contrast Sensitivity in Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease
PY  - 2016
AB  - PURPOSE. Visual impairments are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and impact normal functioning in daily activities. Visual contrast sensitivity is a powerful nonmotor sign for discriminating PD patients from controls. However, it is usually assessed with static visual stimuli. Here we examined the interaction between perception and eye movements in static and dynamic contrast sensitivity tasks in a cohort of mildly impaired, early-stage PD patients.METHODS. Patients (n = 13) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12) viewed stimuli of various spatial frequencies (0-8 cyc/deg) and speeds (0 degrees/s, 10 degrees/s, 30 degrees/s) on a computer monitor. Detection thresholds were determined by asking participants to adjust luminance contrast until they could just barely see the stimulus. Eye position was recorded with a video-based eye tracker.RESULTS. Patients' static contrast sensitivity was impaired in the intermediate spatial-frequency range and this impairment correlated with fixational instability. However, dynamic contrast sensitivity and patients' smooth pursuit were relatively normal. An independent component analysis revealed contrast sensitivity profiles differentiating patients and controls.CONCLUSIONS. Our study simultaneously assesses perceptual contrast sensitivity and eye movements in PD, revealing a possible link between fixational instability and perceptual deficits. Spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity profiles may represent an easily measurable metric as a component of a broader combined biometric for nonmotor features observed in PD.

TI  - Visual Cues for Vehicle Control
PY  - 1993
AB  - Since Gibson's pioneering work in the 1950s, there has been increasing interest in describing the dynamic visual cues operators extract from the “out-the-window” scene to utilize in vehicular control. Despite this interest, we are still a long way from an adequate understanding of what optical information is utilized, and how the information is integrated into an active control strategy. There are a number of reasons for this apparent shortfalling. First, it is difficult to isolate a candidate optical cue; geometry dictates that several candidate cues will co-vary in any natural scene (e.g., edge rate and flow rate). The experimental isolation of an optical cue often results in visual scenes which are quite unnatural, creating the possibility that strategies used in the experimental setting will not generalize to operational settings. Also, much of the laboratory work has focused on demonstrating people's sensitivity to optical variables, utilizing passive verbal judgments rather than active control paradigms. Whereas the demonstration of sensitivity to an optical cue is a logically necessary step, such a demonstration is not sufficient to verify its utility in an active control task. Further, there is the need for an adequate description of the task demands, allowing a proper mapping between what the controller is trying to achieve and the information available to accomplish the task; no single cue (or set of cues) will be appropriate for all vehicular control tasks. Finally, given the robust and opportunistic nature of the human perceptual system, it is possible that the visual cues used for vehicle control will vary from individual to individual, or even within an individual depending on which cues are available and salient in the control environment. The participants in this panel are well versed in the challenges of studying visually based vehicular control. Their presentations will reflect the lessons learned in this field, as well as insights regarding how current and future research can better realize the promise of this domain.

TI  - Visual Outcome of Carotid Endarterectomy in Patients with Carotid Artery Stenosis
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is deemed to restore the blood flow of the carotid and ophthalmic arteries in patients with carotid artery stenosis. However, specific changes in visual function before and after CEA are not well understood; hence, this observational study aimed to investigate the functional and structural changes in vision after CEA in those patients.Methods: Patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (> 70% with standard carotid duplex scanning or arteriography) scheduled to undergo CEA were consecutively recruited for the study between September 2015 and July 2016. All patients underwent a standardized ophthalmic examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, slit-lamp examination, and fundus examination. Visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and kinetic and static visual fields (VFs) were tested to evaluate subjective visual function. Flash and pattern visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and an electroretinogram (ERG) were measured for objective visual function. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was scanned using optical coherence tomography for structural evaluation.Results: The study involved 15 patients (11 male and 4 female, corresponding to 30 eyes; mean age 62.8 +/- 5.0 years). After CEA, both uncorrected visual acuity and BCVA improved, and IOP significantly decreased from 17.41 +/- 2.59 to 15.95 +/- 2.50 mm Hg (P = 0.0022). Kinetic VF range increased significantly (P = 0.0126) as did mean sensitivity from 18.8 +/- 5.5 to 20.6 +/- 4.3 dB (P = 0.0208), whereas mean defect decreased from 8.2 +/- 5.3 to 6.5 +/- 4.2 dB (P = 0.025). RNFL thickness was not significantly altered. Latency of the P2 wave on flash VEP reduced significantly after CEA (P = 0.0151), whereas the oscillatory potential amplitude of waveform 3 in the ERG significantly increased after CEA.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that an improvement in carotid artery and ophthalmic artery blood flow after CEA does indeed enhance subjective and objective assessments of visual function in patients with carotid artery stenosis, including visual acuity, kinetic and static VF, P2 latency, and ocular pressure amplitude; however, it did not affect RNFL thickness.

TI  - Visual Representation in GENESIS as a tool for Physical Modeling , Sound Synthesis and Musical Composition
PY  - 2015
AB  - ABSTRACT The motivation of this paper is to highlight the importance of visual representations for artists when modeling and simulating mass- interaction physical networks in the context of sound synthesis and musical composition. GENESIS is a musician-oriented software environment for sound synthesis and musical composition. However, despite this orientation, a substantial amount of effort has been put into building a rich variety of tools based on static or dynamic visual representations of models and of abstractions of their properties. After a quick survey of these tools, we will illustrate the significant role they play in the creative process involved when going from a musical idea and exploration to the production of a complete musical piece. To that aim, our analysis will rely on the work and practice of several artists having used GENESIS in various ways.

TI  - Visual Search Performance With 3-D Auditory Cues: Effects of Motion, Target Location, and Practice
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objectives: We evaluate visual search performance in both static (nonmoving) and dynamic (moving) search environments with and without spatial (3-D) auditory cues to target location. Additionally, the effects of target trajectory, target location, and practice are assessed. Background: Previous research on aurally aided visual search has shown a significant reduction in response times when 3-D auditory cues are displayed, relative to unaided search. However, the vast majority of this research has examined only searches for static targets in static visual environments. The present experiment was conducted to examine the effect of dynamic stimuli upon aurally aided visual search performance. Method: The 8 participants conducted repeated searches for a single visual target hidden among 15 distracting stimuli. The four main conditions of the experiment consisted of the four possible combinations of 3-D auditory cues (present or absent) and search environment (static or dynamic). Results: The auditory cues were comparably effective at reducing search times in dynamic environments (-25%) as in static environments (-22%). Audio cues helped all participants. The cues were most beneficial when the target appeared at large eccentricities and on the horizontal plane. After a brief initial exposure to 3-D audio, no training or practice effects with 3-D audio were found. Conclusion: We conclude that 3-D audio is as beneficial in environments comprising moving stimuli as in those comprising static stimuli. Application: Operators in dynamic environments, such as aircraft cockpits, ground vehicles, and command-and-control centers, could benefit greatly from 3-D auditory technology when searching their environments for visual targets or other time-critical information.

TI  - Visual Strategizing The Systematic Use of Visualization in the Strategy Process by
PY  - 2006
AB  - In this article, we examine the use of visual representations for the business strategy process (from strategic analysis and strategy development to strategic planning and implementation). Starting with a review of literature, we show that visualization can address many of the cognitive, social, and emotional challenges of the strategy process, if visualization is understood as a participatory process and as interactive communication rather than as a static graphic rendering of outcomes. We categorise and position feasible methods that are based on the inter-active visual representation of information along the strategy process and highlight their benefits. A conceptual framework and six corporate case studies illustrate how to use strategy visualization systematically. In the con-clusion of the article we highlight the potential risks of visualization for strategizing and articulate a research agenda for this emergent domain.

TI  - Visual acuity in young elite motorsport athletes: A preliminary report
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objectives: To determine whether elite motorsport athletes demonstrate superior levels of Visual Acuity than age and sex-matched controls.Design: A cross-sectional observational study.Setting: A University vision and balance laboratory.Participants: Young male motorsport athletes from the New Zealand Elite Motorsport Academy and healthy age and sex-matched controls.Main outcome measures: Vision performance tests comprising: Static Visual Acuity (SVA), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA), Gaze Stabilization Test (GST), and the Perception Time Test (PTT).Results: Motorsport athletes demonstrated superior visual acuity compared to age and sex-matched controls for all measures, and while this was not statistically significant for SVA, GST and DVA, it reached statistical significance for the PTT (p <= 0.05).Conclusions: This preliminary investigation into the visual ability of motorsport athletes demonstrated that they may have superior visual performance when compared to controls. Increased visual acuity and perception time may not only act to increase performance, but may also reduce the risk of potential injury. This study highlights the need for further research into the area of visual performance, particularly in motorsport and other high-speed sports, where such skills might be integral to performance and injury reduction.

TI  - Visual and haptic influence on perception of stimulus size
PY  - 2010
AB  - In six experiments, subjects judged the sizes of squares that were presented visually and/or haptically, in uni-modal or bimodal conditions. We were interested in which mode most affected size judgments in the bimodal condition when the squares presented to each mode actually differed in size. Three factors varied: whether haptic exploration was passive or active, whether the choice set from which the subjects selected their responses was visual or haptic, and whether cutaneous information was provided in addition to kinesthetic information. To match the task for each mode, visual presentations consisted of a cursor that moved along a square pathway to correspond to the haptic experience of successive segments revealed during exploration. We found that the visual influence on size judgments was greater than the influence of haptics when the haptic experience involved only kinesthesis, passive movement, and a visual choice set. However, when cutaneous input was added to kinesthetic information, size judgments were most influenced by the haptic mode. The results support hypotheses of sensory integration, rather than capture of one sense by the other.

TI  - Visual and haptic perceptual spaces show high similarity in humans
PY  - 2010
AB  - In this study, we show that humans form highly similar perceptual spaces when they explore complex objects from a parametrically defined object space in the visual and haptic domains. For this, a three-dimensional parameter space of well-defined, shell-like objects was generated. Participants either explored two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional, interactive virtual models of these objects visually, or they explored three-dimensional plastic models haptically. In all cases, the task was to rate the similarity between two objects. Using these similarity ratings and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses, the perceptual spaces of the different modalities were then analyzed. Looking at planar configurations within this three-dimensional object space, we found that active visual exploration led to a highly similar perceptual space compared to passive exploration, showing that participants were able to reconstruct the complex parameter space already from two-dimensional pictures alone. Furthermore, we found that visual and haptic perceptual spaces had virtually identical topology compared to that of the physical stimulus space. Surprisingly, the haptic modality even slightly exceeded the visual modality in recovering the topology of the complex object space when the whole three-dimensional space was explored. Our findings point to a close connection between visual and haptic object representations and demonstrate the great degree of fidelity with which haptic shape processing occurs.

TI  - Visual and ocular control anomalies in relation to reading difficulty
PY  - 1980
AB  - Examined visual behavior under both static and dynamic viewing conditions in 40 13-yr-olds classified as successful or poor readers. Ss were videorecorded reading aloud without sound, were assessed for letter chart visual acuity, and examined on the full range of tests on a standard vision screener. The range of fusion that could be obtained before binocular vision broke down was assessed using polarized vectographs. Each S was asked whether vision tended to become double when reading. Dynamic visual behavior, ocular control, and associated postural compensation and muscular stress were investigated. It was found that poor readers indicated a significant relationship between anomalies of dynamic binocular viewing and their reading attainment. On the tests under static viewing only 1 significant difference—poor stereopsis—could be found between the 2 groups. Results support the importance of problems of dynamic binocular vision and control while reading. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Visual and passive acoustic marine mammal observations and high-frenquency seismic source characteristics recorded during a seismic survey
PY  - 2007
AB  - In this paper, we present marine mammal observation statistics, high-frequency seismic source characteristics, and example denoising of marine mammal acoustical recordings using data collected during the mitigation and monitoring program for a 3-D seismic survey by EnCana Corporation, Calgary, AB, Canada, in the Northwest Atlantic during 2003. Marine mammals were observed both visually and acoustically. No marine mammal incidents or adverse reactions were observed during the survey. Acoustical observations were made by the Seamap Passive Acoustic Cetacean Monitoring System (SPACMS), consisting of two hydrophones placed 50 m apart, towed ahead of and to one side of the seismic source. Visual and acoustical detections were uncorrelated, indicating the complementary nature of the two observational techniques. Visual detections were more common per hour of effort than acoustical detections. Acoustical detection rates showed no significant day-night difference. Marine mammals appeared to have avoided very close ranges (< 100 m) from the seismic array during seismic acquisition, but the overall number of marine mammals in the observable radius (1-2 km) did not change significantly when the seismic source was "on" compared to "off." Marine mammals were observed in larger groups and appeared to have become less vocal when the seismic source was active. It should be noted however, that the results from this data gathering effort may be affected by potential sources of bias (such as the combination of data from,toothed and baleen whales). Signal processing of seismic source signatures indicated some high-frequency energy content consistent with expectations from earlier work. This analysis confirmed that most of the seismic energy was concentrated at lower frequencies (< 500 Hz). No low-frequency comparisons with near-field data could be made due to the geometry of the SPACMS recording hydrophones and seismic source, which resulted in the Lloyd's mirror effect obliterating low-frequency components in the SPACMS records. A wavelet-based denoising method was applied to improve the visibility of marine mammal vocalizations on a spectrogram display.

TI  - Visual and psychomotor performance of elite, intermediate and novice table tennis competitors
PY  - 1993
AB  - The purpose of this cross‐sectional study was to determine whether measures on a selected groups of visual and psychomotor variables distinguished between groups of elite, intermediate and novice table tennis players. The variables included commonly of Melbourne measured clinical functions such as static visual acuity, extent of visual field and oculomotor balance and more experimental visual tasks such as recognition of, peripheral targets, saccadic latency and dynamic visual acuity. Psychomotor performance was assessed by measures of simple reaction time, choice response time and hand movement time. Although elite level competitors had significantly better dynamic visual acuity, a wider visual field and superior recognition of peripheral targets compared to less skilled competitors, the magnitude, or practical significance of these differences was not great and individually accounted for less than 5 per cent of population variance. Elite competitors had significantly faster psychomotor responses than novice players with die skill variables individually accounting for between 21 per cent and 62 per cent of population variance in psychomotor performance. These results indicate that the psychomotor parameters could be a useful part of a test battery for talent identification amongst table tennis players. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

TI  - Visual and somatosensory processing in the macaque temporal cortex: the role of 'expectation'
PY  - 1990
AB  - The somatosensory and visual properties of cells in a polymodal region of temporal cortex were studied in 4 awake behaving macaque monkeys. When stimulated passively and out of sight, cells with tactile responses were found to have very large receptive fields covering most of the body surface and an apparent lack of selectivity for size, shape or texture of the tactile stimulus. These properties are equivalent to those described for the anaesthetized preparation (Bruce et al. 1981). Our study revealed that tactile responses were influenced by the degree to which stimuli could be 'expected'. Tactile stimulation arising from active exploration of novel surfaces produced vigourous neuronal responses but equivalent stimulation of the skin arising when the monkey contacted 'expected' surfaces such as itself or items with which it had become familiar produced no responses. The responses of cells to active or passive tactile stimulation were attenuated when the monkey could see the objects causing the stimulation. For cells responsive to more than one sensory modality, visual and somatosensory responses were associated in a compatible manner. Cells responsive to the onset of touch were selective for the sight of objects moving towards the monkey, whereas cells selective for the offset of touch were responsive to the sight of movements away from the monkey. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Visual and spatial working memory skills implicated in copying and drawing from memory of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure: What relationship in school-aged children?
PY  - 2020
AB  - The impact of age-related factors on the development of visual and spatial Working Memory (WM) and drawing skills implicated in the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test was examined in school-aged children. Additionally, this study investigated the role of non-verbal WM processes in shaping drawing performance. Ninety-four 7-, 10-, and 13-year-old children completed a battery of tasks assessing the efficiency of passive and active visual and spatial WM, visuo-constructive, visuo-motor, and visuo-spatial long-term memory functions. Results showed that WM, copy and drawing from memory of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure performances were impacted by developmental factors, that is, 7-year-old pupils were outperformed by 10-, and 13-year-old participants in many of the investigated measures. Finally, active visual WM processes predicted the accuracy of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure copying, whereas the copy of that geometric pattern and the efficiency of active simultaneous spatial WM accounted for the accuracy of the drawing from memory performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Visual attention & eye movement control: Causal saliency effects during natural vision
PY  - 2006
AB  - Salient stimuli, such as color or motion contrasts, attract human attention, thus providing a fast heuristic for focusing limited neural resources on behaviorally relevant sensory inputs. Here we address the following questions: What types of saliency attract attention and how do they compare to each other during natural vision? We asked human participants to inspect scene-shuffled video clips, tracked their instantaneous eye-position, and quantified how well a battery of computational saliency models predicted overt attentional selections (saccades). Saliency effects were measured as a function of total viewing time, proximity to abrupt scene transitions (jump cuts), and inter-participant consistency. All saliency models predicted overall attentional selection well above chance, with dynamic models being equally predictive to each other, and up to 3.6 times more predictive than static models. The prediction accuracy of all dynamic models was twice higher than their average for saccades that were initiated immediately after jump cuts, and led to maximal inter-participant consistency. Static models showed mixed results in these circumstances, with some models having weaker prediction accuracy than their average. These results demonstrate that dynamic visual cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention, while static visual cues correlate with attentional selection mostly due to top-down causes.

TI  - Visual attention control for nuclear power plant inspection
PY  - 2000
AB  - Industrial inspection robots, which are to move around a nuclear power plant and carry out inspection tasks, must follow a given route while observing static and dynamic features of the environment. To fulfill the visual sensing requirements of such a robot for both a wide field of view to ensure safe motion and high resolution to enable precise observation, we have developed a stereo active vision system equipped with foveated wide-field image acquisition and mounted it on a mobile robot.With this or other types of active sensors, only the foveated center of the field of view can extract precise information, so the camera pose must be controlled to fixate the target are for execution of a particular visual task. The activities of inspection robots lead to multiple visual tasks, requiring both reactive and premeditated types of attention, and therefore the robot must apply its sensing resources sequentially among multiple possibilities. In this paper, we propose a new framework for visual attention control for a mobile robot, describe the implementation of the proposed framework and show some examples in which the camera pose is controlled to achieve multiple visual tasks.

TI  - Visual attention shift-based event alarming for intelligent surveillance
PY  - 2013
AB  - As intelligent surveillance system has been widely used, the processing of surveillance videos is becoming more and more important. In this paper, a visual attention shift-based method is proposed to alarm the occurrence of likely-to-be-concerned (LTBC) events by key frame extraction. In the proposed method, the static and dynamic visual attention models are combined to extract the visual saliency ranges, according to the temporal changing of visual saliency ranges, the key frames are selected out to mark the occurrence of the LTBC events, and at the same time, the LTBC objects in the key frames are extracted and tracked in the former and latter frames. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can alarm the occurrence of the LTBC events with the extracted key frames correctly and the alarming is realtime, which is helpful to hold the dangerous event back or within limits in practice. The tracking results also show that the extracted LTBC objects are usually the main roles of the LTBC events, and they can be tracked in the video frames stably.

TI  - Visual bias of unseen hand position with a mirror: spatial and temporal factors
PY  - 2005
AB  - Two experiments examined the integration of visual and proprioceptive information concerning the location of an unseen hand, using a mirror positioned along the midsagittal plane. In experiment 1, participants tapped the fingers of both hands in synchrony, while viewing the mirror-reflection of their left hand. After 6 s, participants made reaching movements to a target with their unseen right hand behind the mirror. Reaches were accurate when visually and proprioceptively specified hand positions were congruent prior to the reach, but significantly biased by vision when the visual location conflicted with the real location. This effect was independent of the target location and depended strongly upon the relative position of the mirror-reflected hand. In experiment 2, participants made reaching movements following 4, 8, or 12 s active visuomotor or passive visual exposure to the mirror, or following passive exposure without the mirror. Reaching was biased more by the visual location following active visuomotor compared to passive visual exposure, and this bias increased with the duration of visual exposure. These results suggest that the felt position of the hand depends upon an integrated, weighted sum of visual and proprioceptive information. Visual information is weighted more strongly under active visuomotor than passive visual exposure, and with increasing exposure duration to the mirror reflected hand.

TI  - Visual causes versus correlates of attentional selection in dynamic scenes
PY  - 2006
AB  - What are the visual causes, rather than mere correlates, of attentional selection and how do they compare to each other during natural vision? To address these questions, we first strung together semantically unrelated dynamic scenes into MTV-style video clips, and performed eye tracking experiments with human observers. We then quantified predictions of saccade target selection based on seven bottom-up models, including intensity variance, orientation contrast, intensity contrast, color contrast, flicker contrast, motion contrast, and integrated saliency. On average, all tested models predicted saccade target selection well above chance. Dynamic models were particularly predictive of saccades that were most likely bottom-up driven-initiated shortly after scene onsets, leading to maximal inter-observer similarity. Static models showed mixed results in these circumstances, with intensity variance and orientation contrast featuring particularly weak prediction accuracy (lower than their own average, and approximately 4 times lower than dynamic models). These results indicate that dynamic visual cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention. In comparison, some static visual cues play a weaker causal role, while other static cues are not causal at all, and may instead reflect top-down causes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Visual characteristics of clay target shooters.
PY  - 1999
AB  - A comprehensive battery of standardised visual tests was administered to 11 skilled and 12 novice clay target shooters in an attempt to determine the distinctive visual characteristics of expert performers in this sport. The static and dynamic visual acuity, ocular muscle balance, ocular dominance, depth perception and colour vision of each of the subjects was measured in addition to their performance on simple and choice reaction time, peripheral response time, rapid tachistoscopic detection, coincidence timing and eye movement skills tasks. Expert superiority was observed on the simple reaction time measure only, and the novices actually outperformed the skilled subjects on a number of the other visual measures (viz., static acuity at near distance, dynamic acuity, vertical ocular muscle balance, choice reaction time and rapid target detection discriminability). Scores on all measures for both groups were within the expected normal range indicating that normal and not necessarily above-average basic visual functioning is sufficient to support skilled clay target shooting. An important implication of the finding that skilled shooters are not characterised by supranormal levels of basic visual functioning is the recognition that any attempt to improve shooting performance through training of general attributes of vision to supranormal levels is likely to be unproductive.

TI  - Visual characteristics of the driver to tunnel group traffic safety
PY  - 2011
AB  - Analyzing the influence of the drivers' visual changes in highway tunnel groups on traffic safety, this paper made a test on 100 drivers' visual characteristics on Tongling to Tangkou (Anhui) expressway traffic tunnel group using the dynamic visual acuity tester. The results showed that: the drivers are relatively prone to accident in the tunnel group environment. After driving through the expressway tunnel group, drivers' dynamic visions are 47.12 percent and even up to 90.18 percent compromised, compared to their respective static vision. According to the gray system, a gray relation analysis model of visual characteristics was established. The results showed that the driving age, driving experience and continuous driving time all had strong correlations with drivers' dynamic vision, in which the continuous driving time dominates other factors. This paper could in theory provide a useful or practical way for the design and safety management of the expressway tunnel group. © 2011 ASCE.

TI  - Visual control of locomotion in Parkinson's disease
PY  - 1999
AB  - The effect of placing parallel lines on the walking surface on parkinsonian gait was evaluated, To identify the kind of visual cues (static or dynamic) required for the control of locomotion, we tested two visual conditions: normal lighting and stroboscopic illumination (three flashes/s), the latter acting to suppress dynamic visual cues completely, Sixteen subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (nine males, seven females; mean age 68.8 years) and the same number of age-matched controls (seven males; nine females, mean age 67.5 years) were studied, During the baseline phase, Parkinson's disease patients walked with a short-stepped, slow velocity pattern. The double limb support duration was increased and the step cadence was reduced relative to normal. Under normal lighting, visual cues from the lines on the walking surface induced a significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length in Parkinson's disease patients, With stroboscopic illumination and without lines, both groups reduced their stride length and velocity but the changes were significant only in the Parkinson's disease group, indicating greater dependence on dynamic visual information. When stroboscopic light was used with stripes on the poor, the improvement in gait due to the stripes was suppressed in parkinsonian patients, These results demonstrate that the perceived motion of stripes, induced by the patient's walking, is essential to improve the gait parameters and thus favour the hypothesis of a specific visual-motor pathway which is particularly responsive to rapidly moving targets. Previous studies have proposed a cerebellar circuit, allowing the visual stimuli to by-pass the damaged basal ganglia.

TI  - Visual correction of a rapid goal-directed response.
PY  - 1986
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of dynamic and static visual cues in improvement of accuracy during a pointing movement. In the experiment, subjects were required to point finger rapidly at visual targets as accurately as possible. Movement amplitude was 15 cm, and movement times ranged from 100 to 190 msec. Three visual feedback conditions were applied: no feedback, dynamic ongoing feedback on the complete hand trajectory, and static error feedback on the movement end-point. Two spatial movement outcomes were considered, mean constant error and intraindividual dispersion of pointings. Data were analyzed with regard to effects of feedback and speed. Under the no-feedback condition, accuracy was lowest; constant error was not speed-dependent, whereas dispersion increased with speed of movement. Accuracy was highest under the complete feedback condition and was speed-dependent, as shown by both constant error and dispersion. Under error feedback, accuracy was intermediate and was also speed-dependent. The results are discussed in terms of the interchange between correcting mechanisms vs delayed control within the motor regulatory processes.

TI  - Visual detection of coarticulatory anticipation or... guessing what has not yet been written
PY  - 1993
AB  - Emerging technology in communication systems requires the consideration of specific psycholinguistic phenomena for the conception of optimally efficient devices. The reported study focuses on a phenomenon observed in speech and cursive handwriting, namely, the visual detection of coarticulatory anticipation, and examines, in particular, the contribution of visible motor information in linguistic message decoding. Visual dynamic and static diagram and word stimuli-prepared by reproducing identical spatial templates, and on the basis of the presence of coarticulatory anticipation in the handwriting movements-were administered without providing spatial cues on the identity of the subsequent letter. Results indicate that when kinematic information was provided in the dynamic visual stimulus, subjects were able to predict with fair accuracy the identity of the following letter. When the only information supplied by the stimulus was the static trace of the production, subjects could not predict the identity of the following one. Therefore, the visual system detects temporal differences that translate anticipatory gestures in the production movements.

TI  - Visual feature based on BTSM-LDA and multi-stream asynchrony model for audio-visual speech recognition
PY  - 2008
AB  - A robust dynamic visual feature extraction method based on Bayesian tangent shape model (BTSM) and linear discrimination analysis (LDA) is proposed. Based on lip outline feature points extracted by BTSM, LDA is used to extract dynamic visual speech feature. The proposed method processes temporal lip motion information and eliminates the redundancy of lip geometrical feature. Meanwhile, a multi-stream asynchrony dynamic Bayesian network (MS-ADBN) model is introduced for audio-visual speech recognition. Compared with multi-stream hidden Markov model (MSHMM), MS-ADBN model describes the asynchrony of the audio stream and the visual stream to the work level. Speech recognition experiments are done on digit audio-visual speech database. Experimental results show that the dynamic visual feature based on BTSM and LDA is more static and robust than direct lip geometrical feature. In the noisy environment with signal to noise ratios from 0-30 dB, the average speech recognition rate of MS-ADBN model is 4.92% higher than that of the MSHMM.

TI  - Visual feedback of the non-moving limb improves active joint-position sense of the impaired limb in Spastic Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study examined the active joint-position sense in children with Spastic Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy (SHCP) and the effect of static visual feedback and static mirror visual feedback, of the non-moving limb, on the joint-position sense. Participants were asked to match the position of one upper limb with that of the contralateral limb. The task was performed in three visual conditions: without visual feedback (no vision); with visual feedback of the non-moving limb (screen); and with visual feedback of the non-moving limb and its mirror reflection (mirror). In addition to the proprioceptive measure, a functional test [Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST)] was performed and the amount of spasticity was determined in order to examine their relation with proprioceptive ability. The accuracy of matching was significantly influenced by the distance that had to be covered by the matching limb; a larger distance resulted in a lower matching accuracy. Moreover it was demonstrated that static (mirror) visual feedback improved the matching accuracy. A clear relation between functionality, as measured by the QUEST, and active joint-position sense was not found. This might be explained by the availability of visual information during the performance of the QUEST. It is concluded that static visual feedback improves matching accuracy in children with SHCP and that the initial distance between the limbs is an influential factor which has to be taken into account when measuring joint-position sense.

TI  - Visual field attenuation of forest fire engine driver under four-dimensional structure
PY  - 2012
AB  - Starting with the research on four-dimensional dynamic visual field, this paper establishes a virtual visual field test system of forest fire engine, makes experiments of the driver's intuitional judgment during operating visual field equipment, and gets the attenuation value of forest fire engine driver's visual field under four-dimensional dynamic structure. The results showed that the visual field attenuation occurred with the dynamic structure; the reason for attenuation was that the influence of time and environment was neglected under three-dimensional static test; there were design and manufacturing defects in existing forest fire engine visual field equipment; this research on attenuation under four-dimensional dynamic structure will be helpful to breakthrough design on the equipment of forest fire engine visual field.

TI  - Visual field change after pars plana vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy
PY  - 1998
AB  - We evaluated the results of surgery performed to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) by examinining visual fields in 43 eyes of 35 patients who had undergone vitrectomy for PDR and had postoperative visual acuity of 0.6 or better. Eyes with a history of glaucoma or ocular hypertension were excluded from this study. For eyes with stable postoperative visual acuity of 0.6 or better, visual fields were measured dynamically by Goldmann perimetry and statically by Humphrey perimetry; fluorescein angiography and measurement of the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) were performed at the same visit. Although 37 of the 43 eyes had some abnormal features on dynamic visual field testing, no characteristic pattern could be identified. When measured against general standards for handicapped persons, the proportion of visual field lost in the central portion was 83.9 ± 8.8% for patients in this series. Fluorescein angiography results did not correlate with changes in visual field after vitrectomy for PDR in these patients: the mean deviations in static visual field testing results were -12.9 ± 5.2 dB and the average CFF was 34.1 ± 7.0 Hz. These results show the importance of measuring the visual field in addition to visual acuity to evaluate visual function after vitrectomy for PDR.

TI  - Visual function of English Premier League soccer players
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose: Examine visual function of soccer players of different skill level and playing position. Methods: Elite players from an English Premier League soccer club (n = 49) and intermediate players (n = 31) completed an assessment on a Nike SPARQ Sensory Station of: static and dynamic visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, accommodative vergence facility, target capture and perception span. Results: There was no difference between elite and intermediate players for all measures. However, competitive soccer players (elite, intermediate) did exhibit better performance in acuity-based measures of visual function and accommodative vergence compared to a population of healthy non-athletic adults (n = 230). With regards to player position, defensive players showed quicker accommodative vergence facility compared with offensive players. Conclusion: Visual function of competitive soccer players is superior to non-athletic adults, but does not differentiate the elite and intermediate player. However, defensive players do exhibit faster accommodative vergence than offensive players. We suspect that this particular visual function is advantageous for defenders given the greater demand to continually shift gaze between players located at near and far locations. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Some critical factors related with movement in visual motor adjustment are studied (active or passive movement, starting and terminal position limb). Two 'open loop' tests are used: manual locating of a visual target, and visual locating of a manual position, without visual control of movement in both cases. The results suggest the distinction between a ballistic movement and a movement modulated by way of peripheral feedback, which differ one from the other by performance in spatial accuracy and cues used.

TI  - Visual perception of static and dynamic two-dimensional objects
PY  - 1974
AB  - Investigated differences between visual perception of static (nonmoving) and dynamic (moving) 2-dimensional objects at several ages. The ability of 4 age groups (6-7, 11-13, 18-22, and 66-79 yrs) to perceive figure-ground was assessed. A total of 129 Ss were tested. A test of visual perception of figure-ground was selected and adapted to a dynamic condition. Results show a significant difference between performance on the static and dynamic tests of visual perception across all age levels, with fewer errors made on the dynamic test. There was a significant difference in performance between ages. It is concluded that there is a difference between static and dynamic visual perception of figure-ground at the ages studied and that perception of figure-ground tends to improve with age.

TI  - Visual perception strategies for 3d reconstruction
PY  - 1997
AB  - We propose in this paper an active vision approach for performing the 3D reconstruction of static scenes. The perception-action cycles are handled at various levels: from the definition of perception strategies for scene exploration downto the automatic generation of camera motions using visual servoing. To perform the reconstruction we use a structure from controlled motion method which allows a robust estimation of primitive parameters. As this method is based on particular camera motions, perceptual strategies able to appropriately perform a succession of such individual primitive reconstructions are proposed in order to recover the complete spatial structure of complex scenes. Two algorithms are proposed to ensure the exploration of the scene. The former is an incremental reconstruction algorithm based on the use of a prediction/verification scheme managed using decision theory and Bayes Nets. It allows the visual system to get a complete high level description of the observed part of the scene. The latter, based on the computation of new viewpointsC ensures the complete reconstruction of the scene. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.

TI  - Visual perceptual skills and reading abilities in Chinese-speaking children
PY  - 2002
AB  - Studied the relations between children's visual perception and Chinese character-reading ability. 48 5th graders (aged 10–11.5 yrs) in China were tested in the tasks of measuring coherent motion detection threshold, amount of Chinese characters known (ACK), reading fluency (RF), phonological awareness (PA), picture naming (PN), and orthographic similarity judgment (SJ). 15 Ss with low ACK and RF were selected for further study of their dynamic motion detection threshold and PA. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were used. The results show that dynamic motion detection threshold was correlated with the error rate in PN and the reaction time (RT) and error rate in SJ; and that static motion detection threshold was only correlated with the error rate in PN, but the correlation disappeared when ACK was controlled. The results also show that dynamic motion detection threshold accounted for 7%, 25%, and 56% for RF, RT of SJ, and the error rate of PN, after ACK and PA being controlled; that PA accounted for 9% and 10% for ACK and RF; and that individual difference was significant. The study concludes that reading is affected by visual perception that can be localized to specific processes in Chinese character reading.

TI  - Visual performance under the aspect age [Visuelle leistungen unter dem aspekt alter]
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective of the study: 20-50 % of older persons have a reduced eyesight, the are not aware of, but that might in most cases be correctable. The pure visual acuity does not show the eyesight in daily life. Next to the glare sensitivity are the contrast sensitivity (often referred to as the "gold standard") and the dynamic vision test required for a complete eye examination. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of age on the static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and afferent dynamic vision (based on motion contrast). Methods and subjects: 68 test persons took part voluntarily in the study in the age range of 19.8-64.3 years. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (KE) were determined with the VCTS-board of the VISTECH-company. The afferent dynamic vision was grasped by means of Dusseldorf test for dynamic seeing (DTDS) by Wist. Results: All of the different age groups showed a median visual acuity of 1.0. They were comparable concerning static visual acuity and KE with each other. The age groups differed significantly concerning the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). The age group with the test persons between 20 and 25 years achieved better results compared to the group 46 to 65 years: 94.6 ± 9.7 % vs. 79.2 ± 19.0 % (p = 0.002) of right answers in the DTDS. The age correlated negative with the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A negative influence of the age on the static visual acuity and the KE was not confirmed. It became clear that with increasing age the afferent dynamic vision decreased. The test persons between 46 and 65 years achieved in the DTDS on average only 79 % of afferent dynamic vision. The older the test persons were, the worse was their afferent dynamic vision.

TI  - Visual ratings of the vertical jump are weakly correlated with perceptual style
PY  - 2000
AB  - The association between visual perceptual style, visual ratings of joint angles and range of motion in the vertical jump was studied in kinesiology majors. Forty-three undergraduates volunteered to rate vertical jumps from real-time videotape replay (Knudson, 1999), estimate joint angles from stickfigures and take the Group Embedded Figures Test and Mental Rotations Test. Error scores and correlations between ratings and actual measurements were calculated. There were no significant (p < 0.05) correlations between visual perceptual scores and ability to rate angles, range of motion or errors in ratings for a videotape replay. There was a weak but significant correlation (r = -0.31, p < 0.05) between the Group Embedded Figures Test scores and absolute errors in estimating angles in static stickfigures of vertical jumps. Forty percent of the subjects could make valid holistic estimates of range of motion in the vertical jump. These data suggests that only a minority of these students had skill in the assessment of dynamic movement and this ability is not strongly related to common measures of perceptual style.

TI  - Visual representations and mental models: Thinking about probability
PY  - 2003
AB  - Knowledge can be delivered to learners through different types of representations—plain text or visual format, static or animated format, and passive or interactive format. Types of representations profoundly impact learning performance. In other words, different types of representations shape how people comprehend the knowledge. How people comprehend the knowledge influences the way they reason. This research aimed to investigate whether different types of representations influence learning and to examine why and how the representations affect learning.    Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of computer animations in different instructional environments. Visual representations are considered to be effective modes of depicting information in instructional technology environments. Mental model theory offers a useful lens for examining how and why visual representations lead to better reasoning ability. The objectives of this research are to (1) explore how levels of interactivity and dynamism of representations in probability influence levels of dynamism in student mental models of probability and (2) investigate whether levels of dynamism in mental models influence probability reasoning. The software presents probability problems in five representations—Standard Text representation (ST), Static Visual representation (SV), Computer-Animated representation (CA), Interactive Computer-Animated representation (ICA), and Static Visual representation with Motion Cues (SV-MC).    There are three major findings. First, students who received visual representations outperformed students who received ST representation. The results support that visual representations have positive effects on students' learning performance. Second, the results show that higher levels of dynamism of representations (i.e. CA, ICA, and SV-MC representations) generated a greater number of images in learners' mental models. This leads to conclude that higher levels of dynamic movement of representational resources foster flexible and dynamic mental models that allow for better reasoning about probability. Third, the SV-MC and CA groups performed similarly and both outperformed other groups. However, on more complex problem sets, the SV-MC group outperformed all other groups. This finding suggests that movements that learners have to create on their own simulate higher levels of dynamism in mental models than movements that the computer generated for them.

TI  - Visual resolution as measured by dynamic and static tests
PY  - 1972
AB  - Static visual acuity has been measured as a function of target exposure time; dynamic visual acuity as a function of target velocity. The ranges were 6-120 msec for flash exposures and 22-167°/sec for angular velocities. Frequency of seeing curves were used to determine thresholds for two groups of observers, aged 20-30 years and 40-50 years. Visual acuity is found to deteriorate rapidly with angular velocity. The product-moment correlation and the correlation ratio were calculated in order to reveal any relation between static and dynamic visual acuity. There is no statistically significant relationship between these two types of visual discrimination abilities either in a linear or a curvilinear fashion. Quantification of visual performance in terms of equal resolving power of the eye for a target velocity and corresponding momentary target exposure is found to be possible only up to 60°/sec. A senile decline in acuity was observed; dioptric factors of the eye are shown to have more far reaching consequences than any age effect associated with the function of the oculomotor system. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Visual-haptic perception of compliance: Direct matching of visual and haptic information
PY  - 2007
AB  - Visual-haptic perception of an object's compliance demands integration of haptic position and force information as well as visual position information. In this investigation the role of active exploration on visual perception as well as the influence of visualhaptic information was addressed Participants were instructed to directly match a compliant stimulus displayed either by vision (static passive or active), haptics, or both. Active testing of the visually displayed cube resulted in no difference in visual thresholds, suggesting that exploration method did not influence visual position discrimination. However, the threshold of visual matching of the cube's indentation was smaller than for haptic compliance matching, not only unimodally but bimodally, in which case the alternate modality was present and adds noise resulting in an increase in bimodal thresholds. © 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Visual-motor adaptation to stabilize perceptual world: Its generality and specificity
PY  - 2005
AB  - Though the retinal image changes drastically with the movement of our head or eyes, our perceptual world is stable. It is called visual stability or position constancy. When we observe a virtual-reality environment through a head-mounted display with moving our head, the perceptual world is stabilized by the appropriate visual-motor gain without significant system delay. It is known that when the gain is changed the visual stability adaptively changes. We aimed to know the generality and specificity of this adaptation to stabilize the perceptual world: What is limitation for the ability of our adaptive visual-motor system? We found that the visual-motor adaptation occurred irrespective of the amount of visual information or active/passive movement. Even though the eye for adapting and that for test were different, the adaptation was intact. When the retinal location (left or right hemi-field) for test was different from that for adaptation, the adaptation still occurred, but it was less than in the case of same retinal location. Thus, the visual-motor adaptation for visual stability is concerned with relatively higher information processing, at least after the fusion of binocular sources, but is specific to or modulated by the retinal location.

TI  - Visual-motor organization: differences between and within individuals.
PY  - 1982
AB  - The research described in this monograph uses control theory's pursuit-tracking paradigm of voluntary movement to identify several elementary psychomotor tasks. They are simple to administer and tap increasingly complex, nonverbal cognitive or perceptual attributes. Two series of experiments are reported. Study 1 examined the hypothesis that dissimilar arrays of individual differences, as determined through test-retest correlations, may exist among the same subjects: first, across various static and dynamic visual and motor "tasks" selected from the terms of control theory's tracking equations and, second, in the organization of these tasks as represented by pursuit tracking. The hypothesis could not be rejected. Study 2 determined that test-retest individual differences in visual-motor organization not only persisted in the absence of practice, but that they also withstood active intervention by practice. This study also showed that subjects differ reliably in their ability to plan, i.e., to take advantage of coherence in visual-motor information.

TI  - Visual-vestibular interaction in humans during active and passive, vertical head movement.
PY  - 1993
AB  - We studied visual-vestibular interaction (VVI) in 9 normal human subjects using active and passive vertical head rotations. Gain and phase of the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and visually enhanced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) were measured for single frequency sinusoidal motion, as well as for sinusoidal motion of continuously increasing frequency, over the range of 0.4 to 4.0 Hz. In addition to measurement of VVOR during normal vision, telescopic spectacles having a magnification of 1.9x were used to challenge VVI to facilitate measurement of visual enhancement of VOR gain. In the mid-frequency range (1.6 to 2.4 Hz), the active VOR exhibited gain closer to compensatory than did the passive VOR; at other frequencies, active and passive VOR gains were similar. VVOR gain during normal vision was compensatory for both active and passive motion throughout the frequency range tested. VVOR gain with 1.9x telescopic spectacles was greater than VOR gain at all frequencies tested, including up to 3.2 Hz for passive head movements, and up to 4.0 Hz for active head movement. However, gain enhancement with telescopic spectacles was consistently greater during active than during passive head movement. Phase errors for the VOR and VVOR were small under all testing conditions. Although active VOR and VVOR were directionally symmetrical, gain of upward slow phases differed from that of downward slow phases for passive VOR and VVOR in a manner depending on rotational frequency. For both active and passive testing, gain and phase values obtained during swept frequency rotations were similar to those obtained during single frequency sinusoidal testing. These data indicate that VVI can enhance gain of the passive vertical VOR even at frequencies above what is usually considered to be the upper limit of visual pursuit tracking. The additional enhancement observed during active head movements at these high frequencies is attributable to use of efference copy of the skeletal motor command to neck musculature.

TI  - Visualization and quantification of in vivo femorotibial contact in total knee arthroplasty by X-ray fluoroscopic image analysis
PY  - 2007
AB  - In this study, we present a novel technique to evaluate in vivo femorotbial contact in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) during dynamic motion. Knowledge of joint contact and its area in TKA during dynamic motion could not only provide kinematic information dependent on articular shape but also assist in improving the design of TKA that include tibial polyethylene insert. In previous studies, joint contact in TKA has been evaluated using pressure sensitive film or digital tactile sensor. However these techniques are limited because they are only able to operate under static in vitro or quasidynamic conditions, and cannot be physically applied to TKA patients under dynamic in vivo conditions. To materialize evaluation of femorotibial contact under dynamic in vivo conditions, we employ a computer vision technique called 2D/3D registration, which estimate the 3D pose of radiopaque metallic femoral and tibal components using X-ray fluoroscopic image and computer-aided design (CAD) model of the implant. Although the polyethylene insert is radiolucent and does not appear on fluoroscopic image, in fixed-bearing TKA, the insert can be assumed to be fixed on the tibial tray. Therefore, the 3D pose of the insert can be easily determined, as the pose of tibial component was estimated. To visualize and quantify femorotibial contact, the proximity between surfaces of femoral component and insert is calculated, and mapped onto the insert surface model. The femorotibial contact was visualized and quantified as the region on the insert surface where the proximity is less than 0.5 mm threshold, and the threshold value was determined from the result of 3D pose estimation accuracy by phantom experiments. In clinical applications, the evaluation of femorotibial contact was performed using images from a fixed-bearing TKA patient during dynamic motion. Dynamic states of the contact were visualized and quantified including axial rotation and unilateral loading during knee flexion, and post-cam contact of posterior stabilized TKA. The present technique provided us new information and enabled us to better understand or predict the location, translation and size of the contact region during in vivo dynamic motion.

TI  - Visualization of Linear Algebra concepts with Sage and GeoGebra
PY  - 2013
AB  - This work started with recent students’ conception on Linear Algebra. We were trying to help their understanding of Linear Algebra concepts by adding visualization tools. To accomplish this, we have developed most of needed tools for teaching of Linear Algebra class. Visualizing concepts of Linear Algebra is not only an aid for understanding but also arouses students’ interest on the subject for a better comprehension, which further helps the students to play with them for self-discovery. Therefore, visualizing data should be prepared thoroughly rather than just merely understanding on static pictures as a special circumstance when we would study visual object. By doing this, we carefully selected GeoGebra which is suitable for dynamic visualizing and Sage for algebraic computations. We discovered that this combination is proper for visualizing to be embodied and gave a variety of visualizing data for undergraduate mathematics classes. We utilized GeoGebra and Sage for dynamic visualizing and tools used for algebraic calculation as creating a new kind of visual object for university math classes.We visualized important concepts of Linear Algebra as much as we can according to the order of the textbook. We offered static visual data for understanding and studied visual object and further prepared a circumstance that could create new knowledge. We found that our experience on visualizations in Linear Algebra using Sage and GeoGebra to our class can be effectively adopted to other university math classes. It is expected that this contribution has a positive effect for school math education as well as the other lectures in university.

TI  - Visualizing speech with a recurrent neural network trained on human acoustic-articulatory data.
PY  - 1999
AB  - A method is presented for converting acoustic speech data into a visual representation of articulation using a recurrent neural network. Target values for the network were created by finding the principal components of sets of video frames representing the face and tongue of the speaker. Midsagittal images of the tongue were captured using ultrasound. When trained on a corpus of voiced stops, the network estimated the magnitude of the principal component loads with an average accuracy of 14% of the range of variation. When the load estimates were converted into moving images, the appropriate bilabial, alveolar, and velar gestures were clearly apparent. Feedforward networks trained on the same task were unable to distinguish the consonants, indicating more inconsistency in the static acoustic-articulatory mapping than in the mapping between dynamic acoustic and articulatory trajectories. Because the networks averaged over disparate targets associated with similar inputs, they tended to under-represent articulatory aberrations, in a sense "cleaning up" articulatory variability. In a direct test of the usefulness of the estimated articulatory images, human subjects were shown, under conditions of simulated hearing impairment, images of moving lips produced by a network trained on a corpus of spoken digits. Performance rose from less than 50% to over 80% correct recognition when the acoustically-driven network output movies were displayed. In light of this performance, and inspired by the rough similarities between artificial and biological neural networks, a new hypothesis for human speech perception is formulated in which articulatory representations play an important role. The hypothesis differs from established motor theories of speech perception in that gestural representations are not taken to be innate or essential, but instead learned through experience and developed in response to low-level neurophysiological pressures rather than to behavioral-level needs.

TI  - Visually Evoked 3-5 Hz Membrane Potential Oscillations Reduce the Responsiveness of Visual Cortex Neurons in Awake Behaving Mice
PY  - 2017
AB  - Low-frequency membrane potential (V-m) oscillations were once thought to only occur in sleeping and anesthetized states. Recently, low-frequency V-m oscillations have been described in inactive awake animals, but it is unclear whether they shape sensory processing in neurons and whether they occur during active awake behavioral states. To answer these questions, we performed two-photon guided whole-cell V-m recordings from primary visual cortex layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and performance of visual and auditory discrimination tasks. We recorded stereotyped 3-5 Hz V-m oscillations where the Vm baseline hyperpolarized as the V-m underwent high amplitude rhythmic fluctuations lasting 1-2 s in duration. When 3-5 Hz V-m oscillations coincided with visual cues, excitatory neuron responses to preferred cues were significantly reduced. Despite this disruption to sensory processing, visual cues were critical for evoking 3-5 Hz V-m oscillations when animals performed discrimination tasks and passively viewed drifting grating stimuli. Using pupillometry and animal locomotive speed as indicators of arousal, we found that 3-5 Hz oscillations were not restricted to unaroused states and that they occurred equally in aroused and unaroused states. Therefore, low-frequency V-m oscillations play a role in shaping sensory processing in visual cortical neurons, even during active wakefulness and decision making.

TI  - Visually induced postural reactivity in glaucoma
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To evaluate postural reactivity in glaucoma patients using a dynamic virtual reality environment. Methods Patients underwent evaluation of postural stability by a force platform (Figure 1) during presentation of static and dynamic visual stimuli on stereoscopic head-mounted goggles (Figure 2). The dynamic visual stimuli presented rotational and translational ecologically valid peripheral background perturbations. Postural stability was also tested in a completely dark field to assess somatosensory and vestibular contributions to postural control. History of falls was evaluated by a standard questionnaire. Torque moments around the center of foot pressure on the force platform were measured and the standard deviations (STD) of these torque moments were calculated as a measurement of postural stability and reported in Newton meters (Nm). The ability to predict history of falls was investigated with Poisson regression models. Age, gender, body mass index, severity of visual field defect, best-corrected visual acuity, and STD on dark field condition were included as confounding factors. Results Forty-two glaucoma patients with repeatable visual field defects on standard automated perimetry (SAP) and 38 control healthy subjects were included. Glaucoma patients had larger overall STD than controls during both translational (5.12 +/- 2.39 Nm vs. 3.85 +/- 1.82 Nm, respectively; P = 0.005) as well as rotational stimuli (5.60 +/- 3.82 Nm vs. 3.93 +/- 2.07 Nm, respectively; P = 0.022). Postural metrics obtained during dynamic visual stimuli performed better in predicting history of falls compared to those obtained in static and dark field condition. In the multivariable model that included STD values in the mediolateral direction during translational stimulus, each 1 Nm larger STD was associated with an increase of 87% in the incident rate of falls in glaucoma patients (incidence-rate ratio = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.31-2.66; P = 0.001). Conclusions The study presented and validated a novel paradigm for evaluation of balance control in glaucoma patients based on the assessment of postural reactivity to dynamic visual stimuli using a virtual reality environment. The newly developed metrics were able to predict risk of falls and may help to provide a better understanding of balance control in glaucoma patients.

TI  - Visuals for Information Access: A New Philosophy for Screen and Interface Design
PY  - 1995
AB  - Computer-based instruction (CBI) has undergone tremendous changes in the past decade. This paper focuses on the following three areas of designing information presentation: (1) screen design literature is dated, and the existing guidelines do not allow for advances in computer technology; (2) open-ended guidelines may offer designers sufficient guidance for designing computer screens and user interfaces without stifling the creativity of the individual designer; (3) the paradigm of static screens has changed to one of active, interactive, screens filled with dynamic visual elements. The evolution of computer use and graphical user interface design, and the outdated literature are briefly described. Browsing is presented as a broad concept of interface design in computer-based learning environments, and seven guidelines for browsing are presented. Icons are proposed as a way in which CBI programs can use graphics (as opposed to the traditional redundancy between the object and the representational text.) Icons are considered dynamic, and are differentiated from static graphics because they show the user that a choice is available. Interactive graphics, animations, and interactive text are other examples of possible screen dynamics. This paradigmatic shift is a move away from thinking of screens as individual pieces of the program, and a move towards thinking of screens as thread that can hold the interface and the program together. Three figures illustrate a CBI program interface. (Contains 22 references.) (MAS)

TI  - Visuelle leistungen unter dem aspekt alter
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective of the study: 20-50 % of older persons have a reduced eyesight, the are not aware of, but that might in most cases be correctable. The pure visual acuity does not show the eyesight in daily life. Next to the glare sensitivity are the contrast sensitivity (often referred to as the "gold standard") and the dynamic vision test required for a complete eye examination. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of age on the static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and afferent dynamic vision (based on motion contrast). Methods and subjects: 68 test persons took part voluntarily in the study in the age range of 19.8-64.3 years. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (KE) were determined with the VCTS-board of the VISTECH-company. The afferent dynamic vision was grasped by means of Dusseldorf test for dynamic seeing (DTDS) by Wist. Results: All of the different age groups showed a median visual acuity of 1.0. They were comparable concerning static visual acuity and KE with each other. The age groups differed significantly concerning the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). The age group with the test persons between 20 and 25 years achieved better results compared to the group 46 to 65 years: 94.6 ± 9.7 % vs. 79.2 ± 19.0 % (p = 0.002) of right answers in the DTDS. The age correlated negative with the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A negative influence of the age on the static visual acuity and the KE was not confirmed. It became clear that with increasing age the afferent dynamic vision decreased. The test persons between 46 and 65 years achieved in the DTDS on average only 79 % of afferent dynamic vision. The older the test persons were, the worse was their afferent dynamic vision.

AB  - Examined some factors associated with visual-motor adjustment (e.g., active or passive movement, starting and terminal position limb). Two "open loop" tests were used: manual location of a visual target and visual location of a manual position, without visual control of movement in both cases. Results suggest a distinction between a ballistic movement and a movement modulated by way of peripheral feedback, which differ one from the other by performance in spatial accuracy and cues used.

TI  - Visuo-spatial processing in a dynamic and a static working memory paradigm in schizophrenia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Recent findings suggest that the visuo-spatial sketchpad (VSSP) may be divided into two sub-components processing dynamic or static visual information. This model may be useful to elucidate the confusion of data concerning the functioning of the VSSP in schizophrenia. The present study examined patients with schizophrenia and matched controls in a new working memory paradigm involving dynamic (the Ball Flight Task-BFT) or static (the Static Pattern Task-SPT) visual stimuli. In the BFT, the responses of the patients were apparently based on the retention of the last set of segments of the perceived trajectory, whereas control subjects relied on a more global strategy. We assume that the patients' performances are the result of a reduced capacity in chunking visual information since they relied mainly on the retention of the last set of segments. This assumption is confirmed by the poor performance of the patients in the static task (SPT), which requires a combination of stimulus components into object representations. We assume that the static/dynamic distinction may help us to understand the VSSP deficits in schizophrenia. This distinction also raises questions about the hypothesis that visuo-spatial working memory can simply be dissociated into visual and spatial sub-components. (c) 2006 Elsevier lreland Ltd.

TI  - Visuo-spatial working memory: an emergent feature of representing stimuli in the processing network for visual information
PY  - 2010
AB  - In the multi-component model, a separate visual working memory is postulated that is subdivided into a visual cache representing static visual information and an inner scribe realizing a dynamic rehearsal process. In this paper it is argued that the division into these two components - into static vs. dynamic information - is conceptually not precise and that it is not suitable to correctly describe the empirical results. Neuroscientific results suggest a distinction between spatial and visual information instead of static and dynamic. The former is not only visual, and the latter can be further differentiated according to the represented perceptual content. It is furthermore argued that a separate buffer is not necessary to explain the results from visuo-spatial working memory studies. It is sufficient to consider temporary memory as a consequence of activating representations in the course of perceptual visual processing. Consequenty, the same network that realizes visual information processing also provides visual working and long-term memory.

TI  - Visuomotor functions of central thalamus in monkey. II. Unit activity related to visual events, targeting, and fixation
PY  - 1984
AB  - In alert monkeys, single-unit responses to visual stimuli were recorded in the central thalamic region where eye movement-related activity has been observed (33). Usually, the stimuli were 1° annulus patterns of dim light presented at unpredictable locations on a tangent screen. The animals were trained on two tasks: one in which they delivered the stimulus themselves by pressing a panel that they had to release immediately when the stimulus shape changed to a square, and another one in which the stimulus was turned on by the experiment and the monkeys were rewarded for fixating this target for a predetermined length of time. In both tasks, continuous stimulus fixation was required. Receptive fields were tested with and without a fixation point. Retinal coordinates of stimuli were obtained by subtracting eye-position coordinates from stimulus coordinates in space, the monkeys' head being fixed. Unit responses in the cases where targeting occurred or did not occur were analyzed separately. Transient responses were observed in 63 units and sustained responses in 44 units. Among the 63 units responding transiently, 42 did so irrespective of targeting. Their receptive fields were very large, generally including the fovea, and predominantly contralateral when the fields were asymmetric. The response of the other 21 units depended on the occurrence of targeting. They were called visually triggered eye movement-related responses (VTEM). VTEM units were further subdivided in 9 units active only with targeting and 12 units showing the classical phenomenon of 'response enhancement' under this condition. VTEM units were contrasted to six units that were both passively visually responsive and bursting with saccades, either spontaneous or visually triggered. The latencies of passive visual and VTEM responses to stimulus onset were comprised between 77 and 135 ms in 80% of the units. VTEM units also fired prior to retargeting saccades. Presaccadic units active with spontaneous saccades also discharged with visually elicited saccades. The earliest sign of activation after stimulus onset eliciting a saccade appeared between 80 and 100 ms, that is, in the same range of latencies as passive visual and VTEM units. Sustained visual responses consisted of activation in 18 units and inactivation in 26 units. The occurrence of these patterns of firing was related to stimulus fixation. In the majority of cases, the changes in discharge frequency started before fixation was achieved by a targeting saccade. They terminated before fixation was broken by a saccade away from the stimulus. But if the stimulus was turned off first, the pattern of fixation persisted until the next saccade. Transient and sustained visual responses were recorded more frequently in the rostral part of the thalamic region where eye movement-related units have been isolated. Visual and eye movement units were often intermixed. Some units belonged to both classes. Transient visual units are interpreted as event detectors and fixation units as providing a signal holding the gaze on target. The general characteristics of the thalamic structures investigated are reviewed. Their significance is discussed and it is proposed that the role of this cell population is to control cortical operations directing the gaze.

TI  - Visuoperceptual and visuomotor deficits in developmental stutterers: An exploratory study
PY  - 2002
AB  - Although the cause of stuttering is unknown, there is strong evidence for it being a neuromotor disorder characterised by an abnormality of higher control encompassing not only speech but other motor systems. The aim of this exploratory study was to look for the presence of non-speech/language deficits - in particular, visuomotor and visuoperceptual deficits - in persons who stutter.Twelve moderate to severe developmental stutterers were compared with a group of fluent speakers, matched for age and sex, on a range of computerized sensory-motor tasks. These tasks covered various aspects of visuomotor function - ballistic movement, dynamic steadiness, and several types of tracking - and visuoperceptual function - acuity, static perception, and dynamic perception. A novel technique was used to remove the visuospatial component from tracking performance. Stutterers had slower reaction times, less accurate random tracking, and impaired dynamic visual perception. Severity of stuttering correlated with reaction time and dynamic perception. Removal of the visuoperceptual component from tracking performance indicated that the impaired tracking in the stutterers was predominantly due to reduced dynamic perception.This is the first study to provide preliminary evidence for the presence of non-linguistic visuoperceptual and upper-limb visuomotor tracking deficits in people with moderate to severe stuttering. These findings support a neurogenic aetiology for stuttering and are compatible with evidence of an overactive dopamine system in stutterers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Visuospatial working memory in adolescents with poor performance in mathematics: variation depending on reading skills
PY  - 2008
AB  - The first purpose of this study was to investigate whether the visuospatial working memory (VSWM) skills of 15-16-year-old pupils with difficulties in mathematics differ from those of their normally achieving peers. The goal was to broaden the view of the complex system of VSWM. A set of passive and active VSWM tasks was used. The study's second purpose was to investigate whether pupils with mathematical difficulties differed in their VSWM skills based on whether they had signs of reading deficits or not. Results indicate that the pupils with poor performance in maths showed poorer performance on certain VSWM tasks. The group with deficits only in maths had less capacity for storing passive visual simultaneous information, while the group with difficulties both in maths and reading had deficits in both storing (passive visual and visuospatial information) and processing, and had less ability to control irrelevant visuospatial information compared to their peers of the same age. The results indicate a general VSWM deficit in pupils with both mathematics and reading problems and a specific VSWM deficit in pupils with only mathematics problems.

TI  - Visuospatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia
PY  - 1997
AB  - Recent investigations have documented abnormalities in working memory related processes in schizophrenics on tasks assessing the central executive component of this cognitive model. This preliminary study investigated the function of another component of the working memory system, the visuospatial scratch pad in schizophrenia. The ''scratch pad's'' passive visual store-responsible for the temporary retention of visual material-was assessed via a computerized spatial delayed response task, whereas its active spatial rehearsal subsystem-specialized for retaining the temporal properties-was explored through visual block span, To assess elemental visual spatial abilities we used the Judgment of Line Orientation test. Thirty-two schizophrenics and 27 controls were tested. Although we discovered the basic perceptual abilities of patients to be intact, we determined that whenever memory was necessitated on spatial tasks, patients demonstrated marked deficits. This pattern of cognitive dysfunction is consistent with impairments in a neural network involving prefrontal and/or posterior brain regions in schizophrenia.

PY  - 2016
AB  - We combined a few methods to effectively create the illusion of embodiment and sense of body motion in the framework of the rubber hand illusion. In our experiments, active hand movements and self-stimulation were employed instead of classical passive tactile stimuli applied to still hands. The combination of these conditions effectively created the illusion. Furthermore, we collectively tested the effects of visual stimuli that were accompanied with tactile sensations. Specifically, we observed that when an object associated with tactile sensations was moving around the fake hand, the illusion tended to be more intensively induced than when an object that was unlikely to be associated with tactile sensations was placed still near the fake hand.

TI  - Vital Electronics, the key to the developing dynamic GIS for the Baltic or other maritime environments
PY  - 2010
AB  - Dynamic GIS can provide geospatial information in real-time in support of first responses to natural disasters (e.g. flooding on the Baltic ecosystem), man-made disasters (e.g. oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico), and for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. All these scenarios require the integration between the real time data acquisition and dynamic GIS. The proposed Vital Electronic System for Maritime Applications (SYSTEM) integrates: a land or sea-based Data Center; a "Mother Ship" (used for sensor deployment and local data collection); and a large number of easily deployed, disposable, intercommunicating, and intelligent "Floaters" (equipped with task-specific sensors). An embedded Vital Electronics Computer composed of a hierarchical network of a large number of wireless PSoC-based GNODEs (configurable at deployment), forms the core of SYSTEM. The Floaters include both task-specific Sensing-only GNODEs and Aggregation GNODEs dedicated to local data aggregation and global communications tasks. Sensing GNODE may be equipped with submerged sensors (e.g. water temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, passive acoustic, SONAR), and/or above water sensors (e.g. air temperature, proximity, sound, light, thermal IR, passive RF, RADAR). Aggregation GNODEs provide absolute location (e.g. GPS or other means) and also long-range communications with the "Mother Ship", a satellite or airborne platform, and/or a land-based data center. Ultimately, the data collected by the system can be integrated with reference GIS data (such as existing terrain and sea-bottom maps, as well as other live information. The composite data should be web-accessible with the appropriate level of security to relevant agencies and other authorized users. Currently, breadboard proto-prototype Floater electronics is under development.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Introduction: Spastic paresis if a frequent symptom ofcerebral vascular event as well as other kinds of acquiredbrain damage. It is a sensorimotor complication, which isincreasingly discussed in the field of neurorehabilitation. In connection with these problems and present trends ofmodern time, increasingly novel robotic systems, whichare components of ergotherapy intervention, come tothe rehabilitation technique market. Functional electricstimulation employs the deep penetration of the electricsignal to relevant nervous filaments which mediatescontractions of the required muscular groups of upperextremity including fingers and wrist. Due to the highamplitude of electric signal, which is used by functionalelectric stimulation, there are multiple repetitive move-ments of the hand, which contribute to sensorimotorrestoration of the paretic extremity. Functional neuromuscularelectric stimulation can make it easier to return tooriginal functional abilities of the patient and to performindependent activities of daily living.Methodology: the objective of the study was to evaluateeffects of the system Ness H200, which uses electricstimulation on the motor and functional abilities of theparetic upper extremity after cerebral vascular event(8 to 36 months since the event). The preclinical studymonitors immediate effect of functional electric stimulation(FES) on the increase of active range of the wristdorsal flexion in six cases for the period of three weeksby means of goniometric measurement, always beforeand after the treatment (60 observations in 6 patients).Moreover, it monitors improving functional performanceof the paretic extremity in the final examinationcompared with the entry examination by an objectivestandardized method of the Modified Frenchay scale.Ergotherapeutic intervention by means of Ness H200was performed for 5 days a week, 3 weeks for the periodof 30min with the use of the neuromodulation programevoking repetitive passive movements and a functionalprogram stimulating the hand grip function.Hypotheses: "Functional electric stimulation produces animmediate effect on the increase of active range of the wrist dorsal flexion movements in patient after cerebralvascular event"."In patients having been applied functional electric stimulationof the paretic upper extremity there is an improvementof Modified Frenchay scale in the final examinationas compared with the entry examination".Results: According to goniometric examination, FESsignificantly influences immediate increase of activerange of the hand wrist flexion at the 5% level of significance(P=0.043). The mean improvement represented9.64°, which is an improvement of 0.08 in the 95% intervalestimate improvement. The results of the ModifiedFrenchay scale were not significant at the 5% level ofsignificance. (P=0.06).Conclusion: Functional electric stimulation is a newtherapeutic procedure, which significantly improves thegrip function of acral paretic upper extremity in patientsafter cerebral vascular event. This study revealed that it isa suitable therapeutic procedure, which can be employedby ergotherapy specialists in their practice.

TI  - Vocalization characteristics of North Atlantic right whale surface active groups in the calving habitat, southeastern United States
PY  - 2013
AB  - Passive acoustic surveys were conducted to assess the vocal behavior of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the designated critical calving habitat along the shallow coastal waters of southeastern United States. Underwater vocalizations were recorded using autonomous buoys deployed in close proximity to surface active groups (SAGs). Nine main vocalization types were identified with manual inspection of spectrograms, and standard acoustic descriptors were extracted. Classification trees were used to examine the distinguishing characteristics of calls and quantify their variability within the SAG vocal repertoire. The results show that descriptors of frequency, bandwidth, and spectral disorder are the most important parameters for partitioning the SAG repertoire, contrary to duration-related measures. The reported source levels and vocalization statistics provide sound production data vital to inform regional passive acoustic monitoring and conservation for this endangered species.

TI  - Vocalization-Induced Enhancement of the Auditory Cortex
PY  - 2009
AB  - Objective—The present study investigated whether self-vocalization enhances auditory neural responsiveness to voice pitch feedback perturbation and how this vocalization-induced neural modulation can be affected by the extent of the feedback deviation. Method—Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 15 subjects in response to +100, +200 and +500 cents pitch-shifted voice auditory feedback during active vocalization and passive listening to the playback of the self-produced vocalizations. Result—The amplitude of the evoked P1 (latency: 73.51 ms) and P2 (latency: 199.55 ms) ERP components in response to feedback perturbation were significantly larger during vocalization than listening. The difference between P2 peak amplitudes during vocalization vs. listening was shown to be significantly larger for +100 than +500 cents stimulus. Conclusion—Results indicate that the human auditory cortex is more responsive to voice F0 feedback perturbations during vocalization than passive listening. Greater vocalization-induced enhancement of the auditory responsiveness to smaller feedback perturbations may imply that the audio-vocal system detects and corrects for errors in vocal production that closely match the expected vocal output. Significance—Findings of this study support previous suggestions regarding the enhanced auditory sensitivity to feedback alterations during self-vocalization, which may serve the purpose of feedback-based monitoring of one’s voice.

TI  - Volatilization behaviour of gasoline from unsaturated clay soil
PY  - 1997
AB  - Gasoline behaviour in clay soil is important in both passive and active soil remediation systems. In the case of heterogenic soil sites, soil vapour extraction (SVE) can be limited by the passive movement within clay lenses. Quantifying passive volatilization rates of gasoline in clay soil at differing water contents is thus of great importance to SVE. Laboratory soil column experiments were conducted to determine passive volatilization behaviour from a clay soil. A 10-component synthetic gasoline was formulated to approximate the chemical composition of gasoline. Gasoline components were monitored on a total and individual basis at 11 different depths in the soil and at 8 different times. An air-dry clay soil exhibited approximately the same volatilization behaviour as an air-dry loamy sand. Tracking individual components and total gasoline demonstrated that both soil-air diffusion and immiscible phase wicking contributed to the volatilization process. Immiscible phase wicking was severely dampened as the soil's water content increased. It was not possible to resolve whether the soil-air diffusion mechanism was dependent on water content due to noise in the experimental results. These results are of importance to any SVE operation that is being used in a soil which contains clay lenses.

TI  - Volition following hemiplegia
PY  - 1980
AB  - Following a minimum period of 11 weeks after cerebrovascular accident and resulting hemiplegia, 100 adult patients were assessed, over a period of 3 years, for sensory-motor deficits affecting the function of the paralyzed upper extremity. This paper presents only the assessment of voluntary control, the disturbances of voluntary motion, and the interrelationship between the components of voluntary motion and other clinical manifestations. Kendall rank order correlations were computed for this purpose. In the voluntary control of the gross arm motions, forearm supination and spontaneity of arm usage appeared to be most significant in predicting the presence of other synergistic components. The isolated muscle function revealed during execution of functional tasks showed the ability to grasp an object as the least affected task and dropping a coin in a slot as the most difficult. Inability to perform voluntary motion was primarily related to the limitation of active and passive motion of the shoulders, elbow, wrist, and hand.

TI  - Volitional intention and proprioceptive feedback in healthy and stroke subjects
PY  - 2014
AB  - Increasing somatosensory input and concurrent volitional intention can enhance functionally relevant brain reorganization after stroke and is a potential mechanism of action of functional electrical stimulation (FES). Here we used fMRI to investigate this interaction in the brain during FES. FES is used as a method to augment proprioception during an active motor task. 17 controls and 11 chronic post-stroke patients were scanned during four conditions in a 2×2 factorial design: (1 & 2) repetitive unilateral active (moved by the subject) ankle dorsiflexion with and without concurrent electrical stimulation, (3 & 4) repetitive passive (moved by the experimenter) ankle dorsiflexion with and without concurrent electrical stimulation. In controls, all conditions elicited activity in regions known to be part of ankle motor control network. FES had an additional effect in primary sensorimotor areas (i.e. primary motor cortex - M1, primary somatosensory cortex - S1) during active compared to passive movement. In patients, all conditions elicited activity in a more widely distributed network, that included S1 and M 1. In particular, FES had a greater effect during active compared to passive movement in secondary areas (i.e. ipsilesional postcentral and angular gyrus). Angular gyrus is a recipient of proprioceptive information encoded in the postcentral gyrus. These results suggest that the interaction takes place in a more widely distributed network of brain areas after stroke, and that patients may take advantage of secondary areas to support motor learning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

TI  - Voltage- and Calcium-Dependent Motility of Saccular Hair Bundles
PY  - 2015
AB  - Active bundle motility, which is hypothesized to supply feedback for mechanical amplification of signals, is thought to enhance sensitivity and sharpen tuning in vestibular and auditory organs. To study active hair bundle motility, we combined high-speed camera recordings of bullfrog sacculi, which were mounted in a two-compartment chamber, and voltage-clamp of the hair cell membrane potential. Using this paradigm, we measured three types of bundle motions: 1) spontaneous oscillations which can be analyzed to measure the physiological operating range of the transduction channel; 2) a sustained quasi-static movement of the bundle that depends on membrane potential; and 3) a fast, transient and asymmetric movement that resets the bundle position and depends on changes in the membrane potential. These data support a role for both calcium and voltage in the transduction-channel function.

TI  - Voltage-controlled membrane-type active acoustic metasurfaces with ultrathin thickness
PY  - 2019
AB  - We propose an ultrathin membrane-type active acoustic metasurfaces with deep-subwavelength thickness for arbitrarily steering the transmitted acoustic wavefront in real-time via adjustment of the static voltage distribution. The underlying mechanism is that the change of tension on the middle membrane by the stresses introduced by the voltage exerted on the piezoelectric layers modulates the surface phase profile. The performance of the resulting device is numerically demonstrated via versatile wave-steering phenomena. Our design with functionality and flexibility opens up possibility for the design of active acoustic functional devices and may find important application in diverse fields such as acoustic communication.

TI  - Vowel Acoustics in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis: Comparison of Clear, Loud, and Slow Speaking Conditions
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose: The impact of clear speech, increased vocal intensity, and rate reduction on acoustic characteristics of vowels was compared in speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD), speakers with multiple sclerosis (MS), and healthy controls.Method: Speakers read sentences in habitual, clear, loud, and slow conditions. Variations in clarity, intensity, and rate were stimulated using magnitude production. Formant frequency values for peripheral and nonperipheral vowels were obtained at 20%, 50%, and 80% of vowel duration to derive static and dynamic acoustic measures. Intensity and duration measures were obtained.Results: Rate was maximally reduced in the slow condition, and vocal intensity was maximized in the loud condition. The clear condition also yielded a reduced articulatory rate and increased intensity, although less than for the slow or loud conditions. Overall, the clear condition had the most consistent impact on vowel spectral characteristics. Spectral and temporal distinctiveness for peripheral-nonperipheral vowel pairs was largely similar across conditions.Conclusions: Clear speech maximized peripheral and nonperipheral vowel space areas for speakers with PD and MS while also reducing rate and increasing vocal intensity. These results suggest that a speech style focused on increasing articulatory amplitude yields the most robust changes in vowel segmental articulation.

TI  - WHEN ARE VISION AND KINAESTHESIS COMPARABLE?
PY  - 1973
AB  - It has been frequently found that cross‐modal matching between vision and kinaesthesis is asymmetric such that the kinaesthetic—visual matching is more accurate than the reverse condition (e.g. Connolly & Jones, 1970; Millar, 1972). The present article points out that vision and ‘kinaesthesis’ should not always be regarded as equivalent sensory channels. It is shown that if kinaesthesis is taken as passive movement (the subject's relaxed arm was moved by the experimenter) then the passive movement matching of a visual standard corresponds very well to the reverse condition. However, matching a visual standard with a voluntary excursion of the limb (active movement) differs from the other two conditions both in absolute accuracy and in proportion of undershooting to overshooting. It is argued that some operations usually regarded as kinaesthetic depend only upon central monitoring of efference while others which can also be called kinaesthetic are based upon peripheral feedback. Some implications for cross‐modal matching of shapes and for theories of visualkinaesthetic memory are briefly discussed. 1973 The British Psychological Society

TI  - WHY DO PARALLEL CORTICAL SYSTEMS EXIST FOR THE PERCEPTION OF STATIC FORM AND MOVING FORM
PY  - 1991
AB  - This article analyzes computational properties that clarify why the parallel cortical systems V1 --> V2, V1 --> MT, and V1 --> V2 --> MT exist for the perceptual processing of static visual forms and moving visual forms. The article describes a symmetry principle, called FM symmetry, that is predicted to govern the development of these parallel cortical systems by computing all possible ways of symmetrically gating sustained cells with transient cells and organizing these sustained-transient cells into opponent pairs of no-cells and off-cells whose output signals are insensitive to direction of contrast. This symmetric organization explains how the static form system (static BCS) generates emergent boundary segmentations whose outputs are insensitive to direction of contrast and insensitive to direction of motion, whereas the motion form system (motion BCS) generates emergent boundary segmentations whose outputs are insensitive to direction of contrast but sensitive to direction of motion. FM symmetry clarifies why the geometries of static and motion form perception differ-for example, why the opposite orientation of vertical is horizontal (90-degrees), but the opposite direction of up is down (180-degrees). Opposite orientations and directions are embedded in gated dipole opponent processes that are capable of antagonistic rebound. Negative afterimages, such as the MacKay and waterfall illusions, are hereby explained as are aftereffects of long-range apparent motion. These antagonistic rebounds help to control a dynamic balance between complementary perceptual states of resonance and reset. Resonance cooperatively links features into emergent boundary segmentations via positive feedback in a CC loop, and reset terminates a resonance when the image changes, thereby preventing massive smearing of percepts. These complementary preattentive states of resonance and reset are related to analogous states that govern attentive feature integration, learning, and memory search in adaptive resonance theory. The mechanism used in the V1 --> MT system to generate a wave of apparent motion between discrete flashes may also be used in other cortical systems to generate spatial shifts of attention. The theroy suggests how the V1--> V2-->MT cortical stream helps to compute moving form in depth and how long-range apparent motion of illusory contours occurs. These results collectively argue against vision theories that espouse independent processing modules. Instead, specialized subsystems interact to overcome computational uncertainties and complementary deficiencies, to cooperatively bind features into context-sensitive resonances, and to realize symmetry principles that are predicted to govern the development of the visual cortex.

TI  - WII-BASED MOVEMENT THERAPY TO PROMOTE IMPROVED UPPER EXTREMITY FUNCTION POST-STROKE: A PILOT STUDY
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Virtual-reality is increasingly used to improve rehabilitation outcomes. The Nintendo Wii offers an inexpensive alternative to more complex systems.Objective: To investigate the efficacy of Wii-based therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation.Methods: Seven patients (5 men, 2 women, aged 42-83 years; 1-38 months post-stroke, mean 15.3 months) and 5 healthy controls (3 men, 2 women, aged 41-71 years) undertook 1 h of therapy on 10 consecutive weekdays. Patients progressively increased home practice to 3 h per day.Results: Functional ability improved for every patient. The mean performance time significantly decreased per Wolf Motor Function Test task, from 3.2 to 2.8 s, and Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores increased from 42.3 to 47.3. Upper extremity range-of-motion increased by 20.1 and 14.33 for passive and active movements, respectively. Mean Motor Activity Log (Quality of Movement scale) scores increased from 63.2 to 87.5, reflecting a transfer of functional recovery to everyday activities. Balance and dexterity did not improve significantly. No significant change was seen in any of these measures for healthy controls, despite improved skill levels for Wii games.Conclusion: An intensive 2-week protocol resulted in significant and clinically relevant improvements in functional motor ability post-stroke. These gains translated to improvement in activities of daily living.

AB  - Locomotion generates a visual movement pattern characterized as optic flow. To explore how the locomotor adjustments are affected by this pattern, an experimental paradigm was developed to eliminate optic flow during obstacle avoidance. The aim was to investigate the contribution of optic flow in obstacle avoidance by using a stroboscopic lamp. Ten young adults walked on an 8m pathway and stepped over obstacles at two heights. Visual sampling was determined by a stroboscopic lamp (static and dynamic visual sampling). Three-dimensional kinematics data showed that the visual information about self-motion provided by the optic flow was crucial for estimating the distance from and the height of the obstacle. Participants presented conservative behavior for obstacle avoidance under experimental visual sampling conditions, which suggests that optic flow favors the coupling of vision to adaptive behavior for obstacle avoidance.

PY  - 1995
AB  - Objectives-The main objective of this study was to investigate exposure-response relations between adverse musculoskeletal outcomes and ergonomic exposure variables.Methods-A cross sectional analytical study was conducted in 11 factories from seven sectors of manufacturing industry in South Africa. Exposure to workplace ergonomic stressors was assessed in factory floor jobs (n = 46) with a simple low technology observational model. Repetition, force, static posture, dynamic movement, and other job exposures were measured. Data of adverse musculoskeletal outcome and data on potential confounders and effect modifiers were obtained from subjects (n = 401) randomly sampled from each job category with a questionnaire given by interviewers.Results-High prevalences of regional musculoskeletal pain were found with substantial variability between industries. Sex was the only individual risk factor (after adjustment for potential confounders and effect modifiers) that was significantly associated with regional pain. Ergonomic exposures in the workplace were significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain of the neck and shoulders odds ratio (OR) 5.38 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.16 to 25.0) for repetition, and OR 3.91 (95% CI 1.11 to 13.7) for seated compared with standing work; pain of the wrists and hands OR 10.2 (95% CI 1.39 to 75.6) for high summed score of dynamic postures of the wrist).Conclusions-This study indicates good predictive ability to reduce ergonomic stress with the exposure model, simple surveillance methods, and educational programmes in the workplace. Further study on sampling strategies and refinement of dimensions of ergonomic stressors are needed.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the size distribution of young firms within some selected industries, trying to assess the empirical implications of different models of industry dynamics: the model of passive learning (Jovanovic 1982), the model of active learning (Ericson and Pakes, 1995), and the evolutionary model (Audretsch, 1995). We use a non-parametric technique, the Kernel density estimator, applied to a data set from the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS), consisting in 12 cohorts of new manufacturing firms followed for 6 years. Since the patterns of convergence to the limit distribution are different between industries, we conclude that the model of passive learning is consistent with some of them, the active exploration model with others, the evolutionary model with all of them.

TI  - WRIST POSITION AND EXTENSOR TENDON AMPLITUDE FOLLOWING REPAIR
PY  - 1992
AB  - After primary repair of severed extensor tendons, various methods are used to limit tendon adhesions and avoid rupture. Early passive digital motion with wrist extension (a "reverse Kleinert" protocol) has been advocated. However, there are no data to support an optimum wrist position or to indicate how much finger motion may safely be permitted. In this study we used eight fresh cadaver limbs to measure extensor tendon gliding in Verdan's zones 3 to 8 when active grip and passive extension were simulated at different wrist positions. We found that if the wrist is extended more than 21 degrees, the extensor tendon glides with little or no tension in zones 5 and 6 throughout full simulated grip to full passive extension, permitting "passive motion" exercises to minimize tendon adhesions without risking rupture. In addition, we found that up to 6.4 mm of tendon can be debrided safely and full grip can still be permitted post-operatively if the wrist is splinted at 45 degrees extension.

TI  - WTC in EMI: Correlational Factors and College Learners’ Perceptions
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper investigates the differences in college learners’ perceptionsand correlations of factors related to willingness to communicate(WTC) in an English mediated instruction (EMI) class. Based on asurvey of 50 collegiates (33 males, 17 females) and two rounds ofinterviews with 15 students, the t-tests showed that there were notmany statistical differences depending on learner characteristics exceptthe learners’ grade difference affecting their perception of improvementin English. However, depending on the course types, theKruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences in thecategories of present level of participation, expected level ofparticipation with L1 option, question & answer, group collaboration,active listening, and preference to EMI with L1 option. Furthermore,the factors of WTC appeared strongly correlated with their perceptionson the improvement in English, increased confidence, and the extent oflearning in the EMI class. According to qualitative analyses ofopen-ended questions in the survey and interviews, the learnersthought group presentations in English were most difficult. They alsoresponded that their low English proficiency, peer pressure, and thestudent-orientedness in class made them passive and less confident.The learners, however, adopted diverse coping strategies to overcome such difficulties. They were also positive about the limited use of L1in the EMI class. Implications for EMI are suggested.

TI  - Walking Phase Modulates H-Reflex Amplitude in Flexor Carpi Radialis
PY  - 2014
AB  - It is well established that remote whole-limb rhythmic movement (e.g., cycling or stepping) induces suppression of the Hoffman (H-) reflex evoked in stationary limbs. However, the dependence of reflex amplitude on the phase of the movement cycle (i.e., phase-dependence) has not been consistent across this previous research. The authors investigated the phase-dependence of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex amplitudes during active walking and in kinematically matched static postures across the gait cycle. FCR H-reflexes were elicited in the stationary forearm with electrical stimulation to the median nerve. Significant phase-dependent modulation occurred during walking when the gait cycle was examined with adequate phase resolution. The suppression was greatest during midstance and midswing, suggesting increased ascending communication during these phases. There was no phase-dependent modulation in static standing postures and no correlation between lower limb background electromyography levels and H-reflex amplitude during active walking. This evidence, along with previous research demonstrating no phase modulation during passive walking, suggests that afferent feedback associated with joint position and leg muscle activation levels are not the sole source of the phase modulation seen during active walking. Possible sources of phase modulation include combinations of afferent feedback related to active movement or central motor commands or both.

TI  - Walking mechanism of 3D passive dynamic motion with lateral rolling
PY  - 2007
AB  - The simulation analysis of 3D passive dynamic walking was performed in order to determine structural parameters for stable walking. As the first stage to this analysis, the yaw motion was assumed to be small enough to ignore. The limit cycles were observed in both lateral and sagittal plane under certain conditions. Then, a 3D passive walker was built for experimental analyses. The one of the best conditions for stable walking from simulation was applied for experiments. 3D passive walker walked down the slope although there were some differences between simulation and experiments.

TI  - Walking through an aperture with visual information obtained at a distance
PY  - 2017
AB  - The present study addressed whether visual information about the width of an aperture, obtained at a distance, would be sufficient to guide walking through the aperture without collision. For this purpose, we asked twelve young participants to walk while holding a 66-cm horizontal bar (bar length needs to be considered in order to perceive space necessary for crossing) and pass through an aperture without vision from 3 m in front of the aperture. Participants performed the tasks under each of four visual conditions, which differed in how vision was available: observation for 1.5 s while standing (static vision), observation during two forward steps and stopping (dynamic vision), observation during two forward steps and not stopping (dynamic vision with nonstop walking), and full vision. The results showed that, for narrow apertures (the widths were 0.8 and 1.0 times the bar length), the rate of collision without vision was about 40-50 %. This was mainly due to the maladaptive planning of body rotation. For the aperture 1.0 times the bar length, the percentage of trials with no body rotation was high, suggesting that at least some participants underestimated the space necessary for crossing. The location at which maximum body rotation occurred became farther from the obstacle, which may have been related to decreased movement speed. The availability of dynamic visual sampling during two forward steps did not contribute to improving collision avoidance. These results suggest that, while fundamental locomotor patterns are maintained even without online vision, both the underestimation of space required for crossing and the lack of fine-tuning of behavior prior to crossing increased collision rates.

AB  - Proprioception is important in maintaining shoulder joint stability.\nPrevious studies investigated the effects of unconstrained multiplanar\nmotion, with subjects able to move freely in space, on repositioning\ntasks for active shoulder motion but not passive motion. We sought to\nfurther explore joint position sense with 3D passive, robot-guided\nmotions. We hypothesized that target repositioning error would be\ngreater in the case of passively placed targets than for actively placed\ntargets. To investigate, 15 healthy individuals participated (8 female,\n7 male), who were at most 6?ft (183?cm) tall to accommodate the\nequipment, and who had no history of shoulder injury, surgery, or\nsignificant participation in throwing sports. Target orientations were\ncentered at 44 degrees of elevation and 32 degrees of horizontal\nrotation from the frontal plane. Two sets of 10 trials were performed.\nThe first set involved active placement followed by active replacement,\nand the second set involved passive, robot-guided, placement followed by\nactive replacement.

TI  - Watching social interactions produces dorsomedial prefrontal and medial parietal BOLD fMRI signal increases compared to a resting baseline
PY  - 2004
AB  - Some human brain areas are tonically active in a resting state when subjects are not engaged in any overt task. The activity of these areas decreases when subjects are engaged in a wide variety of laboratory tasks designed to study cognitive operations. It has been suggested that these areas, among them the medial parietal and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, may support a "default state" of the human brain. Passive visual observation of laboratory stimuli typically yields no change in activity in these default areas compared to rest. Here we report functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on normal subjects watching realistic movie clips depicting everyday social interactions. In contrast with previous findings on default state brain areas, the observation of the relational segment of the movie clip, during which two persons interact, yielded increased activity in the medial parietal (precuneus) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, compared to rest and to observation of the segment of the movie clip depicting a single individual engaged in everyday activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of joint increased activity in medial parietal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. We suggest that the default state areas may participate in the processing of social relations in concert with regions previously identified as critical for social cognition that were also activated by our stimuli, including the inferior frontal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, and the fusiform gyrus.

TI  - Water and nutrient dynamics in surface roots and soils are not modified by short-term flooding of phreatophytic plants in a hyperarid desert
PY  - 2006
AB  - Little is known of the mechanisms employed by woody plants to acquire key resources such as water and nutrients in hyperarid environments. For phreatophytic plants, deep roots are necessary to access the water table, but given that most nutrients in many desert ecosystems are stored in the upper soil layers, viable shallow roots may be equally necessary for nutrient uptake. We sought to better understand the interaction between water and nutrient uptake from soil horizons differing in the relative abundance of these resources. To this end, we monitored plant water and nutrient status before and after applying flood irrigation to four phreatophytic perennial plant species in the remote hyperarid Taklamakan desert in western China. Sap flow in the roots of five plants of the perennial desert species Alhagi sparsifolia Shap., Karelina caspica (Pall.) Less., Calligonum caput medusea Schrenk, and Eleagnus angustifolia Hill. was monitored using the heat ratio method (HRM). Additionally we measured predawn and midday water potential, foliar nitrate reductase activity (NRA), xylem sap nutrient concentration and the concentration of total solutes in the leaves before, 12 and 96 h after flooding to investigate possible short-term physiological effects on water and nutrient status. Rates of sap flow measured during the day and at night in the absence of transpiration did not change after flooding. Moderately high rates of sap flow (HRM heat pulse velocity, 5-25 cm h(-1)) detected during the day in soils that had a near zero water content at the surface indicated that all species had contact to groundwater. There was no evidence from sap flow data that plants had utilised flood water to increase maximum rates of transpiration under similar climatic conditions, and there was no evidence of a process to improve the efficiency of water or nutrient uptake, such as hydraulic redistribution (i.e. the passive movement of water from moist soil to very dry soil via roots). Measurements of plant water status, xylem sap nutrient status, foliar NRA and the concentration of osmotically active substances were also unaffected by flood irrigation. Our results clearly show that groundwater acts as the major source of water and nutrients for these plants. The inability of plants to utilise abundant surface soil-water or newly available nutrients following irrigation was attributed to the absence of fine roots in the topsoil layer.

TI  - Wave-conversion active liner based on generalized snell-Descartes law
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Cremer's impedance theoretical framework has been used for years to optimally design acoustic liners for the aeronautic industry, such as honeycomb liners. This passive mean of sound absorption, which consists in rather thin (a few centimeters) honeycomb-shaped cavities glued between a perforated sheet and a rigid back-wall, has several downsides: an optimal acoustic absorption can only be achieved over a limited bandwidth, centered around one (eventually two) prescribed central frequency. Their performance at low frequencies is also limited by their size, owing to the "quarter-wavelength rule". In this paper, we propose a fully tunable active liner based on electrodynamic resonators, employing loudspeaker membranes as sound absorbers, and an active control framework allowing modifying their acoustic impedance over a wide frequency band. An optimization of these active absorbers is achieved by considering the theoretical framework of the generalized Snell-Descartes law, which accounts for impedance gratings over an interface. Through this formalism, it is possible to devise a wave conversion strategy within an active acoustic liner in order to absorb multimodal sound propagation inside a rigid duct, improving the noise attenuation performance of the liner over an extended bandwidth © Proceedings of the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2019.

TI  - Wavelet-Based Dynamic Evaluation of Human Equilibrium Function under Passive Motion
PY  - 2014
AB  - The efficient evaluation of human equilibrium function is important for people with organs degradation and dysfunction. The traditional evaluation of static and dynamic equilibrium function seems efficient, but the prepared participants restricted the experimental results to be objective and genuine. For evaluating the equilibrium function efficiently, the authors propose a wavelet-based dynamic model of the human body using external excitation. Firstly, they introduce a local linearization method based on the second-order Taylor expansion for simplifying typical linear system model. Secondly, the continuous wavelet transform analysis is applied to process gravity-center data and estimate parameters of the dynamic model. Finally, the settled time of the systemic responding rapidity is evaluated. Furthermore, the index of the equilibrium ability is obtained. The experiment results show the validity and practicability of the proposed method.

AB  - The human-robot physical interaction systems (HRpI), are plat-forms designed for the transmission of knowledge, from contact between a human kinesthetic, and a robotic device with inertial dynamic and tribological low. The dynamic of contact for the robotic system is modified to the inertial, gravitational forces and tribology (friction and mechanical vibrations); that represent uncertainty in the cooperative scheme the human operator responds differently in different experimental events. The robot control strategies are remarkably insufficient stabilization clas-sical systems (conventional PID control), or nonlinear robust controls where no significant changes in the control gains based on the dynamic of interaction.

TI  - Wearable Haptic Interface Using ICPF Actuators for Tactile Feel Display in Response to Hand Movements
PY  - 2003
AB  - In order to display delicate touch feeling of surface of some materials, active touch of human hand movements should be considered. In this paper, a wearable stimulation device which can produce various distributed stimuli on human skin in response to hand movements was developed using ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer gel Film) actuators. Characteristics of touch feeling of roughness were measured using vibratory stimulation. The results showed that the threshold amplitude under active touch were smaller than under passive touch. A stimulation method which generates selective stimuli to sense receptors in accordance with velocities and accelerations of hand motions was proposed. It was confirmed experimentally that some kinds of pattern of driving waves express touch feelings such as starting, stopping and sliding feel of hand motions.

TI  - Wearable Visual Robots
PY  - 2002
AB  - Research work reported in the literature in wearable visual computing has used exclusively static (or non-active) cameras, making the imagery and image measurements dependent on the wearer's posture and motions. It is assumed that the camera is pointing in a good direction to view relevant parts of the scene at best by virtue of being mounted on the wearer's head, or at worst wholly by chance. Even when pointing in roughly the correct direction, any visual processing relying on feature correspondence from a passive camera is made more difficult by the large, uncontrolled inter-image movements which occur when the wearer moves, or even breathes. This paper presents a wearable active visual sensor which is able to achieve a level of decoupling of camera movement from the wearer's posture and motions by a combination of inertial and visual sensor feedback and active control. The issues of sensor placement, robot kinematics and their relation to wearability are discussed. The performance of the prototype robot is evaluated for some essential visual tasks. The paper also discusses potential applications for this kind of wearable robot.

TI  - Web service composition based on Petri Nets: Review and contribution
PY  - 2013
AB  - Web Services (WSs) are the most used implementation of service-oriented architectures allowing the construction and the sharing of independent and autonomous software. WS composition consists in combining several WSs into a Composite one, which becomes a value-added service, in order to satisfy complex users queries. Thus, the WS composition process may imply several phases to identify how and which WSs will conform the Composite WS, including specification, verification, evaluation, WSs selection, and execution. As it is known, Petri Nets are the main formal models used to describe static vision of a system and dynamic behavior of processes. Then, Petri Nets are well suited to model internal operations of WSs and interactions among them as well as to model the processes in all phases of the WS composition process. In this article we present a review of approaches using Petri Nets for WS composition. Moreover, we describe our experiences in this field: a transactional-QoS-driven WS selection approach and a framework for reliable execution of Composite WSs based on Colored Petri Nets. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

TI  - Wednesday, September 26, 2018 7:35 AM–9:00 AM ePosters: P122. Cervical interbody spacer with passive radiographic fusion status indicator.
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT Pseudarthrosis or nonunion of the cervical spine is the result of failed attempted fusion and is a leading cause of postoperative axial pain and radiculopathy. Reported rates of failed cervical fusion range from 4.4 to 50%, generally higher with multilevel procedures, and pseudarthrosis accounts for 45%–56% of revision surgeries. Nonunion is difficult to detect clinically and diagnosis is based solely on symptomatology (neck pain, radiculopathy) and imaging studies. The gold standard approach to define fusion status involves surgical exploration, a last resort option. Radiographic tools are commonly used first, with computed tomography (CT) considered the most reliable method. However, CT scans are expensive and expose patients to large radiation doses (hundreds of times more than standard X-ray). The status of anterior cervical fusion can also be determined using interspinous motion analysis; the goal is to detect any movement between adjacent vertebra using dynamic radiographs. This may be accomplished by measuring the distance between the tips of adjacent spinous processes on lateral flexion and extension films. However, the technique is subjective and affected by parallax, and studies have found wide interobserver differences. This makes it difficult to accurately apply the method to assess pseudarthrosis using the proposed cutoff values (1 or 2 mm). Other literature similarly suggests that current radiographic methods do not reliably provide clinical information about abnormalities of intervertebral motion. Therefore quantitative and standardized methods for defining spinal fusion or instability are needed. PURPOSE Our hypothesis is that intervertebral motion can be more accurately detected using a simple passive implantable device that responds to the pressure differential or vertebral body endplate motion within the index disc space between the flexed and extended positions of the cervical spine. Conceptually, this dynamic motion sensor could detect and potentially prevent pseudarthrosis, a leading cause of postoperative pain and radiculopathy STUDY DESIGN/SETTING This desktop and benchtop research was conducted primarily in a chemistry laboratory. Manufacturing of prototypes and other materials was performed on-site. Radiographic images were taken at a centralized animal research facility. METHODS A cervical interbody spacer with integrated fluidic pressure sensor was developed using CAD modeling software and prototyped with 3D printing. The working principal involves a fluid well and indicator channel. The spacer was placed between Sawbones vertebra analogs and loads applied to simulate dynamic spinal positions. Previous work with a similar fluidics device used a single-column compression tester to apply loads comparable to those experienced by vertebra in the cervical region. Radiographs were also taken of a device loaded with radio-dense fluid (cesium acetate) and channel diameter of 0.5mm. RESULTS Computer simulations suggested that the device would fit and function well between cervical vertebra in the flexed and extended spinal positions. Prototypes placed between cervical bone analogs under load demonstrated that the signal would be apparent clinically. Previous work showed that fluid displacement into the indicator portion was in the appropriate scale (0–6.9 mm) under applied loads in the range experienced clinically (0–110 N); this relationship was linear and repeatable. The imaging resolution of the device with a radiocontrast agent as the indicator fluid was also within the clinical range, and the signal was apparent on radiographs. CONCLUSIONS Based on these results it appears that an interbody device with fluidic sensor is potentially a viable option for assessing fusion status in the cervical spine.Prior literature gives the range of loads expected in the cervical spine (up to ≈100N). Articles describing interspinous motion analysis suggest sufficient bone growth (fusion) occurs when the distance between the tips of adjacent cervical spinous processes changes by less than 1 mm or 2 mm between flexion and extension. Our concept offers two primary advantages over existing techniques. First, the indicator channel provides a clear and distinct signal or marker that can be plainly read on radiographs, simplifying comparisons between the flexed, neutral and extended positions and enabling monitoring over time. Second, the device introduces gain proportional to the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the fluid well and channel, providing amplification and enabling detection of smaller changes. While a priori research demonstrated that an implantable fluidic device responded appropriately under the range of applied physiologic loads, if needed additional gain could be introduced by increasing this ratio. Future work involving finite element analysis and mechanical testing is underway and ultimately a cadaveric study will be conducted to verify the loads and characterize the device in vitro.Limitations of this work include the material choice as all prototypes were created using 3D printing. The flexural modulus of the material is important, and the device may potentially be formed with polycarbonate urethane, a stiffer and tougher flexible material commonly used in cervical disc replacements.

TI  - Weld Pool Image Segmentation of Hump Formation Based on Fuzzy C-Means and Chan-Vese Model
PY  - 2019
AB  - The geometric parameters of the weld pool can reflect welding quality, and thus, it can be important to detect the weld pool contour accurately and reliably. A passive vision system was designed to obtain the weld pool image of hump formation by an infrared transmitting filter, and a method of weld pool image segmentation strategy based on a Chan-Vese (CV) model with fuzzy C-means (FCM) is proposed. The FCM-CV algorithm uses an FCM model to set the initialization contour and then extracts the contour of the hump by the active contour CV model. FCM-CV algorithm eliminates the problem that the CV model is sensitive to the initial contour, and thus, the FCM-CV algorithm can extract the contours of the weld pool under different processing conditions. The contour of the hump is segmented, and the weld pool length feature is extracted. The results show that the truncation of the weld pool length is the main image feature reflecting the formation of the hump.

TI  - Weld Seam Detection Method Based on Passive Vision Sensor in Laser Welding
PY  - 2019
AB  - Vision sensor system based on structured light has been widely used for seam detection. However,there still exist preview distance between vision sensor and welding torch in general measurement system,which can inevitable cause seam detection errors.This paper proposed a passive vision sensor without preview distance to measure narrow butt joint. The weld pool is observed directly by vision sensor to avoid the error caused by preview distance. Meanwhile,only one point of the weld seam can be captured at a time,which makes the image processing vulnerable to light noise. So the high-dynamic-range camera is used and adjusted to a specific position to obtain image containing significant feature of weld seam. Accordingly,an image processing method based on improved Hough transform is proposed to extract the seam position. The search erea,search template and weight calculation method of Hough transform are optimized,so the method can guarantee the robustness and efficiency and accurately extract the seam position and track the slope and intercept of weld seam.

TI  - Weld recognition based on texture feature
PY  - 2008
AB  - An automatic recognition and welding seam-tracking visual method was proposed. Different from the active vision method using the macrostructure feature of the workpiece, the passive vision method the gray gradient of the workpiece image is used, It uses the obvious difference of texture feature between welding seam region and base metal region. It has advantage to solve the weld recognition in the multi-layer welding, which is diffcult for the usual visual method. In the method, the textural feature of the image was firstly analyzed, and then the image was segmented by the difference of the image texture feature between the weld region and the base metal region; finally, the zone of the weld were recognized, and its position and the center could be found. Experiment showed the proposed method was effective for welding seam recognition in multi-layer welding.

TI  - What Box: A task for assessing language lateralization in young children
PY  - 2018
AB  - The assessment of active language lateralization in infants and toddlers is challenging. It requires an imaging tool that is unintimidating, quick to setup, and robust to movement, in addition to an engaging and cognitively simple language processing task. Functional Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound (fTCD) offers a suitable technique and here we report on a suitable method to elicit active language production in young children. The 34-second What Box trial presents an animated face searching for an object. The face finds a box that opens to reveal a to-be-labelled object. In a sample of 95 children (1 to 5 years of age), 81% completed the task32% with 10 trials. The task was validated (=0.4) against the gold standard Word Generation task in a group of older adults (n=65, 60-85 years of age), though was less likely to categorize lateralization as left or right, indicative of greater measurement variability. Existing methods for active language production have been used with 2-year-old children while passive listening has been conducted with sleeping 6-month-olds. This is the first active method to be successfully employed with infants through to pre-schoolers, forming a useful tool for populations in which complex instructions are problematic.

TI  - What Can Neuromorphic Event-Driven Precise Timing Add to Spike-Based Pattern Recognition?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Recent literature in the robot learning community has focused on learning robot skills that abstract out lower-level details of robot control, such as Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), the options framework in hierarchical RL, and subtask policies. To fully leverage the efficacy of these macro actions, it is necessary to then sequence these primitives to achieve a given task. Our objective is to jointly learn a set of robot skills and a sequence of these learnt skills to accomplish a given task. We consider the task of navigating a robot across various environments using visual input, maximizing the distance traveled through the environment while avoiding static obstacles. Traditional planning methods to solve this problem rely on hand-crafted state representations and heuristics for planning, and often fail to generalize. In contrast, deep neural networks have proved to be powerful function approximators, successfully modeling complex control policies. In addition, the ability of such networks to learn good representations of high-dimensional sensory inputs makes them a valuable tool when dealing with visual inputs. In this project, we explore the capability of deep neural networks to learn and sequence robot skills for navigation, directly using visual input.

TI  - What Triggers an LBP Flare? A Content Analysis of Individuals' Perspectives
PY  - 2020
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For many, low back pain (LBP) is a lifelong condition with symptoms varying over time. Previous studies have investigated long-term risk factors and triggers for onset of LBP. No study has examined causes for less distinct fluctuations of symptoms, such as "flares," which individuals with LBP identify as a significant and worrisome part of LBP. As little is known about what triggers this type of fluctuation, we aimed to investigate individuals' perspectives on LBP flare triggers. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 130 people with LBP, asking what they think triggers their flares. Data were qualitatively examined using content analysis. RESULTS: Most participants identified biomedical (84.8%) triggers, endorsing physical/biological factors to explain the flare occurrence. Themes included active movements (35% of participants), static postures (28.1%), overdoing a task (5.3%), biomechanical dysfunction (4.4%), comorbidities (4%), lack of exercise (3.3%), work (1.8%), and medications (1.5%). Nonbiomedical triggers were reported by 15.2% and included psychosocial and contextual factors, including psychological state (6%), weather (5%), sleep (2%), diet (1.2%), and fatigue (1%). These results indicate that individuals consider biomedical factors to be the main triggers of LBP flares, but some acknowledge nonbiomedical triggers. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings contrast with current pain theories, which suggest that there is a need for a reduced emphasis on biomedical causes of LBP pain, especially when persistent. Recognition of patients' views on causes of LBP flares is crucial to better guide clinical practice and inform further research. The validity of triggers identified by LBP patients requires further investigation.

TI  - What are the basic dimensions of movements? A psychometric evaluation of the Comprehensive Body Examination III
PY  - 2001
AB  - Since it is argued that movements of the body are closely related to the inner life of a person, a range of active and passive body movements were examined in accordance with the Comprehensive Body Examination (CBE). The study assessed the psychometric dimensions of the CBE and its utility in giving more detailed information about the patient. Ss were 17 pain syndrome patients, 27 psychotic patients, and 4 non-psychotic patients and a comparison group of 51 students and staff members. On the basis of factor analysis, 3 CBE subscales were made: (1) Resistance to Passive Movements (RPM) with 9 items, (2) Assistance to Passive Movements with 6 items, and (3) Motor Disturbances (MD) with 3 items. The internal consistency of the subscales was high, and the intercorrelation low to moderate. The RPM subscale distinguished significantly between the staff and student group and the psychotic group. The MD subscale also distinguished between Ss taking drugs and those who did not, but there was no difference between Ss without medication and the staff and student group.

TI  - What do your footsteps sound like? An investigation on interactive footstep sounds adjustment
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper presents an experiment where participants were asked to adjust, while walking, the spectral content and the amplitude of synthetic footstep sounds in order to match the sounds of their own footsteps. The sounds were interactively generated by means of a shoe-based system capable of tracking footfalls and delivering real-time auditory feedback via headphones. Results allowed identification of the mean value and the range of variation of spectral centroid and peak level of footstep sounds simulating various combinations of shoe type and ground material. Results showed that the effect of ground material on centroid and peak level depended on the type of shoe. Similarly, the effect of shoe type on the two variables depended on the type of ground material. In particular, participants produced greater amplitudes for hard sole shoes than for soft sole shoes in presence of solid surfaces, while similar amplitudes for both types of shoes were found for aggregate, hybrids, and liquids. No significant correlations were found between each of the two acoustic features and participants' body size. This result might be explained by the fact that while adjusting the sounds participants did not primarily focus on the acoustic rendering of their body. In addition, no significant differences were found between the values of the two acoustic features selected by the experimenters and those adjusted by participants. This result can therefore be considered as a measure of the goodness of the design choices to synthesize the involved footstep sounds for a generic walker. More importantly, this study showed that the relationships between the ground-shoes combinations are not changed when participants are actively walking. This represents the first active listening confirmation of this result, which had previously only been shown in passive listening studies. The results of this research can be used to design ecologically-valid auditory rendering of foot-floor interactions in virtual environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - What has been missed for predicting human attention in viewing driving clips?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Recent research progress on the topic of human visual attention allocation in scene perception and its simulation is based mainly on studies with static images. However, natural vision requires us to extract visual information that constantly changes due to egocentric movements or dynamics of the world. It is unclear to what extent spatio-temporal regularity, an inherent regularity in dynamic vision, affects human gaze distribution and saliency computation in visual attention models. In this free-viewing eye-tracking study we manipulated the spatio-temporal regularity of traffic videos by presenting them in normal video sequence, reversed video sequence, normal frame sequence, and randomised frame sequence. The recorded human gaze allocation was then used as the 'ground truth' to examine the predictive ability of a number of state-of-the-art visual attention models. The analysis revealed high inter-observer agreement across individual human observers, but all the tested attention models performed significantly worse than humans. The inferior predictability of the models was evident from indistinguishable gaze prediction irrespective of stimuli presentation sequence, and weak central fixation bias. Our findings suggest that a realistic visual attention model for the processing of dynamic scenes should incorporate human visual sensitivity with spatio-temporal regularity and central fixation bias.

TI  - What is not working in working memory of children with literacy disorders? Evidence from a three-year-longitudinal study
PY  - 2014
AB  - The goals of this study were to explore the deficits in working memory associated with literacy disorders (i.e. developmental disorders of reading and/or spelling) and the developmental trajectories of these working memory deficits. The performance of 28 children with literacy disorders was compared to a non-disabled control group with the same group size at five bi-annual times of measurement in a three-year-longitudinal study beginning at the end of primary school (9.5 years of age). Storage capacity and central-executive working memory were assessed in phonological and visual-spatial modalities, the latter under static and dynamic conditions. Overall, children with literacy disorders were outperformed by their typical developing peers in all phonological and in dynamic visual-spatial storage and central-executive tasks except for the static visual-spatial storage task. Results at single times of measurement revealed that the most consistent deficit was found in the storage capacity of the phonological loop. An additional central-executive impairment is supported by low backward spans. The causes for output deficits in dynamic visual-spatial tasks and good performance under static visual-spatial condition are discussed.

TI  - What is the "craniosacral rhythm"? An article on employing "craniosacral osteopathy" (CSO) [Was ist der "kraniosakrale Rhythmus"? Ein Beitrag zum Umgang mit der "kraniosakralen Osteopathie" (CSO)]
PY  - 2006
AB  - Craniosacral osteopathic therapists claim the existence of an autonomous rhythm of the cerebrospinal fluid which they call the primary respiratory mechanism. These movements have not yet been proven nor has the active motility of the skull bones within their sutures. However, there is no doubt about a passive motility of the skull up to old age. Movements perceived by CSO therapists are therefore not produced in the patient's body. They are probably movements produced in the hands of the therapist by meditation and self-induced trance as an "energy wave" between his hands. Relations between this energy wave and the therapist's pulse and breath have not been sufficiently investigated. There is a possible correlation on the level of wave crossings of different frequencies. The waves generated by the therapist are induced into the skull of the patient, who may either react with a passive movement or will show a resistance towards this wave induction due to a disturbed function of the skull sutures. The positive and reliable use of such information for therapeutic action by a therapist has not been proven despite knowledge of anatomy and biomechanics. Only if the observations related to CSO are soundly explained on a scientific level could this method be integrated into manual medicine. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2006.

TI  - What is the better treatment for single digit dupuytren's contracture: surgical release or collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiapex) injection?
PY  - 2014
AB  - UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to compare the initial and final outcome range of motion in the MCP-J and PIP-J of single digit Dupuytren's Contracture treated with either open surgical excision or manipulation after collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH; Xiapex) injection.MATERIAL: Ten patients in either group. The range of motion measurements were statistically compared using the student t-test with a p-value of 0.05. There was no statistical difference in the pre-treatment status of the total active range of movement (TAM) between the two groups.RESULTS: Open surgical release achieved a statistically better initial outcome in combined total passive range of movement than the xiapex group (p = 0.0047), but at the final outcome the better TAM measurement at the MCP-J after surgery was not statistically significant. However, the total active range of movement was statistically better at the PIP-J level in the xiapex group (p = 0.01) and the MCP-J and PIP-J combined total active range of movement was statistically better in the xiapex group (p = 0.0258).CONCLUSION: Surgery achieved better initial outcome at both MCP-J and PIP-J levels, and at discharge, only extension in the MCP-J level was statistically better after open excision. However the final outcome was statistically better at the PIP-J level in extension (p = 0.006) and total active movement (TAM) (p = 0.008) after treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum. Further studies are required to assess the long-term differences between the two groups and to investigate the outcomes for patients with multi-digit involvement.

TI  - What part of an action interferes with ongoing perception?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated specific interference effects between concurrent perception and action. In the following we address the possible causes of such effects by employing a continuous paradigm in which participants were asked to produce movements in a specified direction and to judge the direction of a concurrently presented stimulus motion. In such paradigms, a repulsion of the perceived by the produced movement direction is typically observed. The first question addressed in the current study was whether passive displacements of the hand would be sufficient for inducing the repulsion effect. This was done by sometimes moving the participants' hands with a robot. No repulsion effect was found for these passive movements, which shows that the integration of visual and proprioceptive information is not sufficient for repulsion to arise. However, repulsion was present for active movements. that is when participants intended to move. In a second experiment, participants' movements were sometimes unexpectedly blocked by a robot. No repulsion was observed in the blocked condition. We conclude that the intention to move (Experiment 1) and actual movement execution (Experiment 2) are both necessary preconditions for this type of specific interference to arise in continuous and concurrent perception-action tasks.

TI  - What's the Best Post-TKA Intervention in the Acute Care Setting? There's No Easy Answer, Say Researchers
PY  - 2018
AB  - For patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA), this much is known: physical therapy in the acute care setting is a key component in successful rehabilitation. What's not so easy to pinpoint are the individual interventions associated with the best outcomes, according to authors of a new systematic review. Their investigation into 20 years' worth of clinical trials and other studies revealed no clear standout interventions but did find "very low" evidence for the use of cryotherapy, accelerated rehabilitation, and neurostimulation within the first 7 postoperative days (PODs). The study, published in the Journal of Acute Care Physical Therapy, involved extensive reviews of research published between 1996 and 2016 on various physical therapy-related interventions used in the acute care setting post-TKA. Authors were on the lookout for evidence of effectiveness of a particular approach, because, they write, "despite seemingly routine use of physical therapy and its potential importance in reducing complications after [total joint replacement] in the acute hospital setting, no approach to rehabilitation in this setting appears to be standard." In the end, through a review process that pared down a list of 686 research titles to 40 studies that met inclusion criteria, authors were able to come up with a definitive conclusion, albeit not the most rewarding one for those looking for guidance: existing evidence isn't strong enough to support any clear winners when it comes to post-TKA physical therapist interventions in the acute care setting. The studies that yielded no or weak evidence looked at approaches including additional sessions of rehabilitation, compression and manual lymph drainage, knee range-of-motion (ROM), continuous passive motion, knee ROM manual passive exercise, knee ROM-active assistive exercise, biofeedback, and acupressure, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine. According to authors, evidence either was insufficient or included a significant risk of bias, or both. Three other interventions fared somewhat better than the rest, although none were supported by strong evidence. They were:

TI  - What's the risk of using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) to assess spasticity at the ankle?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Introduction Spasticity is one of the major sources of disability in patients with neurological impairment. In the clinical practice and in scientific research either the Ashworth Scale (AS) [1] or its Modified version (MAS) [2] are the most commonly used methods for the measurement of spasticity [3]. However, methodological limitations of this scale are now increasingly being acknowledged [4]. The resistance to passive movement measured by the MAS score is a sum of reflex and active muscle activity and of muscle non-neural passive characteristics. Conversely, a proper assessment of spasticity has to be exclusively associated with an increased stretch reflex activity [4]. Despite being known that the MAS score does not provide a direct measure of muscular reflex activity, it is still used in the decision making process for the treatment of spasticity. A reason for this behaviour could be in the lack, in literature, of a quantitative assessment of the false positive rate of MAS as indicator of spasticity. To clarify this topic, we assessed the false positive rate of the Ashworth Scale when used as a tool for the assessment of spasticity at the ankle. Materials and methods A sample of 80 sub-acute neurological patients (53 M, 27 F, age 56±17 years, average time since lesion 57±21 days) with hemiplegia (39 left, 41 right) were selected according to the following criteria. Inclusion criteria: upper motor neurone syndrome following cerebral vascular accident (CVA), less than 90 days from the vascular accident (sub-acute) to minimise the occurrence of muscle contractures and rigid retractions, unilateral clinical signs. (Table presented) Exclusion criteria: concomitant medullar lesion, akinesia or iperkinesia, hydrocephalus, cerebellar syndrome. Patients with elicitable ankle clonus were also excluded. A single experienced rater assessed the MAS score for all patients, at their bed, for gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL), and soleus (SOL) muscles. The presence of reflex muscular activity was measured by surface EMG, used as the criterion standard to assess the presence of spasticity. Bi-polar surface electrodes (ARBO H124 SG, diameter 15mm, interelectrode distance 20mm)were placed on the minimum crosstalk points recommended in [5].EMGdata were collected at 1000 Hz (PocketEMG, BTS, Italy). During the MAS assessment sEMG data were acquired but not displayed to ensure the assessor's blindness to the presence of EMG. The presence in sEMG traces of muscular activity consequent to the stretching manoeuvres was assessed separately by visual inspection by an experienced operator. This assessor was blind to any information on patients and, mainly, to all MAS scores. A score “Yes” was given to trials with EMG reflex activity, and a score “No” was given otherwise. Results Results are presented in Table 1. Discussion We investigated the diagnostic risk in the use of the Ashworth Scale as a tool for inferring the presence of spasticity at the ankle in a sample of 80 adult CVA patients. The global rate of false positive, that is the percentage of positive MAS scores assigned to patients who did not have a reflex activity at the MAS manoeuvre, approached 80% (Table 1). In practice, if one would suppose the presence of spasticity at the calf based on a positive MAS score, an error will be made on three CVA patients out of four. MAS does not reflect the presence of spasticity at the ankle in adults who have had a stroke. The treatment of spasticity at the ankle cannot rely on the Ashworth score for adult CVA patients.

TI  - What's your contribution to the clinical ethics process?
PY  - 2008
AB  - All healthcare providers -- nurses, physicians, dietitians, social workers, allied health therapists, and others -- should participate in the shared learning and discussion of clinical ethics. Certain researchers clearly describe the physician as legitimating the clinical ethics process by explaining that physicians should share healthcare decisions with well-informed patients who can understand their diagnoses, prognoses, and the various alternatives of proposed treatment and of nontreatment, and who can make decisions. Nursing focuses on health, whereas medicine focuses on cure. Continuous nursing care lends itself not only to greater trust but also to advocacy -- a perspective that shapes nursing ethics. Advocacy is more than passive listening. It's an active approach to communication. Processes and skills required to successfully advocate for patients include accountability ethical analysis and decision making, knowledge of and adherence to clinical standards and legal definitions of nursing practice, health education and counseling, leadership, collaboration, communication, and ability to implement change.

Furthermore, the standard Tower of Hanoi task and clothing exchange tasks independently, additively, and equivalently transferred to subsequent tasks, whereas the tea ceremony task did not. The results suggest that both familiarity and working memory demands determine overall level of performance, whereas familiarity influences transfer.

TI  - When Passive Feels Active - Delusion-Proneness Alters Self-Recognition in the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion
PY  - 2015
AB  - Psychotic patients have problems with bodily self-recognition such as the experience of self-produced actions (sense of agency) and the perception of the body as their own (sense of ownership). While it has been shown that such impairments in psychotic patients can be explained by hypersalient processing of external sensory input it has also been suggested that they lack normal efference copy in voluntary action. However, it is not known how problems with motor predictions like efference copy contribute to impaired sense of agency and ownership in psychosis or psychosis-related states. We used a rubber hand illusion based on finger movements and measured sense of agency and ownership to compute a bodily self-recognition score in delusion-proneness (indexed by Peters' Delusion Inventory - PDI). A group of healthy subjects (n=71) experienced active movements (involving motor predictions) or passive movements (lacking motor predictions). We observed a highly significant correlation between delusion-proneness and self-recognition in the passive conditions, while no such effect was observed in the active conditions. This was seen for both ownership and agency scores. The result suggests that delusion-proneness is associated with hypersalient external input in passive conditions, resulting in an abnormal experience of the illusion. We hypothesize that this effect is not present in the active condition because deficient motor predictions counteract hypersalience in psychosis proneness.

TI  - When does passive learning improve the effectiveness of active learning?
PY  - 2016
AB  - Much of what we learn comes from a mix of information that we select (active learning) and information that we receive (passive learning). But what type of learning is best for different kinds of learning problems? In the current work, we explore this question by comparing different sequences of active/passive training in an abstract concept learning task. First, we replicate the active learning advantage from Markant & Gureckis (2014) (Experiments 1a and 1b). Then, we provide a direct test of whether experiencing active learning first or passive learning first improves concept learning (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, active training led to better learning of the target concept, but “passive-first” learners performed better than “active-first” learners. These findings broaden our understanding of when different sequences of active/passive learning are most effective, showing that for certain learning problems active exploration can be enhanced by prior passive learning.

TI  - When is search for a static target among dynamic distractors efficient?
PY  - 2006
AB  - Intuitively, dynamic visual stimuli, such as moving objects or flashing lights, attract attention. Visual search tasks have revealed that dynamic targets among static distractors can indeed efficiently guide attention. The present study shows that the reverse case, a static target among dynamic distractors, allows for relatively efficient selection in certain but not all cases. A static target was relatively efficiently found among distractors that featured apparent motion, corroborating earlier findings. The important new finding was that static targets were equally easily found among distractors that blinked on and off continuously, even when each individual item blinked at a random rate. However, search for a static target was less efficient when distractors abruptly varied in luminance but did not completely disappear. The authors suggest that the division into the parvocellular pathway dealing with static visual information, on the one hand, and the magnocellular pathway common to motion and new object onset detection, on the other hand, allows for efficient filtering of dynamic and static information.

TI  - When one's sense of agency goes wrong: Overall decreased estimation of intervals and absent intentional binding in passivity symptoms of schizophrenia
PY  - 2015
AB  - Objective: Individuals with passivity symptoms feel that they are no longer in control of their actions, thoughts and other somatic experiences and often describe these processes as being under the control of an external agent. The dysfunctional mechanisms underlying passivity symptoms are still poorly understood. Internal timing mechanisms and intentional binding are both closely linked to action perception and both have previously been shown to be altered in schizophrenia, with some evidence for more severe timing dysfunctions in passivity symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess time perception and intentional binding in people with schizophrenia, in 15 people with passivity symptoms, 24 people without passivity symptoms and 43 healthy controls. Methods: This was achieved using an interval estimation procedure with 200, 400 and 600 ms intervals between a button press and a tone played through headphones and three movement conditions: intentional movements (active), externally-induced movements (passive) and observed movements of another agent (other). Results: The slope of the perceived interval across intervals was significantly lower in people with schizophrenia. Both controls and people without passivity symptoms, but not those with passivity symptoms, reported an increase in the perceive interval after active movements as compared to passive movements. Controls, but not people without passivity symptoms, perceived intervals to be longer after active movements compared to othergenerated movements. People with passivity symptoms did not display any modulation of time perception by movements (intervals after active, passive and other movements perceived as the same). Conclusion: Altogether, the results indicate an important role of time perception and intentional binding in schizophrenia. The absence of intentional binding in passivity symptoms may lead to an overreliance on external agency cues and, together with the reduced perception of intervals, lead to the subjective loss of agency over self-produced actions.

TI  - When your life and ears depend upon hearing protection: The conundrum of auditory situation awareness and attenuation
PY  - 2019
AB  - Prevention of noise-induced hearing loss via hearing protection devices (HPDs), together with concomitant preservation of one's auditory situation awareness (ASA) and vigilance to the surrounding acoustic environment, is critical. Examples include construction workers who wear electronic earmuffs but must hear backup alarms, emergency vehicle drivers who need hearing protection from the vehicle's siren but must also hear car horns and communications, and military personnel who wear gunfire-noise-protective headsets but must hear certain signals and speech. This paper reviews several ASA experiments on "augmented" HPDs, which rely on either passive (i.e., dynamic acoustic "valves" and filter) or active (i.e., battery-powered electronic) technologies, that are intended to provide "pass-through" hearing capability with concomitant hearing protection. Over the past decade, several in-field and in-lab experiments at Virginia Tech have demonstrated that certain augmented HPDs and Tactical-Communications-and-Protective-Systems (TCAPS) in fact do not provide natural hearing or "transparency," and have deleterious effects on ASA. Experimental stimuli have included vehicular warning alarms, military-relevant signals and other signatures of broadband, low-frequency, and high-frequency content. Measures of ASA performance have included: hearing threshold at detection, accuracy and response time in recognizing/identifying and localizing signals, and intelligibility of communications. Based on these experiments, an objective, repeatable test battery was developed for evaluating HPD and TCAPS effects on the ASA tasks of: Detection, Recognition/Identification, Localization (azimuth and frontal elevation), and COMmunication, known as "DRILCOM." Example results from the ASA testing using various signals are covered. Also, the interaction effects of HPD attenuation with the low-frequency interaural time difference (ITD) cues and high-frequency interaural level difference (ILD) cues that are so critical to localization are covered. It is postulated that standardized ASA testing of augmented HPDs and TCAPS, in similar fashion to commonplace and standardized attenuation testing, should be done before devices are deployed on personnel in dangerous environments © Proceedings of the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2019.

TI  - Where Is Your Arm? Variations in Proprioception Across Space and Tasks
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fuentes CT, Bastian AJ. Where is your arm? Variations in proprioception across space and tasks. J Neurophysiol 103: 164-171, 2010. First published October 28, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00494.2009. The sense of limb position is crucial for movement control and environmental interactions. Our understanding of this fundamental proprioceptive process, however, is limited. For example, little is known about the accuracy of arm proprioception: Does it vary with changes in arm configuration, since some peripheral receptors are engaged only when joints move toward extreme angles? Are these variations consistent across different tasks? Does proprioceptive ability change depending on what we try to localize (e. g., fingertip position vs. elbow angle)? We used a robot exoskeleton to study proprioception in 14 arm configurations across three tasks, asking healthy subjects to 1) match a pointer to elbow angles after passive movements, 2) match a pointer to fingertip positions after passive movements, and 3) actively match their elbow angle to a pointer. Across all three tasks, subjects overestimated more extreme joint positions; this may be due to peripheral sensory signals biasing estimates as a safety mechanism to prevent injury. We also found that elbow angle estimates were more precise when used to judge fingertip position versus directly reported, suggesting that the brain has better access to limb endpoint position than joint angles. Finally, precision of elbow angle estimates improved in active versus passive movements, corroborating work showing that efference copies of motor commands and alpha-gamma motor neuron coactivation contribute to proprioceptive estimates. In sum, we have uncovered fundamental aspects of normal proprioceptive processing, demonstrating not only predictable biases that are dependent on joint configuration and independent of task but also improved precision when integrating information across joints.

PY  - 1982
AB  - Discusses C. S. Sherrington's (1900) view of the origin of "muscle sense" (kinesthetic sensations), which states that the perceptions of muscular sense may be grouped into those of posture, passive movement, active movement, and resistance to movement. Changes in consciousness accompany all movements of the body that occur at speeds above a certain amount. It is suggested that the sense organs in muscles play the crucial role in kinesthesia, with the sensation referred to the relevant joint and "body image" rather than to the muscles themselves.

TI  - Where to Look Next? Combining Static and Dynamic Proto-objects in a TVA-based Model of Visual Attention
PY  - 2010
AB  - To decide "Where to look next ?" is a central function of the attention system of humans, animals and robots. Control of attention depends on three factors, that is, low-level static and dynamic visual features of the environment (bottom-up), medium-level visual features of proto-objects and the task (top-down). We present a novel integrated computational model that includes all these factors in a coherent architecture based on findings and constraints from the primate visual system. The model combines spatially inhomogeneous processing of static features, spatio-temporal motion features and task-dependent priority control in the form of the first computational implementation of saliency computation as specified by the "Theory of Visual Attention" (TVA, [7]). Importantly, static and dynamic processing streams are fused at the level of visual proto-objects, that is, ellipsoidal visual units that have the additional medium-level features of position, size, shape and orientation of the principal axis. Proto-objects serve as input to the TVA process that combines top-down and bottom-up information for computing attentional priorities so that relatively complex search tasks can be implemented. To this end, separately computed static and dynamic proto-objects are filtered and subsequently merged into one combined map of proto-objects. For each proto-object, attentional priorities in the form of attentional weights are computed according to TVA. The target of the next saccade is the center of gravity of the proto-object with the highest weight according to the task. We illustrate the approach by applying it to several real world image sequences and show that it is robust to parameter variations.

TI  - Which are the most important discriminatory items for subclassifying non-specific low back pain? A Delphi study among Greek health professionals
PY  - 2010
AB  - Rationale, aims and objectivesDeveloping homogenous low back pain (LBP) classification groups is recommended for enhancing clinical outcomes. However, an important step towards the development of specific subgroups is the selection and consensus agreement among health professionals on the discriminatory clinical items (sings and symptoms) that should be included in the classification process. Thus, this study's objective was to develop a list of clinical features for the assessment of LBP by health care providers within Greece, which are believed to be discriminatory in identifying LBP subgroups.MethodsA random sample stratified by geographical region and work status of 150 Greek physiotherapists (PTs) participated in a two-round Delphi study. PTs were asked to obtain consensus and hierarchy, the most important items out of a list of evaluating/diagnostic features believed to be discriminatory for LBP patients. These items included 80 clinical features and were generated in by PTs and doctors previous work.ResultsSecond-round questionnaires were returned by 112 PTs (74.6% response rate). A total of 66 clinical features were rated as important discriminatory items in LBP assessment. Clinical items included characteristics of present symptoms and the history's condition, general medical history, information regarding patient function, patients' attitudes regarding movement, diagnosis, expectations, fear-avoidance beliefs as well as aspects of a physical examination including observation, active and passive movements, neurological and muscular examination.ConclusionsThis is the first study identifying important clinical items for LBP patients in Greece. It may be that these features are 'discriminatory' for different LBP subsets; however, further research is needed.

TI  - Which patients with persistent mechanical low back pain will respond to high load motor control training?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore variables influencing success or failure of eight weeks of high load motor control training with the conventional deadlift exercise. Relevance: Researching viable exercises for rehabilitation of specific sub-groups of persistent low back pain is relevant for physical therapists in order to develop tailored treatment regimes for patients with persistent low back pain. This study contributes to this research by exploring which variables characterize the ideal patient for the conventional deadlift exercise. Participants: Thirty-five patients with persistent mechanical low back pain were recruited consecutively from two occupational health care services in Umea, Sweden. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to include patients with persistent mechanical low back pain. Methods: The study design was a prospective cohort study. The intervention consisted of eight weeks of training with the conventional deadlift exercise. To discriminate between patients with a successful or failed outcome of treatment, change in the patient-specific functional scale was used and a cut-off at 50% improvement was set. Possible predictive variables collected at baseline included physical activity level, pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), activity limitation (the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), specific anamnestic questions regarding patients' history and symptoms of low back pain, test of active movement control of the low back, trunk muscle endurance(Prone bridge test, Side-bridge test, Biering-Sorensen test) and lift strength (static two-hand lift test), two-point discrimination of the lowback and ultrasound imaging of the mm. multifidi. Analysis: Student's t-test for normally distributed continuous data, Mann-Whitney for non-normally distributed continuous data and chi-square tests or Fisher's Exact tests for categorical variables were used for analyses of differences between the success and the failure group. Results: No significant differences between groups were found in background, anamnestic or physical performance variables. After eight weeks of training, 15 patients (43%) were categorized as treatment success and 20 patients (57%) were categorized as treatment failure according to the cut-off set for the PSFS. The patients reported difficulty in performing a wide variation of activities, ranging from not being able to sit for longer than 15 minutes, to stand upright and watch their children play football games, and to not being able to run long distances, play football or perform different lifting tasks. Conclusions: We conclude that the conventional deadlift exercise may be considered a possible exercise to improve patients' activity limitations, if administered by a therapist experienced in resistance training and analyzing movement patterns. However, further research is needed to explore which variables can define patients in the successful and in the failure group, respectively. Implications: The results of this study imply that the conventional deadlift exercise can be used in treatment of patients with mechanical low back pain in order to increase activity limitation. However, it is still unclear on what grounds treatment with the conventional deadlift exercise is indicated to achieve these results.

TI  - Whisker encoding of mechanical events during active tactile exploration
PY  - 2012
AB  - Rats use their whiskers to extract a wealth of information about their immediate environment, such as the shape, position or texture of an object. The information is conveyed to mechanoreceptors located within the whisker follicle in the form of a sequence of whisker deflections induced by the whisker/object contact interaction. How the whiskers filter and shape the mechanical information and effectively participate in the coding of tactile features remains an open question to date. In the present article, a biomechanical model was developed that provides predictions of the whisker dynamics during active tactile exploration, amenable to quantitative experimental comparison. This model is based on a decomposition of the whisker profile into a slow, quasi-static sequence and rapid resonant small-scale vibrations. It was applied to the typical situation of a rat actively whisking across a solid object. Having derived the quasi-static sequence of whisker deformation, the resonant properties of the whisker were analyzed, taking in to account the boundary conditions imposed by the whisker/surfacecontact. We then focused on two elementary mechanical events that are expected to trigger significant neural responses, namely (1) the whisker/object first contact and (2) the whisker detachment from the object. Both events were found to trigger a deflection wave propagating upward to the mystacial pad at constant velocity of approximate to 3-5 m/s. This yielded a characteristic mechanical signature at the whisker base, in the form of a large peak of negative curvature occurring approximate to 4 ms after the event has been triggered. The dependence in amplitude and lag of this mechanical signal with the main contextual parameters (such as radial or angular distance) was investigated. The model was validated experimentally by comparing its predictions to high-speed video recordings of shock-induced whisker deflections performed on anesthetized rats. The consequences of these results on possible tactile encoding schemes are briefly discussed.

TI  - Who is causing what? The sense of agency is relational and efferent-triggered
PY  - 2008
AB  - The sense of agency ("I did that") is a basic feature of our subjective experience. Experimental studies usually focus on either its attributional aspects (the "I" of "I did that") or on its motoric aspects (the "did" aspect of "I did that"). Here, we combine both aspects and focus on the subjective experience of the time between action and effect. Previous studies [Haggard, P., Aschersleben, G., Gehrke, J., & Prinz, W. (2002a). Action, binding and awareness. In W. Prinz, & B. Hommel (Eds.), Common mechanisms in perception and action., Attention and performance (Vol. XIX, pp. 266-285). Oxford: Oxford University Press] have shown a temporal attraction in the perceived times of actions and effects, but did directly not study the relation between them.In three experiments, time estimates of an interval between an action and its subsequent sensory effect were obtained. The actions were either voluntary key press actions performed by the participant or kinematically identical movements applied passively to the finger. The effects were either auditory or visual events or a passive movement induced to another finger.The results first indicated a shortening of the interval between one's own voluntary action and a subsequent effect, relative to passive movement conditions. Second, intervals initiated by observed movements, either of another person or of an inanimate object, were always perceived like those involving passive movements of one's own body, and never like those involving active movements. Third, this binding effect was comparable for auditory, somatic and visual effects of action. Our results provide the first direct evidence that agency involves a generalisable relation between actions and their consequences, and is triggered by efferent motor commands. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Community participation in planning is generally considered crucial for the delivery of positive outcomes; however, the network structures of stakeholders such as community groups are not widely understood. This paper explores the use of social media, specifically Twitter, by five community groups. In the context of this study, community groups are self-created and organized groups of citizens that form to oppose a proposal to amend planning controls for a specific site. Utilizing the research technique of Social Network Analysis (SNA), this paper seeks to visualize the community group networks, as well as understand the connectedness and clustering of the networks. For the five community groups investigated, it was found that they are led by a small number of active people, which do not attract large numbers of friends and followers on Twitter and key stakeholders play a passive listening role in the networks.

TI  - Whole body vibration exercise training for fibromyalgia
PY  - 2017
AB  - BackgroundExercise training is commonly recommended for adults with fibromyalgia. We defined whole body vibration (WBV) exercise as use of a vertical or rotary oscillating platform as an exercise stimulus while the individual engages in sustained static positioning or dynamic movements. The individual stands on the platform, and oscillations result in vibrations transmitted to the subject through the legs. This review is one of a series of reviews that replaces the first review published in 2002.ObjectivesTo evaluate benefits and harms of WBV exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, Thesis and Dissertation Abstracts, AMED, WHOICTRP, and ClinicalTrials. gov up to December 2016, unrestricted by language, to identify potentially relevant trials.Selection criteriaWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia based on published criteria including a WBV intervention versus control or another intervention. Major outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain intensity, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed risk of bias assessments, and assessed the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. We used a 15% threshold for calculation of clinically relevant differences.Main resultsWe included four studies involving 150 middle-aged female participants from one country. Two studies had two treatment arms (71 participants) that compared WBV plus mixed exercise plus relaxation versus mixed exercise plus relaxation and placebo WBV versus control, and WBV plus mixed exercise versus mixed exercise and control; two studies had three treatment arms (79 participants) that compared WBV plus mixed exercise versus control and mixed relaxation placebo WBV. We judged the overall risk of bias as low for selection (random sequence generation), detection (objectively measured outcomes), attrition, and other biases; as unclear for selection bias (allocation concealment); and as high for performance, detection (self-report outcomes), and selective reporting biases.The WBV versus control comparison reported on three major outcomes assessed at 12 weeks post intervention based on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) (0 to 100 scale, lower score is better). Results for HRQL in the control group at end of treatment (59.13) showed a mean difference (MD) of -3.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.81 to 3.35) for absolute HRQL, or improvement of 4% (11% better to 3% worse) and relative improvement of 6.7% (19.6% better to 6.1% worse). Results for withdrawals indicate that 14 per 100 and 10 per 100 in the intervention and control groups, respectively, withdrew from the intervention (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 7.67; absolute change 4%, 95% CI 16% fewer to 24% more; relative change 43% more, 95% CI 73% fewer to 667% more). The only adverse event reported was acute pain in the legs, for which one participant dropped out of the program. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes as very low. This study did not measure pain intensity, fatigue, stiffness, or physical function. No outcomes in this comparison met the 15% threshold for clinical relevance.The WBV plus mixed exercise (aerobic, strength, flexibility, and relaxation) versus control study (N = 21) evaluated symptoms at six weeks post intervention using the FIQ. Results for HRQL at end of treatment (59.64) showed an MD of -16.02 (95% CI -31.57 to -0.47) for absolute HRQL, with improvement of 16% (0.5% to 32%) and relative change in HRQL of 24% (0.7% to 47%). Data showed a pain intensity MD of -28.22 (95% CI -43.26 to -13.18) for an absolute difference of 28% (13% to 43%) and a relative change of 39% improvement (18% to 60%); as well as a fatigue MD of -33 (95% CI -49 to -16) for an absolute difference of 33% (16% to 49%) and relative difference of 47% (95% CI 23% to 60%); and a stiffness MD of -26.27 (95% CI -42.96 to -9.58) for an absolute difference of 26% (10% to 43%) and a relative difference of 36.5% (23% to 60%). All-cause withdrawals occurred in 8 per 100 and 33 per 100 withdrawals in the intervention and control groups, respectively (two studies, N = 46; RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.12) for an absolute risk difference of 24% (3% to 51%). One participant exhibited a mild anxiety attack at the first session of WBV. No studies in this comparison reported on physical function. Several outcomes (based on the findings of one study) in this comparison met the 15% threshold for clinical relevance: HRQL, pain intensity, fatigue, and stiffness, which improved by 16%, 39%, 46%, and 36%, respectively. We found evidence of very low quality for all outcomes.The WBV plus mixed exercise versus other exercise provided very lowquality evidence for all outcomes. Investigators evaluated outcomes on a 0 to 100 scale (lower score is better) for pain intensity (one study, N = 23; MD -16.36, 95% CI -29.49 to -3.23), HRQL (two studies, N = 49; MD -6.67, 95% CI -14.65 to 1.31), fatigue (one study, N = 23; MD -14.41, 95% CI -29.47 to 0.65), stiffness (one study, N = 23; MD -12.72, 95% CI -26.90 to 1.46), and all-cause withdrawal (three studies, N = 77; RR 0.72, 95% CI -0.17 to 3.11). Adverse events reported for the three studies included one anxiety attack at the first session of WBV and one dropout from the comparison group ("other exercise group") due to an injury that was not related to the program. No studies reported on physical function.Authors' conclusionsWhether WBV or WBV in addition to mixed exercise is superior to control or another intervention for women with fibromyalgia remains uncertain. The quality of evidence is very low owing to imprecision (few study participants and wide confidence intervals) and issues related to risk of bias. These trials did not measure major outcomes such as pain intensity, stiffness, fatigue, and physical function. Overall, studies were few and were very small, which prevented meaningful estimates of harms and definitive conclusions about WBV safety.

TI  - Whole-body Vibration in Spastic Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cerebral palsy is the most common childhood disabilities affecting individual's posture and movement. Cerebral palsy is a disorder that causes activity limitations attributed to non‐progressive disturbances of the foetal or infant brain that may also affect sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. Cerebral palsy (CP) results from damage to the developing central nervous system while in utero, during delivery, or during the first two years of life. The most common movement disorder in Cerebral palsy is a spastic paresis, defined as a posture and movement‐dependent tone regulation disorder.The most common signs of the disorder are spasticity, rigidity, muscle weakness, ataxia, balance and movement disorders. Compared to the typically developed children, these children have impaired sensation and increased muscle tone therefore they have trouble voluntarily controlling their muscles. Cerebral Palsy can be grouped based on the motor effects it has on the individual, these can include spastic Cerebral palsy or non‐spastic Cerebral palsy. Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common type and is associated with tight or contracted muscles. Cerebral Palsy is more prevalent in more deprived socio‐economic populations. Cerebral palsy is a disease that globally has a prevalence of 2 to 3 cases per 1,000 live born neonates. An increase in the prevalence of CP was also seen in low birth weight survivors from the Mersey region of the United Kingdom for the same period. Pilot studies of severe mental retardation conducted in selected populations in Pakistan and India have reported extraordinarily high prevalence estimates in the range of 12‐24 /1,000 Spasticity may be defined as a motor disorder characterised by a velocity‐dependent exaggeration of stretch reflexes resulting from abnormal intraspinal processing of primary afferent input. The impaired sensation and increase in tone leads to wide range in movement dysfunction. About seventy to eighty percent of children with Cerebral Palsy demonstrate spastic clinical features. Many children with cerebral palsy (CP) have poor walking abilities and manipulation skills. One contributing factor to their problems with gait and reaching movement is poor balance control. Balance control is important as it helps a child to recover from unexpected balance disturbances.Currently, there are many options for the management of spasticity, balance disturbances and risk of fall that includes physical modalities, oral pharmacologic agents, peripheral injectables, intrathecal agents, and surgical interventions, however mostly physical therapy is commonly preferable treatment that includes stretching, NDT, Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitations,strength training and gait training. Dynamic mechanical loading of the skeleton is an arduous task and troublesome to induce in children who suffer from severe cerebral palsy. The lack of dynamic weight bearing in this population predisposes them to reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and pre‐mature osteoporosis. These children are also more prone to muscle weakness, which contributes to pain, deformity and functional loss. Whole‐body vibration training was proposed as a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of the gross motor function, balance and functional performance Whole body vibration (WBV), for which the participant stands on a vibrating platform, delivers low‐frequency, low‐amplitude mechanical stimuli that enter the human body via the feet. The vibrations stimulate the muscle spindles and alpha motor neuron sending nerve impulses to initiate muscle contractions according to the tonic vibration reflex. Compared to the repetitive passive movement, this WBV protocol adds a muscle strengthening component to the anti‐spastic effects. Activity restrictions in spastic cerebral palsy are mainly due to poor postural control. Many interventions like resisting exercises, therapeutic horseback riding, electrical stimulations leads to short term posture and balance improvement. Training using vibration platforms adjunct to exercise has shown to be effective in increasing strength resulting in improved balance and coordination. Whole body vibration has shown to be effective in reducing lower limb spasticity after first application of WBV with a vibration frequency of 12 Hz to 18 Hz ( 2‐3 m of amplitude ) for 9 minutes and a significant decrease in tone is observed and even the functional mobility and balance is improved.. During all of the vibration‐training sessions, the children will wear the gymnastic shoes to standardize the damping of the vibration due to footwear. There is paucity in the literature regarding evidence for the safe and effective use of vibration intervention in children with or without pathology and has great effects in spasticity, mobility and improving balance.Chia‐Ling Chen concluded that the WBV is an effective intervention for controlling spasticity and improving ambulation. Villarreal et al.showed that 20‐week WBV therapy had positive effects on the balance of DS adolescents, although only under specific conditions, with vision and somatosensory input altered. In previous studies high dosage of whole body vibration has both positive and negative effects. Because this type of treatment seems to improve bone health, The purpose of this intervention is to ensure functional independence in cerebral palsy patients. Whole Body Vibration Therapy has proven to be effective in improving balance by reducing spasticity and improving muscle strength. It is essential to explore new interventions for patients specially for cerebral palsy in whom functional independence is impaired thus their mobility is restricted leading to secondary complications. In my study my goal is to use combination of conventional physical therapy with whole body vibration which can control spasticity and enhance ambulatory performance.

TI  - Whole-body vibration effects on the muscle activity of upper and lower body muscles during the baseball swing in recreational baseball hitters
PY  - 2011
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) on the muscle recruitment of selected upper and lower body muscles during the baseball swing. Participants were recreationally trained males (n = 16, 22 +/- 2 years, 181.4 +/- 7.4 cm, 84.7 +/- 9.0 kg), with previous baseball experience. Subjects participated in three randomized sessions on separate days, consisting of three sets of five swings off a hitting tee. Exercises (upper and lower body dynamic and static movements) with or without WBV exposure were performed between swing sets. During each swing, the gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and triceps brachii were evaluated for electromyographic (EMG) activity. EMG values were normalized to EMG measured during maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in EMG activity across the three treatments. In addition, the results displayed a specific muscle recruitment order during the swing, starting with the lower body followed by the upper body muscles. This study was the first to report the recruitment order during the baseball swing. Although acute exposure to WBV did not significantly alter the muscle recruitment, these results may prove useful for practitioners looking to enhance baseball swing performance.

TI  - Why 'building it' doesn't always mean they will come - Understanding reactions to behaviour change measures
PY  - 2014
AB  - The vast majority of government-led strategies to prepare Australia for a more resilient and prosperous future revolve around two broad approaches: measures of supply and demand. Government action such as infrastructure projects, technological innovations and policy development through pricing and regulation, fall either distinctly into one or between both of these. This paper argues that to help overcome public inertia concerning such 'top-down' government measures and to improve their implementation, a 'joined-up' approach, linking traditional approaches with voluntary measures that empower the public to make better-informed decisions beneficial to themselves, their community and the environment should be followed. Whilst still government-led, these measures can be described as 'bottom-up' as the onus is on the individual and community to carry out the action (often chosen by themselves), not the government itself. It firstly documents examples and research that describe why single-focus approaches sometimes do not realise the full potential of their intended outcomes. It then describes examples of recent voluntary measures in a range of fields including transport, energy and water. Four common themes of successful voluntary measures are identified, as follows: 1. Create opportunities of engagement and contact that have a strong, personal human element; 2. Design content that localises issues and appeals to participants' 'heads, hands and hearts'; 3. Provide ongoing support through a variety of passive and active touch-points that create moments of cognitive dissonance and accountability; and 4. Show proof that desired behaviours are normal by comparing actions of similar participants and using social hierarchies to spread positive behaviours. A case study of the 2009/10 Living Smart Households program is provided as an example of the way in which a program can employ combinations from the three approaches of supply, demand and voluntary measures and achieve high-reach, high-impact results in a range of fields including the reduction of personal car trips in the order of five per cent. The paper concludes by discussing the benefits of 'joined-up' approaches, highlighting the progress various government agencies in Australia and abroad are making, and reflecting on the opportunities and challenges of designing such approaches.

TI  - Why Self-Induced Pain Feels Less Painful than Externally Generated Pain: Distinct Brain Activation Patterns in Self- and Externally Generated Pain
PY  - 2011
AB  - Voluntary movement generally inhibits sensory systems. However, it is not clear how such movement influences pain. In the present study, subjects actively or passively experienced mechanical pain or pressure during functional MRI scanning. Pain and pressure were induced using two modified grip strengthener rings, each twined with four crystal bead strings, with polyhedral beads to induce pain, or spherical beads to induce pressure. Subjects held one ring in the left hand and were either asked to squeeze their left hand with their right hand (i.e., active pain or pressure), or to have their left hand squeezed by the experimenter (i.e., passive pain or pressure). Subjects rated the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain sensation lower in the active procedure than in the passive one. Correspondingly, pain-related brain areas were inhibited in the case of self-generated pain, including the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the thalamus. These results suggest that active movement behaviorally inhibits concomitant mechanical pain, accompanied by an inhibition of pain response in pain-related brain areas such as the SI cortex. This might be part of the mechanisms underlying the kinesitherapy for pain treatment.

TI  - Why pinnipeds don't echolocate
PY  - 2000
AB  - Odontocete cetaceans have evolved a highly advanced system of active biosonar. It has been hypothesized that other groups of marine animals, such as the pinnipeds, possess analogous sound production, reception, and processing mechanisms that allow for underwater orientation using active echolocation. Despite sporadic investigation over the past 30 years, the accumulated evidence in favor of the pinniped echolocation hypothesis is unconvincing. We argue that an advanced echolocation system is unlikely to have evolved in pinnipeds primarily because of constraints imposed by the obligate amphibious functioning of the pinniped auditory system. As a result of these constraints, pinnipeds have not developed highly acute, aquatic, high frequency sound production or reception systems required for underwater echolocation. Instead, it appears that pinnipeds have evolved enhanced visual, tactile, and passive listening skills. The evolutionary refinement of alternative sensory systems allows pinnipeds to effectively forage, navigate, and avoid predators under water despite the lack of active biosonar capabilities.

TI  - Wide-Area Haptic Guidance: Taking the User by the Hand
PY  - 2010
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel use of haptic information in extended range telepresence, the wide-area haptic guidance. It consists of force and position signals applied to the user's hand in order to improve safety, accuracy, and speed in some telepresent tasks. Wide-area haptic guidance assists the user in reaching a desired position in a remote environment of arbitrary size without degrading the feeling of presence. Several methods for haptic guidance are analyzed. With active haptic guidance, the user is guided by superimposed forces that pull him into the desired direction of motion, whereas under passive haptic guidance, the movement of the user is lightened in the preferred direction and constrained in the other directions. By using closed-loop haptic guidance instead of open-loop haptic guidance, not only is the user guided to his target but also the deviation from the desired target path is reduced. The proposed guidance methods were tested with a haptic interface specifically designed for extended range telepresence.

TI  - Wide-Awake Flexor Pollicis Longus Tendon Reconstruction with Evaluation of the Active Voluntary Contraction of the Ruptured Muscle-Tendon
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of the wide-awake tendon reconstruction for chronic rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon with evaluation of the voluntary active contraction distance of the ruptured musculotendinous unit. Eleven consecutive patients underwent tendon reconstruction under wide-awake surgery. If the total of the passive distraction distance and the active contraction distance of the ruptured flexor pollicis longus musculotendinous unit was greater than 30 mm, tendon grafting was performed. If not, tendon transfer was performed using the fourth flexor digitorum superficialis. Patients were evaluated with total active motion before surgery, during surgery, and in final follow-up and subjectively surveyed with quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores. The final outcomes of tendon grafting and of tendon transfer were compared. Tendon grafting was performed in four patients, and tendon transfer was performed in seven patients. The final follow-up total active motion was 84.3 +/- 12.7 percent in the tendon transfer group and 80.7 +/- 10.2 percent in the tendon grafting group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the final follow-up total active motion percentage and quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores. The functional outcomes of both tendon grafting and tendon transfer were acceptable based on evaluating the active contraction distance and passive distraction distance of the ruptured musculotendinous unit during wide-awake surgery. Evaluating these distances may be a useful index to assess the ruptured musculotendinous unit. The greatest advantage of the wide-awake tendon reconstruction is that surgeons can evaluate the ruptured musculotendinous unit and measure total active motion during surgery while adjusting suture tension.

TI  - Wide-Awake Wrist Arthroscopy and Open TFCC Repair.
PY  - 2012
AB  - The wide-awake approach to hand surgery entails the use of local infiltration anesthesia using lidocaine with epinephrine and no tourniquet. The technique provides practitioners with an option to perform advanced hand surgical care in an ambulatory setting, without the need for general or regional anesthetics. We present our results using wide-awake approach in wrist surgery, both open and arthroscopic. Between June and August 2011, the wide-awake approach was used in nine elective wrist surgery cases; three arthroscopic procedures, four open triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repairs, and two combined arthroscopy/open surgery (eight men/one woman). The arthroscopic patients were anesthetized using dorsal infiltration of lidocaine with epinephrine (20mL) with an additional intra-articular 5mL injection 30 minutes before surgery. The open surgery patients received 40mL of lidocaine with epinephrine around the ulnar aspect of the forearm, from 8-cm proximal to 3-cm distal to the distal radioulnar joint. Standard diagnostic radio- and midcarpal arthroscopies were performed, where one patient had a loose body removed and two patients underwent TFCC debridements due to central TFCC tears. The six open cases were all due to TFCC foveal disruptions, which were reinserted using osteosutures in the distal ulna. Following placement of the ligament sutures, a preliminary knot allowed active and passive motion testing of pronosupination, to determine the adequate amount of tension in the ligaments. The wide-awake approach to wrist surgery is a plausible and reliable technique that eliminates the need for general anesthesia, removes the need of a tourniquet, and provides a cost-efficient and safe approach to wrist surgery. The ability to control ligament reconstructions using active motion may additionally enhance the rehabilitation of these patients, both through early proprioceptive awareness and adequate tensioning of soft tissues.

AB  - The minimally invasive nature of wrist and small joint arthroscopy renders it particularly suitable for the application of the wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) technique. The application of WALANT wrist and small joint arthroscopy has given surgeons the ability to visualize both static and dynamic movements of a joint, to show the pathology and discuss with the patient, and to visualize a patient's repaired structures. This reinforces confidence in surgeons and encourages patients to comply with postoperative rehabilitation.

TI  - Winter behavior of bats and the progression of white-nose syndrome in the southeastern United States
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding the winter behavior of bats in temperate North America can provide insight into how bats react to perturbations caused by natural disturbances such as weather, human-induced disturbances, or the introduction of disease. This study measured the activity patterns of bats outside of their hibernaculum and asked how this winter activity varied by time, temperature, bat species, body condition, and WNS status. Over the course of three winters (2011-2013), we collected acoustic data and captured bats outside of five hibernacula in Tennessee, United States. During this time, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome, became established in hibernacula throughout the region, allowing us to track disease-related changes in the winter behavior of ten bat species. We determined that bats in the southeastern United States were active during winter regardless of disease. We recorded activity outside of hibernacula at temperatures as low as -13 degrees C. Although bat activity was best determined by a combination of variables, the strongest factor was mean daily temperature (R-2 = .2879, F-1,F-1450 = 586.2, p < .0001). Bats that left the hibernacula earlier in evening had lower body condition than those that left 2-4 hr after sunset (F-7,F-932 = 7.225, p <.0001, Tukey HSD, p < .05). The number of daytime emergences from hibernacula, as determined via acoustic detection, increased the longer a site was P. destructans positive (F-3,F-17 808 = 124.48, p < .0001, Tukey HSD, p < .05). Through the use of passive acoustic monitoring and monthly captures, we determined that winter activity was driven by both ambient temperature and the presence of P.destructans.

TI  - Wireless sensors with dual-controller architecture for active diagnosis in structural health monitoring
PY  - 2008
AB  - Wireless sensor technology, which integrates transducers with microcontrollers and wireless communication, has become increasingly vital in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. However, the low I/O (input/output) throughput of conventional wireless sensors impedes their usage in applications using high-frequency signals, such as active diagnosis and passive acoustic emission (AE). In this paper, the limitations of extending conventional wireless sensors to handle high-speed acquisition are first identified and discussed. Based on the efforts made in improving wireless sensors with centralized system architecture, a novel dual-controller based architecture is proposed to facilitate high-speed data acquisition and improve power efficiency. Then, a wireless sensor platform, specifically designed for active diagnosis employing stress waves to localize damages, is presented. The newly developed wireless sensor with dimensions of 30 mm x 30 mm x 35 mm utilizes a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as a secondary controller and can support a sampling rate up to 20 million samples per second (Msps). Laboratory experiments for verification show that the wireless sensor can explore new applications at the opposite end of the spectrum from conventional applications: those involving high fidelity and high-speed data acquisition.

TI  - Withdrawal: Effects of strouhal numbers on asymmetric vortices control using plasma actuation
PY  - 2018
AB  - © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved. This work is purposed to detect the dynamic movement of the asymmetric vortex over the conical body under unsteady plasma actuation. The test free stream speed is U ∞ = 5 m/s with the Reynolds number of Re D = 40,000. The test angle of attack is set at α = 45°. A pair of plasma actuator is placed at the azimuth angle of θ = ±90°symmetrically on the model apex. The unsteady actuation is applied with the duty-cycle ratio of τ = 1% - 99% and the frequency of St = 0.73 and 146.9. The result concludes the induced flow properties in the static atmosphere and the dynamic characteristic of asymmetric vortex field under the actuation in the wind tunnel. Surface pressure measurement and PIV technique were used to observe the vortex flow field. The result shows that the asymmetric vortex field becomes more stable under high-frequency actuation with nearly no vorticity transfer. The instantaneous relative position of two vortices can be fixed at the middle condition of the bi-stable state.

AB  - Effects of learning can show up in a direct, i.e., an explicit, way\nor they can be expressed indirectly, i.e., in an implicit way. It\nwas investigated whether motor processes underlie effects of repetition\npriming in haptic information exploration. In the test phase, blindfolded\nsubjects had to handle objects in order to answer questions as fast\nas possible about their properties (e.g., temperature, texture, weight,\nor form), exploring the object with their hands. Some of the objects\nwere old ones (presented in a study phase); others were added as\nnew objects to the test phase. In addition, recognition judgements\nwere required. The results demonstrated reliable effects of repetition\npriming in terms of reaction times to old, in comparison with new,\nobjects for subjects who had been treated the same way in the study\nphase (active touch). Passive touch at encoding or studying the names\nor the visible objects themselves did not lead to effects of repetition\npriming in the test phase. On the other hand, performing adequate\nhand movements during the study improved recognition memory. The\nrole of motor processes in indirect and direct tests of memory is\ndiscussed and related to research on memory of action events.

TI  - Word-induced postural changes reflect a tight interaction between motor and lexico-semantic representations
PY  - 2013
AB  - A tight coupling between lexico-semantic access and motor control has been established on the basis of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and behavioral evidence. For example, sensory and motor cortices have been shown to be active when subjects listen to words denoting bodily actions. Kinematic analyses of subjects' motor actions during the processing of linguistic stimuli provide further insights into the nature and time-course of this relationship. However, such studies have largely focused on individual body parts, in particular the upper limbs, thus neglecting the effect of language processing on lower or whole body representations. The present study bridges this gap by evaluating the interaction between linguistic processing and whole-body postural control during quiet standing. The results reveal a systematic influence of passive listening to action verbs, but not mental-state verbs, on measures of postural control, pointing to a clear and specific neural link between words conveying action concepts and whole-body motor functions.

AB  - Background:Balance skills are challenged at the roofing worksite by dynamic visual cues in the form of clouds and trees that move with the wind; any instability may result in a fall from height.Aim:To determine if roofers are less susceptible to a dynamic visual surround (moving room) when stationary cues were available, relative to people who do not work in a similar environment.Methods:Forty male adults participated, including young roofers (N=10,26.3 years), middle-aged roofers (N=10,50.6 years), young controls (N=10,26.2 years) and middle-aged controls (N=10,55.1 years). Center of pressure root mean square (APRMS) was assessed during quiet standing and four moving room conditions when stationary cues were:(1)not in place,(2)in the foreground (inside the moving room),(3)in the background (outside the moving room, but still visible) and (4)in the foreground and background. Results:A workgroup by visual cue interaction was observed (p=0.032), where roofers had up to 18% lower APRMS relative to controls when the background references were in place. The interaction effect was independent of age. Interpretation:The roofers were able to suppress visually-induced postural sway when stationary visual cues were present in the background, likely due to the severe consequences for loss of balance when working at height. The suppression was maintained in aging workers.

TI  - Working principle simulations of a dynamic resonant wall shear stress sensor concept
PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper discusses a novel dynamic resonant wall shear stress sensor concept based on an oscillating sensor operating near resonance. The interaction between the oscillating sensor surface and the fluid above it is modelled using the unsteady laminar boundary layer equations. The numerical experiment shows that the effect of the oscillating shear stress is well correlated by the Hummer number, the ratio of the steady shear force caused by the outside flow to the oscillating viscous force created by the sensor motion. The oscillating shear stress predicted by the fluid model is used in a mechanical model of the sensor to predict the sensor's dynamic motion. Static calibration curves for amplitude and frequency influences are predicted. These results agree with experimental results on some extent, and shows some expectation for further development of the dynamic resonant sensor concept.

TI  - WormTIP: An Invertebrate Inspired Active Tactile Imaging Pneumostat
PY  - 2015
AB  - WormTIP is a novel lightweight self-actuating exploratory sensor, using a pneumostatic vessel and a dielectric elastomeric actuator (DEA) to create an active sensory tip capable of object shape determination as part of a flexible soft robot. Utilising the coupling of a static fluid vessel, the DEA is paired with a sensory membrane with internal papillae mimicking the internal morphology found in the fingertip. The sensory membrane is extended onto an object, conforming to its surface. Experimental results are presented which show the detection of shapes using particle velocimetry and papillae density analysis. These are preliminary results which show the potential of the WormTIP, which is the focus of ongoing work. The device is aimed for use as a self-contained palpating sensor, or as an attachment to a bio-inspired robotic worm forming a self-contained exploratory vehicle with the device acting as the sensory appendage or proboscis.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: The study was to assess the influence of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) with disc herniation on the range of passive and active movements in the hip joints. There are undoubtful biomechanical interdependences between hip joints and lumbar spine present also in pathological states. Recognition of those relationships could influence therapeutic procedures. Material and methods: Study material consisted of 160 randomly assigned patients suffering from lumbar DDD with disc herniation and radicular pain syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by spinal MRI in every case. Passive and active movements in the hip joint on the side of radicular pain and on the opposite side were assessed with hand goniometer. The measurement of muscle strength in the hip joint was performed with use of chair measuring apparatus. Condition of hip joints was assessed by radiological examinations. Results were sorted according to the body side and duration of radicular pain syndrome as well as the level of lumbar hernia Results: On the side of radicular pain there was decrease in range of passive extension (on average 10.85° at the painful side and 13.25° on the opposite side) and active extension (8.41° and 10.15°, respectively) as well as in range of passive abduction (33.1° and 36.4°, respectively). Muscle strength of hip joint abductors was significantly lower on the side of radicular syndrome (126.5 N on the side of radicular syndrome and 151 N on the opposite side, p < 0.0001). Osteophytes on the acetabular edge were more frequent and larger on the side of radicular syndrome - they were present in 37% of persons and their mean size was 4.9 mm in comparison to the respective values of 23% and 2.6 mm on the opposite side. Conclusions: 1. Lumbar DDD with disc herniation decreases range of movements in the hip joints. 2. Decrease in range of movement and muscle strength in the hip is observed on the side of radicular pain syndrome and increases with duration of the syndrome. These facts confirm pathogenic influence of lumbar DDD with disc herniation on the hip joint function and structure.

TI  - Wrist activity monitor counts are correlated with dynamic but not static assessments of arm elevation exposure made with a triaxial accelerometer
PY  - 2012
AB  - There is evidence in the literature of a link between workplace arm elevation exposure and atraumatic shoulder injuries. However, there are several methods that can be used to assess this exposure. The goal of the present study was to compare the outcomes of an activity monitor attached to the wrist and a triaxial accelerometer mounted on the humerus. Twenty-one workers wore both sensors over the course of a full workday. While the activity monitor data was not significantly correlated with any static humeral parameters, it was strongly correlated with all dynamic parameters. The use of a simple, commercially available activity monitor might offer an inexpensive alternative for the assessment of a large number of subjects over multiple workdays to determine the relationship between dynamic motion and occupation shoulder injuries in the future.

TI  - Wrist and digital joint motion produce unique flexor tendon force and excursion in the canine forelimb
PY  - 1999
AB  - The force and excursion within the canine digital flexor tendons were measured during passive joint manipulations that simulate those used during rehabilitation after flexor tendon repair and during active muscle contraction, simulating the active rehabilitation protocol. Tendon force was measured using a small buckle placed upon the tendon while excursion was measured using a suture marker and video analysis method. Passive finger motion imposed with the wrist flexed resulted in dramatically lower tendon force (similar to 5 N) compared to passive motion imposed with the wrist extended (similar to 17 N). Lower excursions were seen at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint with the wrist flexed (similar to 1.5 mm) while high excursion was observed when the wrist was extended or when synergistic finger and wrist motion were imposed (similar to 3.5 mm). Bivariate discriminant analysis of both force and excursion data revealed a natural clustering of the data into three general mechanical paradigms. With the wrist extended and with either one finger or four fingers manipulated, tendons experienced high loads of similar to 1500 g and high excursions of similar to 3.5 mm. In contrast, the same manipulations performed with the wrist flexed resulted in low tendon forces (4-8 N) and low tendon excursions of similar to 1.5 mm. Synergistic wrist and finger manipulation provided the third paradigm where tendon force was relatively low (similar to 4 N) but excursion was as high as those seen in the groups which were manipulated with the wrist extended. Active muscle contraction produced a modest tendon excursion(similar to 1 mm) and high or low tendon force with the wrist extended or flexed, respectively. These data provide the basis for experimentally testable hypotheses with regard to the factors that most significantly affect functional recovery after digital flexor tendon injury and define the normal mechanical operating characteristics of these tendons.

TI  - Wrist position sense acuity and its relation to motor dysfunction in children with developmental coordination disorder
PY  - 2018
AB  - This study obtained objective measures of wrist position sense to verify that children with DCD have proprioceptive deficits. In addition, it examined the relationship of wrist proprioceptive impairment with fine motor and balance function. Twenty children with DCD and thirty typically developing children (TD) aged 10-11 years old were recruited and screened using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2). The DCD group had total MABC-2 score below 5th percentile, and TD group was above 25th percentile. Wrist position sense was assessed under two conditions: 1) an ipsilateral wrist joint position matching requiring active movement to reproduce a reference position, and 2) a psychophysical discrimination threshold testing, in which the wrist joint was passively rotated. The results showed that, in comparison to TD controls, the DCD group showed an increased joint position error variability during active matching (p < 0.05) and highly elevated mean position sense threshold for passive displacement (+71%; p < 0.001). Position sense threshold data correlated significantly with manual dexterity (r = -0.4) and balance scores (r = -0.5). This study documents that DCD is associated with a proprioceptive dysfunction of the wrist/hand complex, which likely contributes to the fine motor problems in children with DCD.

TI  - Wrist rehabilitation with manipulator to perform passive and active exercises
PY  - 2019
AB  - The paper characterizes basic dysfunctions and diseases of a human wrist as well as describes the mechanics and pathomorphology of the human hand. The radial-carpal joint was analyzed in terms of its ranges of motion. The results of the analysis, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom for a free hand, are included. The concept of manipulator construction for optimal rehabilitation of the wrist was developed. Expected effects of the exercises, which can be implemented on the designed manipulator, were also described. A comparative analysis of other appliances supporting the rehabilitation of the human upper limb were presented. The main purpose of the designed manipulator was to gain full control of implementation of exercises performed by the patient and to archive and precisely track the progress in the rehabilitation. An important feature of the designed manipulator is its versatility enabling its use for: exercises of both hands (left and right) with the repetitive movements, choose of exercises (active and passive movements), choose of the degree of disability of the patient. © 2019, Czech Medical Association J.E.

AB  - Background. The term frozen shoulder refers to an inflammatory condition characterized by pain and reduced range of passive and active motion of the shoulder. Initial management is mostly conservative. In some cases, however, invasive treatment is necessary. Given the dearth of available data on long-term operative outcomes, it appears interesting to present a comprehensive discussion of this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of range of motion and function of the affected shoulder after a minimum of two-year follow-up following arthroscopic capsular release of idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder. Material and methods. The study enrolled 30 patients with frozen shoulder, including 16 patients with idiopathic FS and 14 patients with posttraumatic frozen shoulder. All patients had an anteroinferior capsular release and three additionally had a posterior capsulotomy. After a minimum of two-years of follow-up, the shoulder's range of motion and limb function were evaluated according to a modified version of the Constant-Murley Score (0-75), the ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) score and a subjective scale designed by the authors. Results. The improvement in the range of motion after arthroscopic capsular release was considerable and statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to pre-operative values both intraoperatively and after a minimum of two years of followup in both groups and across all planes of movement tested. The improvement of function of the shoulder after a minimum two years following arthroscopic capsular release was significant (p<0.05) according to the Constant-Murley score (from 19.3 preoperatively to 65.9 postoperatively, 0-75) and the ASES score (from 22.8 preoperatively to 92.7 postoperatively, 0-100). Conclusion. Arthroscopic capsular release significantly improved the range of motion and function in idiopathic and posttraumatic frozen shoulder. © MEDSPORTPRESS.

TI  - Xenon for tunnelling analysis of the efflux pump component OprN.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Tripartite efflux pumps are among the main actors responsible for antibiotics resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. In the last two decades, structural studies gave crucial information about the assembly interfaces and the mechanistic motions. Thus rigidifying the assembly seems to be an interesting way to hamper the drug efflux. In this context, xenon is a suitable probe for checking whether small ligands could act as conformational lockers by targeting hydrophobic cavities. Here we focus on OprN, the outer membrane channel of the MexEF efflux pump from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After exposing OprN crystals to xenon gas pressure, 14 binding sites were observed using X-ray crystallography. These binding sites were unambiguously characterized in hydrophobic cavities of OprN. The major site is observed in the sensitive iris-like region gating the channel at the periplasmic side, built by the three key-residues Leu 405, Asp 109, and Arg 412. This arrangement defines along the tunnel axis a strong hydrophobic/polar gradient able to enhance the passive efflux mechanism of OprN. The other xenon atoms reveal strategic hydrophobic regions of the channel scaffold to target, with the aim to freeze the dynamic movements responsible of the open/close conformational equilibrium in OprN.

TI  - You're Not Born with Talent Talented Girls' and Boys' Perceptions of Their Talents as Football Players
PY  - 2016
AB  - Generally in sports, there is a strong assumption of a connection between skill level in young age and adulthood. Studies have mainly focused on the coaches' understanding and role in identifying and developing talent. In this article we turn our attention towards the athletes' perspectives, interviewing talented young football players (five boys and five girls) about their perceptions of their own talent and development. The objective of the article is to investigate how boys and girls perceive their talent and to discuss how various perceptions influence coaching practice in talent development. We introduce the following questions: (a) do the players use a static or dynamic perception of their own talent and (b) do the players consider specific or general skills to be most important in their skill development? Results show that the boys have a more static perception of talent compared to the girls. Furthermore, the boys in this study stress the importance of highly specified skills. The girls have a more balanced view on what is important, but tend to stress the importance of basic skills. The study suggests two potential implications. First, the coaches should be aware of the possible vulnerability following players' static perception of talent. Second, an exclusive focus on specified skills might make for less optimal preparation for the changing demands young players meet when moving through the different levels of play on their way to high level football. In future research it would be interesting to investigate how players with a lower skill level, not yet regarded as talent, perceive their talent and skill development.

People do not think about the fact that they are constantly making informal presentations and that many of the same skills can be applied. Every team meeting, every discussion with peers, and every interaction between supervisor and subordinate is a potential presentation. Everyone can greatly enhance his or her effectiveness by applying many of the formal presentation and training techniques to these informal situations. Formal techniques, such as making eye contact, active versus passive learning, question asking, using visuals and active listening, are discussed.

TI  - Young children's spatial representations developed through exploration of a desktop virtual reality scene
PY  - 2000
AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) technology seems to offer the opportunity of designing 3D worlds and navigation activities which provide settings that are close to children's everyday experiences, capitalising on their enthusiasm for videogame-like technologies. This paper describes how different types of exploration of a VR scene by 6 y-old children affected their performance in a series of spatial tasks. Individual children explored a desktop virtual world where we varied both the visual perspective on the VR scene (route vs. survey view) and the level of exploration control (active vs. passive movement). We measured children's knowledge of the spatial layout of the environment through their memory of objects' location in the virtual scene and through the analysis of their wayfinding abilities within the scene. The results indicate that children were able to develop and display different levels of allocentric knowledge about the virtual world depending on the way they had familiarized with it and on the characteristics of the task demands. This finding contributes to inform the design of VR technologies aimed at supporting or evaluating spatial abilities in children of this age. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The complete system in the year 1893 comprised 68 pieces of apparatus consisting of 35 apparatuses for active movements, 9 apparatuses for balancing exercises and passive movements, 13 apparatuses for mechanical actions (vibration, tapotement, petrissage, effleurage and deep massage) and 11 orthopaedic apparatuses for the correction of spinal curvatures. At first this system received great approbation and throughout the world medico-mechanical institutes were opened. But it turned out to be too costly, rigid and insensitive to be a permanent success and was replaced by the 'old' remedial gymnasts.

TI  - Zonation of Ca2+ transport and enzyme activity in the caeca of rainbow trout - a simple structure with complex functions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Trout caeca are vermiform structures projecting from the anterior intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite their simple gross morphology, these appendages are physically distinct along the anterior-posterior axis, and ultrastructural evidence suggests zonation of function within the structures. Individual caeca from three sections (anterior, middle and posterior) were removed from the intestine of freshwater rainbow trout and investigated for ion transport and enzyme activity. Ca2+ absorption appeared as a combination of active and passive movement, with Michaelis-Menten kinetics observable under symmetrical conditions, and was inhibited by several pharmacological agents (ouabain, La3+ and a calmodulin antagonist). There was a decrease in ion transport function from adjacent to the intestine (proximal) to the distal tip of each caecum, along with decreasing transport from anterior to posterior for the proximal portion alone. Feeding increased the J(Max) and K-M for Ca2+ absorption within all sections, whereas ion-poor water (IPW) exposure further increased the J(Max) and K-M for Ca2+ transport in the anterior and middle sections. Increased Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and citrate synthase (CS) activity rates paralleled trends seen in Ca2+ transport. Feeding in freshwater and IPW exposure increased the glycolytic capacity of the caeca via increased pyruvate kinase (PK) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, while amino acid metabolism increased with IPW exposure through increased glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. Overall, feeding and IPW exposure each altered ionoregulation within the caeca of freshwater rainbow trout in a zone-specific pattern, with the anterior and proximal portions of the caeca being most affected. Increased carbohydrate and protein metabolism fueled the increased ATP demand of NKA through CS.

TI  - Zone I and II flexor tendon laceration in children
PY  - 1999
AB  - Aim of the study The goals of this study is to determine the effect of post-operative management as optimum period of post-operative immobilization, type of immobilization and importance of early mobilization program in zone I and II flexor tendon laceration in children.Material Thirty-seven patients who had sustained flexor tendon lacerations of 42 digits in zone I or ii were available for critical evaluation. Inclusion criteria were primary flexor tendon repairs in children under 15 years: lesions of flexor pollicis longus, digits with crush injuries, skin loss or revascularization were omitted from this study. The average post-operative follow-up was 3 years (range 12-89 months). Flexor tendon repair had been performed on 9 index, 14 middle, 9 ring and 10 small fingers. Tendon laceration occurred in zone I in 16 fingers, zone II in 26. Patients were divided into three groups: 0 to 5 years, 5 to 10 years and 11 to 15 years.Methods Immediate primary suture with modified Kessler technique was performed on the day of injury. Post-operative treatment included the use of an early passive motion program in 11 digits. The remaining 31 digits were managed by immobilization in a cast or splint for 4-6 weeks without early mobilization.

TI  - Zone I and II flexor tendon laceration in children [Plaies des tendons flechisseurs de l'enfant en zone I et II]
PY  - 1999
AB  - Aim of the study. The goals of this study is to determine the effect of post-operative management as optimun period of post-operative immobilization, type of immobilization and importance of early mobilization program in zone I and II flexor tendon laceration in children. Material. Thirty-seven patients who had sustained flexor tendon lacerations of 42 digits in zone I or II were available for critical evaluation. Inclusion criteria were primary flexor tendon repairs in children under 15 years: lesions of flexor pollicis longus, digits with crush injuries, skin loss or revascularization were omitted from this study. The average post-operative follow-up was 3 years (range 12-89 months). Flexor tendon repair had been performed on 9 index, 14 middle, 9 ring and 10 small fingers. Tendon laceration occurred in zone I in 16 fingers, zone II in 26. Patients were divided into three groups: 0 to 5 years, 5 to 10 years and 11 to 15 years. Methods. Immediate primary suture with modified Kessler technique was performed on the day of injury. Post- operative treatment included the use of an early passive motion program in 11 digits. The remaining 31 digits were managed by immobilization in a cast or splint for 4-6 weeks without early mobilization. The percentage of normal digital function that was recovered following flexor tendon repair was determined by a computation of total active motion (TAM) as described by Glogovac and Strickland (TAM = PIP active flexion + DIP active flexion- extension deficit/175). Data were analysed to determine the effect of age, the effect of early passive motion program, the effect of varying periods of post repair immobilization and the effect of the type of immobilization. Results. Tendon ruptures were identified in four digits. One was in a non cooperative patient who removed splint immobilization after two weeks post- repair. The three remaining patients were immobilized with a short splint. Isolated or combined profundus and superficialis repairs achieved comparable results when managed with an early passive motion or with simple immobilization without early motion program. Immobilization for 5 or 6 weeks resulted in an appreciable deterioration of function (TAM = 86 p. 100) in comparizon with 4 weeks immobilization (TAM = 93 p. 100) (p > 0.05). CompliCation rate as rupture is higher in the group immobilized with a short splint, espacially when children is under five. Discussion. Primary flexor tendon repairs in children in this series achived satisfactory functional results in comparizon with adults. There is however, in the very young, some widely differing results since the necessity of post operative care was not fully appreciated. Immobilization with a short splint should be avoided because of greater complication rate as rupture, especially in very young. We found no benefit of early passive mobilization protocols. Immobilization should not be extend beyond 4 weeks because of deterioration of final functional result.

TI  - Zone II Flexor Tendon Therapy: Mobilize or Immobilize?
PY  - 1989
AB  - This study investigated the postoperative management approaches used in the treatment of flexor tendon repairs in Zone II of the hand. The therapists and the hand surgeons who treat patients with acute hand injuries in the Metropolitan Toronto area were surveyed to detect their current practice trends and preferences in flexor tendon postoperative management. The survey focused on the following four protocols: 1. immobilization for at least three weeks, 2. the Kleinert program of controlled active motion, 3. the Duran program of controlled passive motion, and 4. combination of controlled active and passive motion. Although the results suggested that mobilization is the preferred postoperative management amongst the majority of responding therapists and hand surgeons, the type of mobilization program preferred differed. The therapists demonstrated a trend towards a combination of early controlled active and passive motion; whereas, the trend amongst the surgeons was that of early controlled active motion. The decision to use one specific management approach over another was found to be very “patient specific”. As well, a wide variation on the preferences given for the splinting positions at the wrist, metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) joint, and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint was noted. © 1989, Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT).

TI  - Zone-II Flexor Tendon Repair: A Randomized Prospective Trial of Active Place-and-Hold Therapy Compared with Passive Motion Therapy
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: In order to improve digit motion after zone-II flexor tendon repair, rehabilitation programs have promoted either passive motion or active motion therapy. To our knowledge, no prospective randomized trial has compared the two techniques. Our objective was to compare the results of patients treated with an active therapy program and those treated with a passive motion protocol following zone-II flexor tendon repair.Methods: Between January 1996 and December 2002, 103 patients (119 digits) with zone-II flexor tendon repairs were randomized to either early active motion with place and hold or a passive motion protocol. Range of motion was measured at six, twelve, twenty-six, and fifty-two weeks following repair. Dexterity tests were performed, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) outcome questionnaire and a satisfaction score were completed at fifty-two weeks by ninety-three patients (106 injured digits).Results: At all time points, patients treated with the active motion program had greater interphalangeal joint motion. At the time of the final follow-up, the interphalangeal joint motion in the active place-and-hold group was a mean (and standard deviation) of 156 degrees +/- 25 degrees compared with 128 degrees +/- 22 degrees (p < 0.05) in the passive motion group. The active motion group had both significantly smaller flexion contractures and greater satisfaction scores (p < 0.05). We could identify no difference between the groups in terms of the DASH scores or dexterity tests. When the groups were stratified, those who were smokers or had a concomitant nerve injury or multiple digit injuries had less range of motion, larger flexion contractures, and decreased satisfaction scores compared with patients without these comorbidities. Treatment by a certified hand therapist resulted in better range of motion with smaller flexion contractures. Two digits in each group had tendon ruptures following repair.Conclusions: Active motion therapy provides greater active finger motion than passive motion therapy after zone-II flexor tendon repair without increasing the risk of tendon rupture. Concomitant nerve injuries, multiple digit injuries, and a history of smoking negatively impact the final outcome of tendon repairs.

TI  - Zooplankton can actively adjust their motility to turbulent flow
PY  - 2017
AB  - Calanoid copepods are among the most abundant metazoans in the ocean and constitute a vital trophic link within marine food webs. They possess relatively narrow swimming capabilities, yet are capable of significant self-locomotion under strong hydrodynamic conditions. Here we provide evidence for an active adaptation that allows these small organisms to adjust their motility in response to background flow. We track simultaneously and in three dimensions the motion of flow tracers and planktonic copepods swimming freely at several intensities of quasi-homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. We show that copepods synchronize the frequency of their relocation jumps with the frequency of small-scale turbulence by performing frequent relocation jumps of low amplitude that seem unrelated to localized hydrodynamic signals. We develop a model of plankton motion in turbulence that shows excellent quantitative agreement with our measurements when turbulence is significant. We find that, compared with passive tracers, active motion enhances the diffusion of organisms at low turbulence intensity whereas it dampens diffusion at higher turbulence levels. The existence of frequent jumps in a motion that is otherwise dominated by turbulent transport allows for the possibility of active locomotion and hence to transition from being passively advected to being capable of controlling diffusion. This behavioral response provides zooplankton with the capability to retain the benefits of self-locomotion despite turbulence advection and may help these organisms to actively control their distribution in dynamic environments. Our study reveals an active adaptation that carries strong fitness advantages and provides a realistic model of plankton motion in turbulence.

TI  - Zum Problem der gegenseitigen Beeinflussung der Ionenfluxe am Myokard
PY  - 1964
AB  - 1. In non-beating frog atria the potassium exchange as a function of temperature and the sodium exchange as effected by replacing Li or sucrose for Na in the extracellular fluid were measured, using the isotopes K42 and Na24. 2. In addition to these measurements, the membrane potential (by intracellular electrodes), the intracellular concentrations of K and Na (by flame photometry), and the energy expenditure (from oxygen consumption) were determined. 3. For K influx a mean Q10 of 2,1 and for K efflux a mean Q10 of 1,5 was found. Assuming a passive movement of K ions in the efflux but a passive and an active component in the K influx, and further assuming a Q10 of 1,5 for the passive ion movement in efflux and influx and a Q10 of 4 for the active K inward transport, a ratio of 0,6:0,4 between the passive and the active component in the influx can be calculated. Since influx and efflux are equal under steady state conditions, the ratio of the passive influx to the efflux is p=0,6. 4. This result is compared to the equation of Ussing (1949a) where the ratio of the passive influx to the efflux is expressed as a function of membrane potential and the extracellular and intracellular K concentrations. A numerical value q=0,89 of this ratio results. 5. The discrepancy between p and q may suggest that the theoretical assumptions of the Ussing relation are not valid. The main assumption is the independence of ion movements in passive influx and efflux. It is proposed that an interaction between efflux and influx exists, in the sense of a mutual obstruction of the two fluxes, possibly by way of a single-file-mechanism as proposed by Hodgkin and Keynes (1955 b) in giant axons. 6. The Na24 efflux from the cells in freshly dissected preparations is reversibly reduced to about 2/3 when the Na in the bathing solution is replaced by Li or sucrose for short periods. Simultaneously the membrane potential is slightly decreased. 7. The reduction of Na efflux under Li or sucrose can be explained, if 1/3 of the Na exchange of resting frog atria is a Na exchange diffusion. This agrees qualitatively with the suggestion of Ussing (1949 b) and the findings of Keynes and Swan (1959) on frog muscle. 8. The energy available from metabolism in resting preparations under normal conditions amounts to 18 cal/kg myocardium (wet weight) · min. On the other hand, the energy required for the Na efflux would be 11,3 cal/kg · min, if all Na efflux is active transport. The energy needed for the Na efflux is markedly reduced, if part of the efflux uses exchange diffusion. This seems to support the hypothesis of an exchange diffusion. © 1964 Springer-Verlag.

PY  - 1990
AB  - The flux through the dentin tubuli is at the origin of the hydrodynamic theory of tooth sensitivity. After a review of the various in vivo techniques reported in the literature, this study describes an original method of dentin perfusion--so called "push-pull" and specific to this topic. With this technique, the authors have demonstrated the kinetics of this flux, as well as the effect of some factors (age, colchicine, ouabain), on transdentinal fluid exchanges. The analysis of all these results suggests that a combination of active and passive movements could be at the origin of this flux, the temporary inhibition of which could present major advantages in current Periodontics practice.

There was no significant difference between the two therapies in relation to weightbearing pain, night pain, pain during active and passive movement; or in relation to the improvement in knee flexion or hip abduction. The overall judgement of effectiveness by both patient and doctor showed no significant difference between the two groups. The incidence of side effects was low without significant difference between the two patient groups. Sulindac is considered a useful therapeutic addition to the range of preparations presently available for the treatment of the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

PY  - 1990
AB  - Twenty patients (2 males, 18 females, age range 33-69, average 55.85 years) with diagnoses of variously localized osteoarthritis (18 cases) or acute joint pain (2 cases) were studied. All patients were given one 1-g tablet of nabumetone every evening before going to bed, for 8 days. In three cases treatment was withdrawn immediately after the first dose due to the onset of allergic (2 cases) or dyspeptic (1 case) symptoms. Initially, all patients complained of considerable pain, both at rest and during active and passive movements with correlated functional limitation of the joints involved. Treatment resulted in considerable subsidence of symptoms from the very first days of therapy. Statistical calculation of the score showed significant improvement. Parameters of tolerability did not show significant changes from baseline. Local tolerability was generally good. The fact of the single daily dose has certainly contributed to the patients' good compliance.

PY  - 2015
AB  - The current study investigates auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and mismatch negativity (MMN) during active and passive discrimination of stationary and moving sound stimuli presented according to the oddball paradigm. Standard stimuli represented stationary midline sounds. Deviant stimuli simulated sound source location shifts (to the left/right from head midline) produced by linear or stepwise changes of interaural time delay (ITD). The event-related responses were evaluated by peak amplitudes of N1 waves and mean amplitudes of MMN, P3a, P3b and reorienting negativity (RON) components. The N1 amplitude was larger in active than in passive conditions, and was unaffected by spatial dynamic changes of the deviant stimuli. The deviant motion pattern (smooth or stepwise) affected only MMN and RON obtained in passive listening conditions. Abrupt deviant displacement elicited larger MMN and RON components than smooth motion. Drawing listeners' attention to the deviant stimuli resulted in suppression of MMN/RON sensitivity to auditory motion pattern.

PY  - 2015
AB  - The spectral dynamics of the EEG rhythmicity during active and passive discrimination of stationary and moving sound stimuli presented according to the oddball paradigm were investigated. Standard stimuli represented stationary midline sounds. Deviant stimuli simulated smooth and stepwise sound source motion (to the left/right from head midline) produced by linear and stepwise changes of interaural time delay. Significant changes of the brain oscillations were found in the frequency range of 3-30 Hz. The dynamics of the moving deviant stimuli (smooth vs. stepwise) had greater impact on theta-rhythm power in active listening conditions: a stronger theta-power increase was evoked by the stepwise sound motion as compared to smooth motion. Significant increase in theta-power was also observed with rightward sound displacement as compared to leftward displacements. Active deviant discrimination reduced alpha-power (8-11 Hz) mostly during smooth deviant motion. The power increase of lower alpha-oscillations (12-15 Hz) was stronger with step- wise motion than with smooth motion of deviants. The interhemispheric asymmetry of beta-power decrease in active conditions (as compared to passive) was found in the whole beta-range. The sup- pression of beta-power was stronger at the right hemisphere than at the midline or left hemisphere and showed no dependence on spatial properties of the deviant stimuli. This asymmetry may be related to selective attention to task-relevant sounds and with preparation to motor response. Generally, active auditory discrimination resulted in stronger deviant-related changes of the wide-ranged EEG spectral power than passive discrimination with attentional tuning to task-irrelevant stimuli.

PY  - 1996
AB  - A chronic cyst of the acromioclavicular joint was treated in 3 patients who were followed up for an average period of 26 months. All three were over 60 years old and presented with a massive rupture of the rotator cuff with a subnormal range of passive motion; active motion was variably affected and was painful. The patients underwent resection of one cm of the lateral end of the clavicle, together with resection of the cyst and synovectomy of the upper part of the pathologic humero-acromial joint; the coraco-acromial ligament was left in place. With a mean follow-up of 26 months, the 3 patients have significant pain relief and no cyst has recurred. The authors propose a mechanism to explain the persistence of the cysts in patients with massive rotator cuff tear: elevation of the arm brings the humeral head upwards and forces synovial fluid into the acromioclavicular joint through a perforation in the frayed capsule; this communication is later obstructed by synovial fringes which prevent drainage of the fluid. Excision of the synovium cures the problem.

AB  - A dynamic model of the middle ear and mastoid system was designed in order to evaluate basic principles in tympanometry. The model allows controlled simulation of the exact changes in the ear drum's mass and in intratympanic volume and pressure. The contribution of each of these factors to acoustic impedance was measured. We found that the volume values of static, acoustic compliance were equal to the volume of air in a closed cell. There was good correlation between direct measurement of air pressure in the model cell and indirect pressure measurement by tympanometry. We also demonstrated a difference between mechanical displacement of the drum and its displacement by negative pressure. This demonstration of tympanometry using a middle-ear compatible model enables us to understand its principles and helps in the education of students.

It was found that "impingement syndrome" is characteristic for periarthritis humeroscapularis simplex. Active and passive movement restriction of the shoulder was frequently observed in periarthritis humeroscapularis simplex acuta; passive one greater than 50% was typical for capsulitis adhesiva. Crepitus at the movements, muscle wasting, impingement syndrome pain at the abduction and external rotation against resistance is indicative of periarthritis humeroscapularis destructive. Sonographic assessment of the shoulder is recommended in every case with the biceps long head rupture suspicion.

PY  - 2012
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacies for open reduction and internal fixation of unstable periarticular fractures of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) with the AO miniature plate system.METHODS: A total of 265 patients (172 males and 93 females) with 302 MCP periarticular fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Their mean age was 32.5 years old (range: 17 - 59). The standard internal fixation treatment method was established on the basis of the AO/ASIF Comprehensive Classification of Fractures. A "T" shape plate, double-row-plate or a condylar plate was used for A2, A3, C1, C2 type fractures. Screws alone were used for B type fractures. Active and passive flexion and extension exercises at Day 3 post-operation within the limits of patient pain tolerance. All patients were evaluated regarding the total active motion (TAM) score, average PROM, quick-DASH score, the power of gripping, pinching and Kapandji score.RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 4.6 months (range: 4 - 24). Radiological examinations showed that the fracture line disappeared in an average of 8.2 weeks (average: 8.2). According to TAM rating criteria, the functions of hands were as follows: excellent (n = 113), good (n = 136) and poor (n = 53). The fair rate was 82.8%. The average PROM of MP joint was 82.3° ± 4.7° and the average quick-DASH score 17.4. Contrast to the health side, the power of gripping recovered for 94.5% and pinching for 88.6%. The Kapandji score was 90%. A total of 103 MCP (34.1%) completely recovered. Contrasting between the head of metacarpal fracture combined the base of proximal phalangeal fracture and alone the head of metacarpal fracture or the base of proximal phalangeal fracture, the post-operative rates of complications and tendon adhesion were higher. As compared with traditional methods, each of the above parameters had statistic significances (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Because of complex anatomic structures, the MCP periarticular fractures have such complications as tendon adhesion, joint stiffness and post-traumatic arthritis, etc. The traditional treatment method is less effective. The AO miniplate and screw system provides rigid and stable fixation so that it is a preferred technique in the treatment of MCP periarticular fractures.

TI  - [Are Interlimb Interactions Disturbed in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: a Study in Unloading Condition?]
PY  - 2016
AB  - During natural human locomotion neural connections characteristic for the control of quadrupedal walking are activated. The degree of interaction between the neural networks generating rhythmic movements of the upper and lower extremities, depends on the tonic state of each of these networks, adjustable by motor command in the brain. The distortion of such command in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may lead to disturbance of interlimb interactions. In conditions of arms and legs unloading in 17 patients with PD and 16 healthy subjects investigated the effect of limb movement of one girdle on the parameters of motor activity of the limbs of the other girdle in their combined cyclic movements. In patients the weakening of influences of active or passive arm movements, and active movements of the distal parts of the arms on voluntary leg movements was shown, while in healthy subjects the effect of arm movements on the parameters of voluntary movements was significant. The effect of arm movements on the possibility of involuntary activation of air- stepping by vibratory stimulation of the leg muscles in patients was absent, while in healthy subjects the motor activity of the arms increased the opportunity of involuntary rhythm activation. The differences in the influence of leg movements to the rhythmic movement of the upper extremities in patients and healthy subjects were revealed. The medication exhibited interlimb interaction, but it was insufficient for normalization of the state of neural networks in patients. It is concluded that in patients with PD, neural networks generating stepping rhythm are in a state of heightened tonic activity. This does not allow not only activating involuntary rhythmic movements, but also showing facilitation effect with arms to legs.

TI  - [Arthroscopic synovectomy in chronic inflammatory rheumatism: clinical and functional aspects].
PY  - 2003
AB  - By now many authors regard arthroscopic synovectomy an integral part of therapeutic treatment of many rheumatic diseases with favourable results on post operating course and clinical picture in the long term. The pathologic synovial tissue during articular inflammatory rheumatism is well known to have a damaging effect responsible of early cartilage injury, as well as symptomatic action (e.g. articular stiffness, effusion, pain, functional limitation). Therefore to value the removal of such a tissue you should think of the secondary prevention of cartilage injury, besides the symptomatic point of view. Since 1996 we performed 190 arthroscopic synovectomy, the adopted criteria of judgement were: pain (spontaneous, during active and passive movements), effusion or swelling presence, articular range and cartilage state (evaluated during arthroscopy according to Outerbridg's classification). 70% of the cases showed good results and six years later the beginning of this activity we retain arthroscopic synovectomy as a valid help in articular inflammatory rheumatism treatment.

PY  - 1990
AB  - The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of the beta-cyclodextrin-piroxicam (beta CDP) complex was assessed in a randomized single-blind controlled parallel study vs nabumetone (NAB). Forty patients, 18 men and 22 women aged 18 to 65 and suffering from chronic osteoarthritis, were treated. Both drugs were orally administered, once a day in the morning, for 4 consecutive weeks. PI and SPID, evaluated for 24 hours following the first drug administration, showed a quicker onset of the analgesic action of beta CDP, with statistically significant differences between treatments (p less than 0.05). In the medium-term treatment, beta CDP proved to be more effective on joint swelling, spontaneous pain, pain on passive movement and functional limitation. Both treatments were well tolerated but a higher gastro-intestinal side-effect incidence was recorded in NAB group.

PY  - 1996
AB  - The case of a four-year old girl with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is reported. Primary clinical examination revealed bilateral passive elbow flexion only 0-20-70 without active elbow flexion. A two-stage operative procedure was chosen for both sides. At first an elbow arthrolysis was performed with subsequent intensive physiotherapy. In a second session we performed a bipolar transposition of the latissimus dorsi as a myocutaneous flap. The patient was first operated on the left and afterwards on the right side. By this procedure, the patient achieved a significant improvement of both passive and active elbow flexion mobility. The range of active motion was 0-30-90 and 0-40-90 degrees.

TI  - [Biomechanical principles of after-care in replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament].
PY  - 1994
AB  - The patellar tendon graft replacing the anterior cruciate ligament undergoes histomorphological and biomechanical changes. From literature we can estimate a force of 200 N to be a critical limit of graft load after ACL-plasty in humans. The comparison with the graft loads under various conditions provided the following conclusions: Unlimited passive motion of the knee joint can be done without risk. Early weight bearing is possible. Active extension exercise against gravity could damage the graft in the range of 0 to 20 degrees of flexion in some patients. A rehabilitation protocol has to regard these biomechanical principles. In a prospective study 74 patients underwent rehabilitation according to the protocol described. An extension contracture of more than 10 degrees was seen in 9 patients. In all cases it was due to a notch-impingement or a cyclops. One year after operation 57 patients had a follow up. The side to side-difference in anterior drawer measured with a KT-1000-arthrometer was less than 2 mm in 45 patients. Six patients had difference between 2 and 4 mm. In six patients the difference was more than 4 mm.

PY  - 2007
AB  - The stinger syndrome is a common neuropathy caused by traction or compression of the brachial plexus. In general, it is seen in young adults involved in sport activities and a major contact trauma is the rule. An 11-year-old boy with bilateral glenohumeral joint laxity had pain in the left shoulder, numbness and decreased strength in the left arm that developed after striking against a wall while running, with the left shoulder in extension and the neck in minimal lateral flexion to the contralateral side. Physical examination showed extreme anteroinferior passive translocation of the humeral head in neutral rotation and a positive sulcus sign in the left shoulder. The diagnosis was made as brachial plexus neuropathy (stinger syndrome) resulting from traction trauma and shoulder joint laxity and a shoulder-arm brace was applied. After two weeks, atrophy was detected in the right deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles, and active and passive motion exercises of the shoulder were initiated. At the end of three months, he achieved normal range of motion of the shoulder and muscle strength.

TI  - [Case of painful muscle spasm induced by thoracic vertebral fracture: successful treatment with lumbar sympathetic ganglia block].
PY  - 2008
AB  - We report a 70-year-old man, who developed painful involuntary muscle contraction of the left leg after the lumbar discectomy, which exacerbated after a vertebral fracture of Th12. This involuntary movement was accompanied with the abnormal position of left leg simulating triple flexion response, and was induced by active or passive movement of his left knee and foot joints. Several drugs including benzodiazepines and dantrolene were ineffective, although treatment with baclofen or carbamazepine was effective. These findings suggest that hyperexcitability of the anterior horn cells following the disturbance of spinal inhibitory interneurons was involved. Electophysiological studies suggested the disturbance of left lumber nerve roots. The spinal root blocks from L3 to S1 were performed, after which the painful involuntary muscle spasm was resolved. The lumbar sympathetic ganglia block was also effective; suggesting that abnormal afferent neuronal input to spinal cord was caused by the nerve root trauma which triggered the formation of secondary abnormal network in the spine. Lumbar sympathetic ganglia block should be recommended to a therapeutic option for the refractory painful muscle spasm of the leg.

PY  - 2015
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate contrast-color sensitivity (CCS) of central vision, contrast-frequency sensitivity (CFS) and dynamic visual acuity (DVA) in healthy people and patients with ischemic optic neuropathy (ION).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed for 115 eyes with normal static visual acuity (1.0) in 111 healthy people; 25 patients (39 eyes) with acute anterior ION and 26 patients (26 eyes) with chronic ION. Assessment of static visual acuity and refraction as well as ophthalmoscopy of the eye fundus were performed.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Based on the data analysis of CFS, DVA and photometry of CCS, the quantitative estimation of age-related changing in light sensitivity and changing sensitivity of ill and healthy eyes of patients with acute and chronic ION has been carried out. The differences between changing of these functional parameters are used for discussion of the role of age-related changes of visual system hemodynamics in decreasing of light sensitivity. The possibility of usig the data of light sensitivity decreasing in the early diagnostics of visual system ischemic impairment is discussed.Цель исследования - оценка контрастно-цветовой чувствительности (КЦЧ) в центральной области поля зрения, контрастно-частотной чувствительности (КЧЧ) и динамической остроты зрения (ДОЗ) у здоровых и пациентов с ишемической оптической нейропатией (ИОН). Материал и методы. Исследование КЦЧ проведено для 115 глаз с нормальной (1,0) статической остротой зрения у 111 здоровых испытуемых; у 25 пациентов (39 глаз) с острой передней ИОН и 26 пациентов (26 глаз) с хронической ИОН. У всех испытуемых перед исследованием проводились оценка статической остроты зрения, рефракции, офтальмоскопия глазного дна. Результаты и заключение. На основании анализа показателей КЧЧ, ДОЗ и фотометрии КЦЧ проведена количественная оценка возрастных изменений световой чувствительности и чувствительности больных и здоровых глаз пациентов с острой и хронической ИОН. Установленные особенности изменений этих функциональных показателей зрения подтверждают роль нарушений гемодинамики в зрительной системе, связанных с возрастом, заболеваниями сосудов и ИОН, в снижении световой чувствительности. Обсуждается возможность использования данных о снижении световой чувствительности для ранней диагностики ишемических нарушений в зрительной системе.

TI  - [Changes of dynamic visual acuity after phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens implantation].
PY  - 2013
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the spatial resolutions of dynamic optotypes at different speed levels among age-related cataract patients, older people with clear crystalline lenses and senile individuals implanted with intraocular lenses (IOL).METHODS: The control study recruited 24 patients (48 eyes) with age-related cataract scheduled for phacoemulsification surgery in our hospital between Jul. 2011 and Dec. 2011 in the cataract group. Twenty-three older volunteers (46 eyes) with clear crystalline lenses were enrolled in the normal group. The postoperative group consisted of 23 contemporary cases implanted with spherical monofocal non-yellow-tinted IOL and followed up for 3 months postoperatively, of which 5 cases undertook unilateral surgery for normal visual acuity of the contralateral eye. Monocular and binocular best corrected visual acuity at static condition and binocular spatial resolution of optotypes at speeds of 15, 30, 60 and 90 degrees per second (dps) were measured by a logarithmic visual acuity chart. Statistical analysis was performed with student's t test (with Bonferroni correction).RESULTS: Binocular spatial resolutions at speeds of 15, 30, 60 and 90 dps were (0.29 ± 0.16), (0.34 ± 0.17), (0.47 ± 0.19) and (0.52 ± 0.17), respectively, in the cataract group, and (0.04 ± 0.06), (0.06 ± 0.06), (0.12 ± 0.09) and (0.15 ± 0.11), respectively, in the normal group. Resolution of dynamic optotypes at the four speed levels were statistically lower in the cataract group than in the normal group (t = -6.952, -7.558, -8.235, -8.737; P < 0.01). Velocity dependent spatial resolution changes manifested statistically higher values in the cataract group than in the normal group, with (0.14 ± 0.13) versus (0.03 ± 0.05) at the interval between static and 15 dps (t0-15 dps = -3.874, P = 0.001) and (0.13 ± 0.09) versus (0.06 ± 0.07) at the interval between 30 dps and 60 dps (t30-60 dps = -3.113, P = 0.003). In the postoperative group, resolutions of dynamic optotypes at speeds of 15, 30, 60 and 90 dps were (0.03 ± 0.05), (0.05 ± 0.07), (0.11 ± 0.10) and (0.16 ± 0.11), respectively. Dynamic visual acuities at all the four speed levels were statistically higher in the postoperative group than in the cataract group (t = -7.336, -7.673, -8.328, -8.583; P < 0.01) and compatible to that in the normal group (t = 0.669, 0.400, 0.372, -0.504; P > 0.05). Visual acuity differences between consecutive speed levels were comparable between the postoperative group and the normal group (t = 0.586, -0.326, 0.133, -1.600; P > 0.05), while at the interval between static and 15 dps and the interval between 30 dps and 60 dps, the postoperative group exhibited lower visual acuity changes than the cataract group, with (0.03 ± 0.04) versus (0.14 ± 0.13) (t0-15 dps = -4.182, P < 0.01) and (0.05 ± 0.06) versus (0.13 ± 0.09) (t30-60 dps = -3.334, P = 0.002), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: As the optotype's moving speed increased, spatial resolutions declined more rapidly in patients with age-related cataract. Phacoemulsification combined with IOL implantation could effectively restore the spatial resolution of dynamic optotypes.

TI  - [Clinical application of free perforator hypothenar flap for thumb pulp defect].
PY  - 2015
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the therapeutic effect of free perforator hypothenar flap for thumb pulp defect.METHODS: From Jun. 2012 to Mar. 2013,8 cases with thumb pulp defect accompanied with exposure of phalanges ans tendons were treated by free ipsilateral perforator hypothenar flap. The flaps were 1.4 cm x 2.0 cm-1.8 cm x 2.2 cm in size. Ulnar finger artery in the flap was anastomosed with thumb artery. The accompanied veins and superficial veins were respectively anastomosed with thumb dorsal veins. Nerve branches in flaps were sutured with unilateral finger nerve to reconstruct flap feeling with 9-0 thread. Wounds in the hypothenar donor site were sutured directly.RESULTS: All the flaps survived completely with primary healing both in donor and recipient area. 8 cases (8 fingers) were followed up for 6-13 months (average 9 months). The flaps appearance, texture were good. The two-point discrimination distance on flap was 7-10 mm. The active and passive movement of thumb joints was normal. There was no complain about the feeling at the donor site. Linear scar was left on the donor site. Patients hand grip strength was not decreased.CONCLUSIONS: The free perforator hypothenar flap which has constant vascular anatomy is a new method for thumb soft tissue defect with less morbidity to donor site. The operative procedures are relatively simple.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of reverse radial hypothenar flap for finger soft tissue defect.METHODS: From Mar. 2006 to Mar. 2010, 13 cases (14 fingers) with finger soft tissue defects were treated with reverse radial hypothenar flaps pedicled with ulnar palmar digital artery of little finger. The defects were 1.9 cm x 1.5 cm -4.0 cm x 2.0 cm in size. The flap size ranged from 1.5 cm x 2.0 cm to 4.0 cm x 2.0 cm.RESULTS: All the flaps survived completely with primary healing both in donor and recipient area. 12 cases (13 fingers) were followed up for 1-3 years. The flaps color was similar to the unaffected fingers. Cicatricial contracture happened in one case due to contracture of palmar fascia. The two-point discrimination distance on flap was 3.2-5.3mm. The active and passive movement of finger joints was evaluated as excellent in 12 fingers, good in one finger. There was no complaint about the feeling at the donor site. Two months after operation, all patients could go back to work.CONCLUSIONS: The reverse radial hypothenar flap is very suitable for finger soft tissue defect with less morbidity to donor site.

TI  - [Clinical effects of Archimedes sling system in the rehabilitation of knee joint flexion dysfunction after deep burn].
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective: To observe the therapeutic effects of Archimedes sling system in the rehabilitation of knee joint flexion dysfunction of patients after deep burns. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with knee joint flexion dysfunction after deep burn, conforming to the study criteria and hospitalized in Burn Rehabilitation Center of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University & Wuhan Third Hospital from March 2015 to December 2017, were recruited in this prospective controlled study. According to the order of admission, 18 odd-numbered patients and 19 even-numbered patients were enrolled in conventional treatment (CT) group [13 males and 5 females, aged (42±10) years] and sling treatment (ST) group [13 males and 6 females, aged (37±10) years] respectively. Patients in group CT were conventionally conducted with knee joint mobilization treatment, continuous passive motion treatment, and pressure therapy, while patients in group ST were conducted with supine knee joint flexion and extension training and micro-squat short arc resistance training with Archimedes sling system besides CT. Patients in the 2 groups were treated for 6 months, and 1 course of treatment was 1 month. Before treatment and after 6 months of treatment, the knee joint active motion range was measured and the difference value was calculated, the American Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee joint score was used to assess the functional disorder of patients, and the self-function satisfaction of patients were evaluated with modified Likert Scale. Data were processed with independent sample t test, paired sample t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) Before treatment, the difference value of knee joint active motion range of patients in group CT was (45±11)°, which was similar to (44±12)° in group ST (t=-0.206, P>0.05). After 6 months of treatment, the difference value of knee joint active motion range of patients in group ST was (89±14)°, which was obviously higher than (75±12)° in group CT (t=0.897, P<0.01). The difference values of knee joint active motion range of patients in groups CT and ST after 6 months of treatment were obviously higher than those before treatment (t=-13.394, -29.459, P<0.01). (2) Before treatment, the HSS knee joint score of patients in group CT was (40±10) points, which was similar to (36±11) points in group ST (t=0.816, P>0.05). After 6 months of treatment, the HSS knee joint score of patients in group ST was (68±13) points, which was obviously higher than (57±10) points in group CT (t=0.162, P<0.01). The HSS knee joint score of patients in groups CT and ST after 6 months of treatment were obviously higher than those before treatment (t=-12.410, -30.559, P<0.01). (3) Before treatment, the self-function satisfaction scores of patients in the two groups were similar (t=0.140, P>0.05). After 6 months of treatment, the self-function satisfaction score of patients in group ST was obviously higher than that in group CT (t=3.103, P<0.01). The self-function satisfaction scores of patients in groups CT and ST after 6 months of treatment were obviously higher than those before treatment (t=-11.697, -29.029, P<0.01). Conclusions: The Archimedes sling system can effectively increase the difference value of knee joint active motion range, alleviate the degree of knee joint dysfunction, and enhance the self-function satisfaction of patients on the basis of conventional rehabilitation treatment for patients with knee joint flexion dysfunction after deep burns.目的： 观察阿基米德悬吊系统对深度烧伤患者膝关节屈曲功能障碍的康复治疗效果。 方法： 2015年3月2017年12月，武汉大学同仁医院暨武汉市第三医院烧伤康复中心收治符合入选标准的37例深度烧伤后膝关节屈曲功能障碍住院患者，纳入本前瞻性对照研究。根据患者入院顺序编号，将18例奇数号、19例偶数号患者分别纳入常规治疗组[男13例、女5例，年龄(42±10)岁]和悬吊治疗组[男13例、女6例，年龄(37±10)岁]。常规治疗组患者常规进行膝关节关节松动治疗、持续被动运动器治疗以及压力治疗；悬吊治疗组患者在常规治疗的基础上，采用阿基米德悬吊系统进行仰卧位膝关节屈伸训练、阻力式微蹲短弧训练。2组患者均以1个月为1个疗程，治疗6个月。治疗前及治疗6个月后，测量患者的膝关节主动活动度并计算差值，采用美国特种外科医院(HSS)膝关节评分评估患者功能障碍程度，采用改良李克特量表评估患者自身功能满意度。对数据行独立样本t检验、配对样本t检验、chi(2)检验。 结果： (1)治疗前，常规治疗组患者膝关节主动活动度差值为(45±11)°，与悬吊治疗组的(44±12)°相近(t＝－0.206，P>0.05)；治疗6个月后，悬吊治疗组患者膝关节主动活动度差值为(89±14)°，明显大于常规治疗组的(75±12)°(t＝0.897，P<0.01)。常规治疗组、悬吊治疗组患者治疗6个月后膝关节主动活动度差值均明显大于治疗前(t＝－13.394、－29.459，P<0.01)。(2)治疗前，常规治疗组患者HSS膝关节评分为(40±10)分，与悬吊治疗组的(36±11)分相近(t＝0.816，P>0.05)；治疗6个月后，悬吊治疗组患者HSS膝关节评分为(68±13)分，明显高于常规治疗组的(57±10)分(t＝0.162，P<0.01)。常规治疗组、悬吊治疗组患者治疗6个月后HSS膝关节评分均明显高于治疗前(t＝－12.410、－30.559，P<0.01)。(3)治疗前，2组患者自身功能满意度评分相近(t＝0.140，P>0.05)；治疗6个月后，悬吊治疗组患者自身功能满意度评分明显高于常规治疗组(t＝3.103，P<0.01)。常规治疗组、悬吊治疗组患者治疗6个月后自身功能满意度评分均明显高于治疗前(t＝－11.697、－29.029，P<0.01)。 结论： 深度烧伤后膝关节屈曲功能障碍患者在常规康复治疗的基础上辅以阿基米德悬吊系统治疗能有效增加膝关节主动活动度差值，减轻膝关节功能障碍程度，提高患者对自身功能的满意度。.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of promoting knee joint rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a rehabilitation training instrument NEO-GAIT. Methods: Sixty patients who received TKA from January 2017 to July 2017 in the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University were randomly assigned to receive rehabilitation training with continuous passive motion (CPM) or NEO-GAIT with random number (30 cases in CPM group, included 8 males and 22 females; 30 cases in NEO-GAIT group, included 6 males and 24 females). The visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluation of pain, the postoperative range of motion (ROM) of the knee at the 5th and 10th day, and the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee-rating Score (HSS) at 1-month and 3-month follow-up were recorded. The data were compared between the two groups with paired t test. Results: All the patients were followed-up for more than 3 months. The mean VAS in CPM group and NEO-GAIT group on the 5th day was 2.4±1.1, 2.8±1.3, respectively; and it was 2.1±1.1, 2.5±1.2 respectively on the 10th day after the operation (t=-1.618, -1.505, both P>0.05). There was no significant difference in ROM on the 5th day after operation between the 2 groups (84°±12° vs 85°±12°, t=-0.377, P>0.05); however, it was remarkably higher in the NEO-GAIT group (95°±11°) than that in CPM group (88°±8°) on the 10th day after the operation (t=-3.002, P<0.05). The HSS score at 1-month follow-up in CPM group was 72±9, and it was 84±10 in NEO-GAIT group (t=-5.358, P<0.05); but it was comparative between the two groups at the 3-month follow-up (87±5 vs 89±5, t=-1.575, P>0.05). Conclusion: NEO-GAIT plays a more active and effective role in promoting postoperative rehabilitation after TKA than CPM.目的： 对比分析全膝关节置换术(TKA)后连续被动运动(CPM)与康复锻炼仪(NEO－GAIT)促进膝关节康复的疗效。 方法： 选取2017年1至7月在河北医科大学第三医院行TKA的患者，应用随机数字表法将患者分为2组，分别使用CPM及NEO－GAIT进行术后康复锻炼。其中CPM组30例，男8例，女22例；NEO－GAIT组30例，男6例，女24例。纪录比较两组术后第5、10天的疼痛视觉模拟评分(VAS)评分、膝关节活动度(ROM)和术后1个月、3个月时的纽约特种外科医院膝关节评分(HSS评分)。组间数据比较采用配对t检验。 结果： 60例患者均获得随访。CPM组、NEO－GAIT组患者术后第5天的VAS分别为(2.4±1.1)、(2.8±1.3)分，差异无统计学意义(t＝－1.618，P>0.05)；术后第10天分别为(2.1±1.1)、(2.5±1.2)分，差异亦无统计学意义(t＝－1.505，P>0.05)。术后第5天，CPM组、NEO－GAIT组膝关节ROM分别为(84±12)°、(85±12)°，差异无统计学意义(t＝－0.377，P>0.05)；术后第10天，2组患者的ROM分别为(88±8)°、(95±11)°，差异有统计学意义(t＝－3.002，P<0.05)。CPM组、NEO－GAIT组患者术后1个月的HSS评分差异有统计学意义[(72±9)比(84±10)分，t＝－5.358，P<0.05]，术后3个月的HSS评分差异无统计学意义[(87±5)比(89±5)分，t＝－1.575，P>0.05]。 结论： 与CPM比较，NEO－GAIT促进TKA术后患者康复具有更积极有效的作用。.

AB  - The results of ultrasound study of upper extremity tissues were comparatively analyzed in 74 patients with varying degrees of thermal burns. All the victims had thermal burns of the shoulder, forearm, and hand of one or both arms; the injured and contralateral normal areas were comparatively analyzed. The analysis of the findings has revealed that thermal burns of the upper extremities show certain ultrasound symptoms of soft tissue injuries that are indicative of the specific features of changes in the postburn period in relation to the degree of the injury - the duration of detection of edemas and fluid along the muscle bundles and tendon sheaths, their immobility during active and passive movements, the signs of extravasal compression, the determination of vascular wall complications, the signs of cartilaginous tissue damage, and articular complications.

AB  - The clinical effectiveness of an anti-arthrotic drug was investigated in a comparative trial. 106 patients suffering from moderate arthrosis of the knee were placed into two groups in accordance with a random table and treated by intramuscular injection of Arteparon forte or an analogous control product. The criteria of assessment were pain on movement, pain at rest, limitation of active and of passive movement. The number of patients who at the end of treatment and at the time of follow up, three months later, had no or insignificant residual symptoms and signs, were greater in the Arteparon forte group than in the control group. This difference was statistically significant two months after the beginning of treatment for the criterion pain at rest, and five months after beginning of treatment for all criteria. A global assessment of the results was carried out according to the number of pronouncedly improved criteria in the individual patients. According to this assessment, the results of treatment at the termination of treatment amounted to 73.6% in the Arteparon forte group and 56.6% in the control group. At the time of follow up the corresponding value of the Arteparon forte group was 68.4%, thus significantly greater than that of the control group (29.4%).

TI  - [Comparison of analgesic activity of intraarticular lornoxicam, bupivacaine and saline after knee arthroscopy].
PY  - 2008
AB  - Postoperative pain is an important parameter in discharge and rehabilitation in daycase arthroscopic knee surgery. This study compared the efficacy of intraarticular application of lornoxicam, bupivacaine and placebo on postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery. With the approval of the local ethics committee and informed consent of the patients, 90 patients (ASA score I-II), aged between 18-65 years undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy were included in this randomized, blinded, prospective study and were divided into three groups (30 patients each): 8 mg lornoxicam was applied to Group L (GL), 50 mg bupivacaine to Group B (GB) and normal saline to Group S (GS) in 20 mL volume intraarticularly. Postoperative analgesia was maintained by intravenous tramadol-HCl 50 mg/h at the first 4 h and then paracetamol 500 mg plus codeine 7.5 mg preparation as needed. The numeric rating scale (NRS) values were evaluated at rest and at active-passive motion at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h, total analgesic consumption were recorded. There were statistically significant differences between GS and GL and GS and GB in term of tramadol consumption (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05). The analgesiconsumption of GL patients at the end of 48 h were lower than GB and GS (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). The NRS values of GL were always lower than the other groups with statistical significance at certain times. We concluded that intraarticular lornoxicam provided better pain control than bupivacaine and saline in arthroscopic knee surgery.

TI  - [Comparison of therapeutic effects of three repair methods for rotator cuff tears under arthroscopy].
PY  - 2017
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively study curative effects of three repair methods for rotator cuff tears under arthroscopy, and to explore relationships between different repair methods and cuff lesions.METHODS: From January 2009 to Jaunary 2014, a total of 353 patients with rotator cuff tears treated with surgical repair under arthroscopy were included in this study. All the patients were divided into three groups according to time of visitiny hospital and it was divided into three periods. The patients on the first period were treated with single row rivet fixation(115 cases), including 51 males and 64 females, with an average age of (57.46±9.08) years old. The patients on the second period were treated with double row rivet fixation(163 cases), including 76 males and 87 females, with an average age of (56.93±9.92) years old. The patients in the third period were treated with suture bridge fixation(75 cases), including 32 males and 43 females, with an average age of (55.90±9.15) years old. There were 29 patients with huge rotator cuff injuries, who were treated with single-row suture. The shoulders were protected by a brace for 6 weeks after operations were permit ted to perform passive movement within 6 weeks, and then perform active shoulder exercise 6 to 10 weeks after operation. Constant-Murley score, UCLA score and VAS score were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively.RESULTS: All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 62 months, with a mean of 30 months. There was no infection or nerve injury. UCLA score was improved from preoperative 10.71±2.45 to postoperative 32.07±3.16; Constant-Murley score was improved from preoperative 43.33±11.55 to postoperative 78.15±12.64; VAS score was improved from preoperative 5.81±1.27 to postoperative 0.52±0.71. There were no statistical differences among three groups in UCLA score, Constant-Murley score and VAS score. Total 337 cases were satisfied with treatment results and 16 cases were not satisfied with the results. Among the 16 cases, 3 cases had huge rotator cuff surgery, and 13 cases had no joint stiffness before operation. The main complaints that resulted in dissatisfaction were weakness of the postoperative muscles and failure to restore the labour capacity(11 cases).CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff repair under arthroscopy has a reliable clinical effect for the patients with rotator cuff tears. Stable and reliable clinical results can be obtained regardless different repair methods or different rotator cuff tears. The following factors such as no stiffness before operation, too early active exercise and preoperative rotator cuff atrophy may be the risk factors for postoperative dissatisfaction of patients.

TI  - [Control of gaze and locomotion by spatial orientation].
PY  - 1991
AB  - We reported a new theory for daily vestibular functions which advocates top-down regulation of posture and gaze by supposing the coordinates in the brain. The hypothesis consists of three principles; first, the vestibular system is primarily a sensory system to detect spatial orientation; second, multisensory integrations reconstruct three-dimensional coordinates in the brain, which ascertain spatial orientation; third, daily behaviours like gazing or walking are controlled in a feed-forward manner by programming on the coordinates in the brain. The hypothesis was useful to understand strategic differences between active and passive movements, to distinct gaze control from ocular reflexes, to apply the rules of gaze control to posture control, and to clarify the mechanism to produce motion sickness.

PY  - 1987
AB  - 71 patients with variously located osteoarthrosis or primary fibromyalgic syndrome were treated with oral diacereine (DAR). The case series was accumulated in successive periods and may be divided into three groups. An "open" test on DAR (100 mg/die for 4 weeks) was conducted on the first group of 31 arthrosis patients. On the second group of 20 other arthrosis patients a "double-blind, cross-over" test was carried out using DAR (100 mg/die) and naproxene (500 mg/die) both for 2 weeks. The third group of 20 patients with fibromyalgia was treated with DAR alone: 100 mg/die 5 days a week for 12 weeks. The efficacy of the treatment was judged on the basis of the following parameters: rest pain, pressure pain, pain on active and passive movement, and functional limitation. In the first group a positive therapeutic effect was noted in 20 cases (68.9%). There were side effects (moderate diarrhea) in 3 patients 2 of whom suspended treatment. In the second group, DAR and naproxene had an almost identical effect. However 7 patients (36.8%) expressed a preference for DAR, 9 (47.4%) expressed no preference and only 3 (15.8%) preferred naproxene. Side effects were encountered in 3 patients treated with naproxene (2 cases of epigastralgia and pyrosis and 1 case of dyspnea so marked as to require suspension of treatment) and in 3 treated with DAR (modest diarrhea). In the third group, a positive therapeutic effect was noted in 68.4% of the patients with fibromyalgia with a 15% incidence of side effects consisting of slight abdominal pain (diarrhea caused suspension of treatment in 1 case only). Blood chemical parameters were studied in all three groups and no alterations attributable to the treatment were found. The obtained result suggests that the new drug is effective and well tolerated in the envisaged indications.

TI  - [Diagnosis and classification of temporomandibular dysfunction by the general dental practitioner].
PY  - 1996
AB  - Because of other diseases mimicking the symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance. Diagnostic subgroups of TMD (osteoarthrosis, anterior disc displacement with/without reduction, TMD-myo) can be distinguished by a combination of active movements, passive opening and palpation. Active movement appeared to be the most powerful test for distinguishing the subgroups of TMD, e.g. myogenous, arthrogenous, myogenous and arthrogenous. It is advised to have an open mind in the clinical examination and to be aware of the many mimicking disorders before reaching a diagnosis. An anamnestic questionnaire addressing the pain history, signs and symptoms of TMD, functional impairments, correlates of TMD, psychosocial evaluation and general health status is mandatory. Headache and neck pain often accompany TMD. In appropriate situations it is advised to refer to the proper specialist, before starting treatment for TMD. Orthopedic tests of the cervical spine are of minor importance in discriminating between patients with TMD and patients with cervical spine disorders (CSD). It is therefore advised to evaluate the function of the stomatognathic system in patients with neck complaints to rule out a possible involvement of this system.

TI  - [Diagnostic tests in carpal tunnel syndrome]
PY  - 1991
AB  - In a first series 100 patients underwent surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after being tested by provocative tests for sensory disturbances preoperatively. In addition to the well-established tests like passive wrist flexion (Phalen's test) or wrist extension, active movement tests of the patient against resistance were investigated. Tests of active movement were introduced because of the high values of intraoperatively measured pressure at the median nerve, similar to those recorded with passive movements. All investigated provocative tests for sensory disturbances related to CTS, investigated by active and passive movements, were positive in 72% to 84% of patients. Average delay times for reaction of these provocative tests ranged between 15.7 and 19.5 s. Furthermore Tinel's sign showed a sensitivity of 64% and the flick sign one of 69%. The specificity of tests and signs for the CTS was assessed on a group of 50 surgically treated patients with cervical nerve root entrapment at the C5-C8 level. In this group and a second CTS group the most sensitive of each test in the first series (active and passive provocational movement), Tinel's sign and flick sign were investigated. By forming subgroups in both diseases we showed that the results of the total groups were not influenced by a possible double crush. We could demonstrate high sensitivities in cervical nerve root entrapment for Phalen's sign with 74% and for active thumb abduction with 68% and a medium sensitivity for Tinel's sign with 40%--thus implying low specificity for CTS. Only the flick sign turned out to be relatively specific for CTS--its sensitivity in cervical nerve root entrapment was around 26%--indicating its potential to function as a valid criterion for the differential diagnosis of CTS and cervical nerve root entrapment syndrome.

TI  - [Disconnections in the breathing system].
PY  - 1993
AB  - Modern anaesthesia is considered as relatively safe. Nevertheless, incidents happen which result in harm for the patient. Incidents which cause hypoxia are especially grave. One of the most frequent incidents in anaesthesia and intensive care is of this nature: disconnection in the ventilatory apparatus. DEFINITION. Unintentional separation--partial or complete--of two manually connected components in a ventilatory apparatus. INCIDENCE. About 5% of incidents during narcosis are likely to be caused by disconnections in the ventilatory apparatus. CAUSES. Axially directed force of as little as 15 N may cause disconnection. It may result from active or passive movements of the patient, high pressure in the apparatus or unintentional traction on the breathing hoses. Conically moulded couplings are mostly used for connections. The stability of these so-called taper fit connections is decisively determined by the effort and technique of the user when coupling the two components. On the other hand the use of unsuitable materials may lead to an inadequate connection. Another possibility is damage by mechanical, chemical or thermal influences. Additionally, differences from the standard specifications of the components may occur. MOST COMMON SITES. Disconnections are found predominantly (in around 70% of cases) at the connection between the tube connector and the adapter or Y-piece. This joint represents a weak point, especially during surgical treatment in the head and neck region, when it cannot be controlled and in most cases is not accessible by hand because it is covered. CONSEQUENCES. The consequences of disconnection depend on different factors: relaxation of the patient, depth of narcosis, duration and localization of the disconnection, constitution and current oxygenation of the patient. An undetected disconnection may lead to hypoxia within a few minutes and then to irreversible brain damage and finally death. Serious incidents have been decreased in number in recent years by the application of improved monitoring procedures. DETECTION. Measurements of airway pressure, minute volume and expiratory CO2 by capnography ensure rapid detection of disconnections using appropriate adjustments of alarm limits. A disconnection may not be detected by pulse oximetry before a latent period, i.e. after a significant decrease of the oxygenation saturation of the patient. PREVENTION. Standardized specifications exist for technical dimensions of connectors, but "reliability" of connectors has not yet been defined in terms of technical requirements. Disconnection is currently prevented by application of various mechanical methods and devices, not all of which fulfil the conditions required of an ideal system: (1) Simple and fast connection ("single-handed operation"); (2) connection independent of the torsional angle between the two parts; (3)safe connection which cannot be detached unintentionally; (4) 360 degrees torsion possible after connection; (5) tight connection; (6) fast and easy deliberate disconnection; (7) intentional disconnection possible independent of the torsional angle between the two parts; (8) compatibility with conventional systems; (9) user's comfort and convenience (when ventilating with mask, etc.) as good as with conventional systems. DISCONNECTION OR EXTUBATION? There is a heated debate on the theme "disconnection". Some authors suspect that the development of reliable locking connections could lead to an increased frequency of unwanted extubations. To prevent unwanted extubations with consequent harm to patients, some developers propose a mechanical fuse, i.e. a defined site of fracture with an additional adequate monitoring device for reliable detection of disconnections. CONCLUSIONS. There are many approaches to the "disconnection" problem. In principle the problem requires a fundamental decision for each connection in the breathing system: safe prevention of disconnection (lock connection) or reliable mechanical f

TI  - [Does simple posterior dislocation of the elbow necessitate strict immobilization?].
PY  - 2000
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To research for the ideal treatment of isolated posterior dislocation with the elbow after reduction.METHODS: 36 patients of isolated posterior dislocation of the elbow after closed reduction (male 26, female 10; left 14, right 22; dominant extremity 21, undominant extremity 15; average age 22) were examined by varus and valgus stress test and push-draw test. Satisfactory stability from 30 degrees to 130 degrees flexion of the elbow was found in all patients. For the 30 patients below 35 years old, long-arm posterior splint was applied to immobilize the elbow joint at 90 degrees flexion and pronation for one week. For 6 patients over 35 years old, we only immobilized the elbow joint for 3 to 5 days with a neck-wrist sling. Prompt active motion begin after the swelling and pain reduced slightly, but the last 30 extension was not allowed for the first 1 to 2 weeks. Forceful passive motion and stretching of the elbow joint were avoided in all patients.RESULTS: The average follow-up time was 9 months (3 - 15 months). Range of motion and muscle power were regained within 3 - 4 months. 32 patients rehabilitated completely and 4 of the 6 patients decreased extension for 5 degrees - 10 degrees. No unstable symptoms and signs or recurrent dislocation were found. No ectopic calcification or post-traumatic arthritic changes were found on X-ray follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The ulna-humeral joint is one of the most highly constrained joints in the body with intrinsic stability. Bony structure is stable enough to allow for capsular and ligamental structure healing, even during active motion. For isolated posterior dislocation of the elbow joint, short-term immobilization and early functional exercise are desirable. Elbow instability and recurrent dislocation are rare and do not necessitate long-term strict immobilization.

TI  - [Double-center randomized controlled trial on post-stroke shoulder pain treated by electroacupuncture combined with Tuina].
PY  - 2012
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical therapeutic effect of post-stroke shoulder pain treated by acupuncture combined with Tuina.METHODS: Three hundred cases of post-stroke shoulder pain were randomly divided into an acupuncture and Tuina group and a rehabilitation group by double-center randomized controlled clinical trial method. In acupuncture and Tuina group, normalized electroacupuncture and Tuina therapy were applied, that was electroacupuncture at main points, such as Chize (LU 5), Quze (PC 3), Shaohai (HT 3), Jianyu (LI 15), Jianliao (TE 14) and Jianjing (GB 21),etc., combined with traditional Tuina manipulations; in rehabilitation group, the rehabilitation methods such as the electrostimulation through nervus cutaneus and the squeezing and stabilizing manipulations of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF), etc. were applied. The treatment courses of both groups were 6 weeks. The main therapeutic effect indices were the Assessment Face Scale (AFS) for pain when shoulder was in passive motion and the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment for upper limbs active function; the secondary indices were the moditied Rankin Scale (mRS) and the clinical incidences of shoulder-hand syndrome of hemiplegia and shoulder joint subluxation of hemiplegia.RESULTS: After 6 weeks treatment and 12 weeks follow-up, AFS score, Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of upper limbs active function and mRS evaluation in acupuncture and Tuina group were more obviously improved than those in rehabilitation group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Although the clinical incidences of shoulder-hand syndrome of hemiplegia and shoulder joint subluxation of hemiplegia in acupuncture and Tuina group was equal to those in rehabilitation group [3.55% (5/141) vs 8.45% (12/142), 1.42% (2/141) vs 5.63% (8/142), both P > 0.05], the data indicated that there was a superiority tendency in acupuncture and Tuina group.CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of electroacupuncture and Tuina is a normative manipulation, and the therapeutic effect is satisfying for post-stroke shoulder pain, superior to that of comprehensive rehabilitation treatment.

TI  - [EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF OLD EXTENSOR TENDON INJURY IN ZONE II].
PY  - 2015
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effectiveness of operative treatments for different kinds of old injury of extensor tendon in zone II so as to choose the best surgical approach based on the classification of injury.METHODS: Between May 2006 and May 2014, 68 cases of old injury of extensor tendon in zone II were treated. Among them, there were 50 males and 18 females with an average age of 36 years (range, 18-52 years). The causes included contusion injury in 50 cases, avulsion injury in 11 cases, and burn injury in 7 cases. The left side was involved in 21 cases and the right side in 47 cases. The injured finger involved the index finger in 18 cases, the middle finger in 21 cases, the ring finger in 24 cases, and the little finger in 5 cases. The disease duration was 1.5 months to 1 year (mean, 6.75 months). The central slip of extensor was repaired directly in 32 patients who had normal passive motion. Side cross stitch (8 cases) or Littler-Eaton (10 cases) method was used in 18 patients who can not extend actively and passively. Tendon graft was performed in 11 patients with tendon defect. Joint release was given in 7 patients with contracture after burn injury.RESULTS: Primary healing of incision was obtained in all cases. Sixty-eight cases were followed up 3-12 months (mean, 6.9 months). Three cases had tendon adhesion in varying degrees and suffered from pain, which was treated conservatively by functional exercise. Recurrence was observed in 2 cases, and extensor tendon was repaired again. According to total active motion (TAM) function assessment, the results were excellent in 52 cases, good in 11 cases, fair in 3 cases, and poor in 2 cases with an excellent and good rate of 92.6%.CONCLUSION: Adaptive operation method for old injury of extensor tendon in zone II should be selected based on the type of injury. The results will be satisfactory if correct method is chosen.

TI  - [Early clinical outcome of total knee arthroplasty for flexion-contracture deformity knees of different degrees].
PY  - 2006
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make a retrospective analysis on an early clinical outcome of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the knees with different degrees of flexion-contracture deformities.METHODS: Ninety-seven knees of 65 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with the Scorpion posterior-stabilized knee prosthesis from January 2000 to December 2003 were reviewed, including 51 osteoarthritis patients (74 knees) and 14 rheumatoid arthritis patients (23 knees). Thirty-three patients underwent unilateral TKA, and 32 patients underwent bilateral TKA. The average range of motion (ROM) before operation was 82.8 degrees (range, 5-140 degrees). According to the preoperative flexion-contracture degrees of the knees, these patients were divided into 2 groups, group A and group B. Group A consisted of the patients with flexion-contracture less than 20 degrees (range, 0-15 degrees), and group B consisted of the patients with flexion-contracture not less than 20 degrees (range, 20-60 degrees). In group A, the average flexion-contracture degree, ROM, KSS (knee society score), and function score were 10.7 +/- 8.0 degrees, 104.6 +/- 20.0 degrees, 29.1 +/- 18.0, and 32.6 +/- 20.7, respectively. But the corresponding data were much worse in group B than in group A, which were 28.2 +/- 7.8 degrees, 60.8 +/- 26.6 degrees, 12.1 +/- 13.2, and 26.8 +/- 18.1. All the operations were primary total knee arthroplasty, and they were performed by the same group of surgeons. The time for the prosthesis installed lasted for 25.6 minutes, and the average tourniquet time was 34.7 minutes. Three or four days after operation, the patients began the continuous passive motion (CPM) and active functional exercise of the knee.RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 2 years and 7 months(range, 8 mon-3.5 yr). During the follow-up period, the average flexion-contracture degree, ROM, KSS, and function score in group A were 0.4 +/- 2.1 degrees, 108.6 +/- 19.0 degrees, 82.1 +/- 13.8, and 72.3 +/- 29.1, respectively; and the corresponding data in group B were 1.3 +/- 3.2 degrees, 98.6 +/- 16.40, 75.9 +/- 8.2, and 81.4 +/- 26.9, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups. No revision or deep infection was found.CONCLUSION: The curative effect is mainly determined by the surgeon's good operational skills, rich clinical experience, and familiarity with the prosthesis, and it is not influenced by severity of the knee flexion-contracture deformity. The knee ROM after TKA, which has a "toward middle ROM" phenomenon, is influenced by many clinical factors. It is very important for the patient to perform a functional exercise of the knee as early as possible after operation.

TI  - [Effect of continuous femoral nerve block combined with periarticular local infiltration analgesia on early operative functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized double-blind controlled study].
PY  - 2017
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of early rehabilitation training after total knee arthroplasty surgery by continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with or without periarticular local infiltration analgesia (PLIA).METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study, 100 patients under-going primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty in patients with knee osteoarthritis were enrolled. All the patients received CFNB for postoperative analgesia before combined spinal epidural anesthesia. They were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=50 each): CFNB group, CFNB combined with PLIA group (PLIA group). Group PLIA received periarticular local infiltration analgesia with 20 mL ropivacaine (5 g/L), while the equal volume of normal saline was used instead of ropivacaine in group CFNB. Postoperative pain during rest and passive exercises including front and rear portions of knees, the time of ability to perform an active straight leg raise, the time of ability to reach 90° knee flexion, and preoperative and postoperative hospital for special surgery knee score (HSS) were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with group CFNB, the visual analogue scores (VAS) of front of knees at rest time in group PLIA had no significant difference (P>0.05); there were significant differences at 4, 8, 12, 24 h postoperation in portions of knees at rest time (P<0.05); the VAS had significant differences at 24 h in passive exercises of knees (P<0.05); the VAS had significant differences at 12, 24 h in portions of knees at passive exercises of the knees (P<0.05); the time of ability to perform an active straight leg raise had significant differences in the two groups (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Compared with CFNB postoperative analgesia alone, CFNB with PLIA could relieve rest pain and pain during passive movement after total knee arthroplasty. CFNB with PLIA could shorten the time to perform an active straight leg raise and the time of ability to reach 90° knee flexion. And so some patients could improve postoperative rehabilitation training.

TI  - [Effect of nerve growth factor on synaptic processes in the sympathetic ganglion].
PY  - 1988
AB  - The nerves growth factor (7S NGF) from salivary glands of male mice activated the interneuronal relations in the inferior mesenteric plexus of 6-14-day old guinea-pigs. Superfusion of the ganglia with 7S NGF diluted to 1 X 10(-8) M (135 ng/ml) inhibited suppression of the acetylcholine release with hemicholinum or modified solutions. Atropine (1 X 10(-6) M) did not alter, and benzohexonium (1 X 10(-6) M) eliminated the excitatory effect of the 7S NGF Under d-tubocurarine (1 X 10(-6) M) blockade of H-cholinoreceptors, the 7S NGF decreased the MP and increased the duration blockade of synaptic transmission. Reduction of the tested protein effects in presence of potassium (K+ - 0.24 mM) and ouabain (1 X 10(-7) M) suggested the effect of the 7S NGF on processes of active and passive movements of electrogenic cations.

TI  - [Effective encoding for the recognition of spatial configuration and color].
PY  - 2016
AB  - Three experiments examined the types of encoding that were effective for the recognition of spatial and color information. In Experiments 1 and 2, four experimental groups (each asked to form a different type of mental image of stimuli) and one control group (not asked to form an image) were presented spatial configuration patterns with different numbers of black dots. In both experiments, for the group that formed motor images with actual movement, the average score was higher for stimuli with a larger number of dots than for stimuli with fewer dots. Two groups, which formed dynamic visual images and motor images with no actual movement, respectively, showed similar limited effects. In Experiment 3, the five groups were presented two types of chromatic stimuli (colored panels and colored dots). Static visual images were effective for encoding the colored panels; however, static visual images and motor images with actual movement were effective for encoding the colored dots. These results suggest that motor and dynamic encodings facilitate memory for objects where spatial configuration is important for identification, while static visual images of the whole picture facilitate memory for objects where multiple colors are significant.

TI  - [Effectiveness of continuous passive motion after total knee replacement].
PY  - 2011
AB  - Continuous passive motion (CPM) is frequently used method in the early post-operative rehabilitation in patients after knee surgery. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CPM after primary total knee arthroplasty. Efficacy was assesed in terms of clinical score and functional recovery. 93 patients (101 knee joints) undergoing total knee replacement were assigned into two groups. The experimental group received continuous passive motion and active exercises. A control group received conventional physical therapy only. CPM was initiated in the first day after surgery, for 120 minutes, starting with 0-40 degrees range of motion, increased as tolerated (mean 10 degrees per day) and maintained during the hospital stay. Outcome measures were those included in Knee Society Score (KSS). Functional recovery was evaluated using WOMAC. All subjects were evaluated once before the surgery and on 10th day postoperatively. Mean clinical score (KSS) at the day 10 was 70 +/- 15 points in the experimental group and 74 +/- 12 in a control group. There were no statistical difference between the two groups for any outcome measures. CPM group mean range of motion was 83 degrees +/- 14 degrees and a group without CPM 77 degrees +/- 21 degrees. KSS functional score was 66 +/- 9 points in the experimental group compared to 62 +/- 7 points in a control group. Subjective estimation of pain level, joint stiffness and function showed no statistical difference between the two groups regarding total and subscale scores. Mean total score was 24 +/- 19 points in the CPM group and 22 +/- 17 in a group without CPM. These findings show that CPM had no significant advantage in terms of improving clinical measurements. However, there was beneficial effect on subjective assessment of pain level, joint stiffness and functional ability.

PY  - 1989
AB  - The efficacy and safety of the new non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug flunoxaprofen were compared with those of naproxen in a cross over clinical study in patients with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty female out-patients in the active phase of the disease were randomly assigned to one of the two groups studied; one group (A: 10 patients, mean age 51 years) received flunoxaprofen 400 mg/day p.o. for 30 days, followed by a 7-day wash-out period before starting the second treatment, with naproxen 500 mg/day p.o. for 30 days. Another group (B: 10 patients, mean age 58 years) received naproxen before flunoxaprofen and followed the same schedule of group A. The results showed that flunoxaprofen and naproxen have essentially equivalent therapeutical effects in controlling painful and functional symptoms of RA: both treatments resulted in a significant relief of spontaneous diurnal and nocturnal pain, pain on active and passive motion, morning stiffness, and in a significant improvement of grip strength and Richtie's index. None of the two drugs modified biochemical parameters of inflammation (ESR, CPR) or the laboratory variables measured to assess the tolerability of flunoxaprofen (hepatorenal function tests; haematological parameters). Flunoxaprofen was found to be very well tolerated: this feature together with the good therapeutic efficacy makes flunoxaprofen a very safe and useful tool in the management of severe chronic disease such as RA.

PY  - 1992
AB  - In this study the authors evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a foam of 15% ketoprofen lysine salt versus placebo in patients with articular traumas, pains and strains, distortions etc. All parameters considered were statistically significantly decreased after 7 days of active treatment as compared to placebo. Pain score decreased significantly at pressure (p < 0.001), pain on active movement (p < 0.005), pain on passive movement and pain at rest. Efficacy of the active foam was graded as satisfactory in 81.7% and its tolerability in 92.7% versus 44% and 29% with placebo respectively. Patients reported high acceptability (89%) of the new foam formulation. No systemic or local side effects were observed or reported. The 15% ketoprofen lysine salt foam for topical use can be considered an effective antiinflammatory and analgesic drug for the treatment of minor orthopedic and traumatic disorders, and was found to be perfectly tolerated.

TI  - [Evoked potentials].
PY  - 1994
AB  - Recent advances of evoked potentials, mainly pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials following CO2 laser stimulation (pain SEPs), were summarized. A small negative and a large positive potential, the N240-P340 and the N300-P400 following the hand and the foot stimulation, were identified in normal subjects. Conduction velocity of the A delta fibers and the spinothalamic tract was approximately 10 m/sec. Pain SEPs were significantly decreased in amplitude and the marked pain relief was induced by vibration applied to the area where laser stimulation was applied. This finding was compatible with the gate control theory. Active and passive movements of the limbs remote from and adjacent to the stimulated area significantly decreased pain SEPs in amplitude. This indicated the particular interactions between pain perception and movement-related cortical activities taken place in some areas of the brain. The theory, diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) proposed by Le Bars et al., was also confirmed by pain SEPs. Pain SEPs were useful in clinical testing. Pain SEP findings showed a significant correlation with the clinical impairment of pain sensation, and the subclinical lesions of the ascending pathways of the painful sensation were detected by pain SEPs.

TI  - [Exercise program for chronic low back pain based on common clinical characteristics of patients].
PY  - 2014
AB  - AIMS: 1. To determine which clinical characteristics are common in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and 2. To present an exercise program for CLBP composed on the basis of the common clinical characteristics of patients.THE EXAMINEES AND METHODS: In the prospective study, we have included 420 patients with nonspecific CLBP (group A), 420 patients with CLBP (with or without radicular pain) and degenerative changes of lumbosacral (LS) spine (group B) and 80 patients with CLBP after a lumbar disc herniation surgery (group C). The clinical characteristics of patients and especially the characteristics of the most important parameters for the selection of exercises have been evaluated by means of physiatric and manual functional examination.RESULTS: The vast majority of patients had these common clinical characteristics: 1. hypertonic/shortened lumbar extensors (A: 89,5%, B: 92%, C: 92,5%), 2. hypertonic/shortened psoas muscles (A: 83%, B: 90,5%, C: 92,5%), 3. restricted active (A: 71,4%, B: 89%, C: 94%) and passive (segmental) mobility (A: 86,4%, B: 92%, C: 95%) of LS spine, 4. painful active movements of LS spine (A: 44%, B: 88,6%, C: 95%), 5. scoliotic posture (more rarely scoliosis) usually in a combination with reduced/flattened lumbar lordosis (A: 87%, B: 89%, C: 90%), 6. hypotonic/ weak gluteal (A: 51,2%, B: 68%, C: 82,5%) and abdominal muscles (A: 33,8%, B: 56,5%, C: 60%) and 7. shortened hamstrings (A: 70,7%; hamstrings flexibility testing in patients from groups B and C is unreliable because of a frequently positive Lasegue's sign). In 6,7% of examinees from the group A, 4,8% examinees from the group B and 2,5% examinees from the group C, we have found LS spine hypermobility. Our exercise program for CLBP composed on the basis of the common clinical characteristics of the patients includes: 1. Stretching exercises for lumbar extensors, 2. Stretching exercises for psoas muscles, 3. Stretching exercises for hamstrings, 4. Strengthening exercises for abdominal muscles, 5. Strengthening exercises for gluteal muscles and 6. Flexion exercises for improvement of LS spine mobility.CONCLUSION: Our exercise program for CLBP comes unavoidably as a program of first choice in CLBP treatment. The main advantage of our program compared to standard programs is reflected in the targeted action on dysfunctional muscles and hypomobile facet joints. According to the results of our study, extension exercises for strengthening of lumbar extensors and hyperextension exercises for improvement of LS spine mobility are not appropriate for the majority of patients with CLBP.

TI  - [Glare adaptation for inhomogeneous glare distribution with respect to the dynamic components of the vision task].
PY  - 1995
AB  - Basic investigations in the field of adaptation luminance were carried out using Holladay's visual threshold criterion. The connection between adaptation luminance LA, illumination at the spot in the eye EB1 and the angle of glare theta is LA = 9.2 x EB1 x theta -2 LA in cd/m2, Eb1 in 1x, theta in degrees. In most cases the investigations of adaptation luminance were also carried out under conditions of fixed view and static visual tasks. It is however, important to take into account the dynamic visual task and the adaptation process by determining the adaptation luminance, but very few measurements have been carried out under these conditions. For the results represented here the visual threshold was replaced by the readaptation time necessary for perception of movement direction of a striped pattern (dynamic) and with the idea of also comparing the perception of the slot location in a ring in the Landolt rings (static). The method of investigations was as follows: The subject adapts to the inhomogeneous field of luminance for which the adaptation luminance must be determined. Then in a dark surrounding field for comparison, the visual task is offered, and the readaptation time necessary for the fulfillment of the visual task is measured. This procedure is repeated with a homogeneous field of luminance. The luminance of a homogeneous field is equal to the adaptation luminance. If the readaptation times are equal, the inhomogeneous distribution of luminance has the adaptation luminance LA. The important difference in comparison to previous investigations is the inclusion of dynamic components (readaptation time and dynamic visual task).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PY  - 1991
AB  - Humero-scapular periarthrosis (PH) is defined as an idiopathic painful condition in the shoulder with simultaneous limitation of active and passive movements in all directions. The condition is characterized by three phases: a painful period, a period dominated by stiffness and a period of recovery. PH is commonest between the ages of 40 and 60 years and the cumulated risk is estimated to be 2%. The incidence is higher in diabetics. The cause of PH is unknown and knowledge of the pathogenesis is very limited. Histological examination shows inflammation and fibrosis. Association with other pathological conditions of the upper limb or medical conditions, except diabetes mellitus, has not been documented with certainty. The average duration is 30 months but recovery without functional defects is common. Treatment is symptomatic and consists primarily of analgesics and rest during the painful phase. Local injections of steroids may be of effect. Exercises may be employed once the pain is under control and these have the object of improving mobility and increasing muscular strength.

The Humphrey kinetic perimetry comes close to Goldmann perimetry and the Octopus shows clear advantages, notably in terms of ergonomics and its more sophisticated software. The Goldmann requires a high level of skill; examination time with the Humphrey and the Octopus is at least double the time required by a skilled Goldmann operator. The examiner can to a certain degree be passive during the static visual field examination, but is entirely active during the kinematic visual field examination. Therefore, contrary to static perimetry, the examination can only be performed by a physician. The future of automated kinematic perimetry depends on simplification of the software.

TI  - [Improved structure identification with tissue Doppler echocardiography]. [German]
PY  - 1998
AB  - Tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) has been shown to be of particular value in patients with impaired myocardial function. Recently, the technique was successfully employed to localize the ventricular insertion of accessory atrioventricular pathways. The identification of abnormal cardiac structures is coming up now as a new field of clinical interest. The purpose of this study was to differentiate anomalous cardiac and aortic from native structures by physical properties of tissue motion using transesophageal TDE. Characteristic motion patterns of anomalous structures have not been described in detail and tissue Doppler findings have not been associated with clinical features up to now. Forty consecutive patients were included after anomalous cardiac or vascular structures had been detected by conventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A control group consisted of 20 subjects. Rapidity of diagnosis in anomalous structures was divided into 3 categories, and TDE signals were related to particular pathology by a blinded, 2nd observer. Three different motion patterns could be defined: incoherent motion due to free oscillation of an anomalous structure which is independent of the surrounding tissue (Figure 1b); coherent motion with a phase difference meaning that motion depends on the motion of the surrounding tissue but is out of phase (Figure 2); concordant motion showing no difference in direction, velocity, or phase of motion compared with the surrounding tissue. Incoherent motion was present in endocarditic vegetations, 4th degree aortic plaques, Chiari network, valvular prolapse, intracavitary tumors, and freely oscillating thrombi as well as in normal valve leaflets and papillary muscles. Especially if endocarditic vegetations are present its incoherent motion facilitates to recognize these small structures. The colorcode of this motion pattern demarcates the vegetation reliably from the surrounding tissue (Figure 1b). Within 15 seconds vegetations could be detected in 9 (82%) vs 2 (18%) patients employing only conventional imaging. Using conventional echocardiographic approaches detection of vegetations is frequently hindered by their small size and minor echo intensity (Figure 1a). In contrast, size and echo intensity do not affect the tissue Doppler signal. Normal papillary muscles and distal portions of the mitral and tricuspid valves were demonstrated to regularly meet the criterion of incoherent tissue motion in the control group. In part, this was also observed with respect to the aortic and pulmonary valves. In valvular tissue incoherent motion was caused by passive floating, whereas papillary muscles show an active inverse motion for short time intervals. Nevertheless, physiologic incoherent motion did not lead to any false differential diagnosis. The phase difference of coherent motion results from damped oscillation. This phenomenon was visualized by tissue Doppler M-mode in 5 thrombi of the left atrial appendage (LAA) (100%) and in 1 ventricular thrombus (50% of all clots). Concordant motion was shown in 3rd degree aortic plaques and postrheumatic and calcified vegetations. These structures were found to be completely embedded or closely attached, so that their passive motion corresponded to the motion of the surrounding regular tissue. Detection and assessment of anomalous structures are based on their motion patterns which can be synchronous or asynchronous in comparison with the surrounding tissue. Another goal of this investigation was to test if the sensitivity of TEE to spontaneous echo contrast can be improved using TDE. In 21 patients presenting with left atrial dilation (left atrial diameter > 44 mm) due to mitral stenosis (n = 8), mitral regurge (n = 5), arterial hypertension (n = 5) and multiple valvular disease (n = 3) fundamental multiplane TEE and transesophageal TDE were performed with standardized gain setting. The control group consisted of 20 randomized individuals with normal left

PY  - 2006
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the influence of preoperative range of motion (ROM) and maximal flexion degree on the early clinical outcome of total knee arthroplasty (TKA).METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2003, 97 knees of 65 patients that were underwent total knee arthroplasty with Scorpio posterior-stabilized knee prosthesis were reviewed. There were 55 osteoarthritis patients (81 knees), and 10 rheumatoid arthritis (16 knees). Thirty-three patients were underwent unilateral TKA, 32 patients were underwent bilateral TKA. According to the preoperative ROM of knee, these patients were divided into two groups, one <or= 90 degrees (range, 5 degrees - 90 degrees ) and the other > 90 degrees (range, 95 degrees - 140 degrees ). Finally the clinical outcomes of two groups (include ROM, maximal flexion degree, KSS score and function score) were evaluated. Three days later after operation, continuous passive motion (CPM) and active functional exercise of the knee were begun, and the wound healed well in all patients. All these operations were primary total knee arthroplasty.RESULTS: The patients were followed up for average 2 years 5 months (range, 10 months to 3 years 8 months). The average ROM of knee was improved to 101.6 degrees (range, 40 degrees - 140 degrees ) after operation from 84.2 degrees (range, 5 degrees - 140 degrees ) before operation (P = 0.000); the average maximal flexion degree was decreased from 103.5 degrees (range, 25 degrees - 140 degrees ) before operation to 101.6 degrees (range, 40 degrees - 140 degrees ) after operation (P = 0.439); KSS of knee joint was improved to 78.8 points after operation (range, 50 - 95 points) from 19.5 points (-24 - 62 points) before operation (P = 0.000). There was statistically difference between the clinical outcomes (ROM, maximal flexion degree, KSS score and function score) in the two groups before and after operation. Those knees with good preoperative ROM tend to lose flexion, while those with poor preoperative ROM gain flexion after TKA. No revision and deep infection happened.CONCLUSIONS: TKA is a complex operation, the clinical outcome of TKA is mainly determined by the good operation skill, abundant clinical experience and the familiarity with the prosthesis of the surgeon. At the same conditions such as same surgeon, same prosthesis and same physical therapy, preoperative range of motion of knee influence on the early clinical outcome of total knee arthroplasty, knees that have good preoperative ROM have better clinical outcomes postoperatively than those with poor preoperative ROM.

TI  - [Influences of different rehabilitative methods on function of hands and psychological anxiety of patients with deeply burned hands retaining denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin].
PY  - 2017
AB  - Objective: To investigate influences of different rehabilitative methods on function of hands and psychological anxiety of patients with deeply burned hands retaining denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin. Methods: Forty-four patients with deeply burned hands, conforming to the study criteria were admitted to Department of Burns and Reconstructive Surgery of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 2014 to June 2015. Patients were divided into propaganda education rehabilitation group (PER, n=23) and specially-assigned person rehabilitation group (SAPR, n=21) according to the random number table and patients' willingness. On post injury day 3 to 7, 36 burned hands in group PER and 33 burned hands in group SAPR underwent operation of retaining denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin. Patients in 2 groups received anti-scar treatment of hands with silicone gel from postoperative day 10. Besides, patients in group PER underwent active functional exercise under guidance of duty nurse and received psychological guidance from duty nurse with grade two psychological consultant certificate. Patients in group SAPR underwent active and passive functional exercise under guidance of rehabilitation therapist and received psychological guidance from psychotherapist with intermediate title. In postoperative month (POM) 1, 3 and 6, ranges of active motion of burned finger joints of patients in 2 groups were measured with joint goniometer to calculate excellent and good ratio of total active motion (TAM) range. Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients were measured with electronic hand dynamometer, and psychological anxiety was scored with Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Data were processed with chi-square test, independent sample t test, McNemar test, analysis of variance of repeated measurement, SNK test and Bonferroni correction. Results: (1) Ratio of excellent and good of TAM range of burned finger joints of patients in group SAPR in POM 6 was obviously higher than that in group PER (chi(2)=10.745, P<0.0167 ). Ratio of excellent and good of TAM range of burned finger joints of patients in 2 groups in POM 3 were obviously higher than that in POM 1 of the same group, respectively (with P values below 0.0167). (2) Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients in group SAPR in POM 1, 3, and 6 were respectively (8.2±2.6), (21.6±2.6) and (30.1±2.3) kg, obviously higher than those in group PER [ (5.3±1.3), (12.8±2.7), (20.0±1.8) kg, respectively, with t values from 5.934 to 20.403, P values below 0.01]. Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients in 2 groups in POM 3 and 6 were obviously higher than those at the previous time point of the same group (with P values below 0.05). (3) SAS scores of patients in group SAPR in POM 1, 3 and 6 were significantly lower than those in group PER (with t values from 2.944 to 4.758, P values below 0.01). SAS scores of patients in 2 groups in POM 3 and 6 were significantly lower than those at the previous time point of the same group (with P values below 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with rehabilitation of propaganda and education, rehabilitation under specially-assigned person can improve TAM range of burned finger joints, value of grip strength, and psychological anxiety of patients with deeply burned hands retaining the denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin.目的： 探讨不同康复方法对手部深度烧伤保留变性真皮＋大张自体皮移植术患者手功能和焦虑心理的影响。 方法： 选择中南大学湘雅医院烧伤重建外科2014年1月2015年6月收治的符合入选标准的手部深度患者44例，根据随机数字表法并结合患者意愿分为宣教康复组23例和专人康复组21例，2组分别有36、33只患手，均于伤后3～7 d行保留变性真皮＋大张自体皮移植术。2组患者均于术后10 d开始使用硅酮凝胶进行手部抗瘢痕治疗，此外，宣教康复组患者在责任护士的指导下进行主动功能锻炼，由持有二级心理咨询师证的责任护士进行心理指导；专人康复组患者在康复治疗师的指导下进行主动与被动相结合的功能锻炼，由中级心理治疗师进行心理指导。术后1、3、6个月，用关节角度尺测量2组患者患手各手指关节的主动活动度，计算其总主动活动度(TAM)优良率；用电子握力计测量患者患手握力值，并用焦虑自评量表(SAS)对患者焦虑心理进行评分。对数据行chi(2)检验、独立样本t检验、McNemar检验、重复测量方差分析、SNK检验及Bonferroni校正。 结果： (1)专人康复组患者仅术后6个月患手手指关节TAM优良率显著高于宣教康复组(chi(2)＝10.745，P<0.0167)。2组患者术后3个月患手手指关节TAM优良率均显著高于组内术后1个月(P值均小于0.0167)。(2)专人康复组患者术后1、3、6个月患手握力值分别为(8.2±2.6)、(21.6±2.6)、(30.1±2.3)kg，显著高于宣教康复组的(5.3±1.3)、(12.8±2.7)、(20.0±1.8)kg(t值为5.934～20.403，P值均小于0.01)。2组患者术后3、6个月患手握力值均明显高于组内前一时相点(P值均小于0.05)。(3)专人康复组患者术后1、3、6个月SAS评分明显低于宣教康复组(t值为2.944～4.758，P值均小于0.01)。2组患者术后3、6个月SAS评分均明显低于组内前一时相点(P值均小于0.05)。 结论： 与宣教康复相比，专人康复治疗可提高手部深度烧伤保留变性真皮并移植大张自体皮患者患手手指关节TAM、握力值，改善患者的焦虑心理。.

PY  - 2001
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary repair of flexor tendons in zone II of the hand and early post-operative rehabilitation is no longer challenged. However, early rehabilitation methods vary from one unit to another. Although currents techniques such as of Kleinert's and Duran's have brought considerable improvements in functional outcomes, they do not allow early active motion of repaired flexor tendons.METHODS: A promising method of active controlled mobilization has been proposed by the Bordeaux Hand Unit and adopted by our rehabilitation unity since 1995. The aims of this method are: to avoid of proprioceptive inhibition linked to passive methods and prevention of adhesions. This method has been assessed by a prospective study of 22 consecutive patients with average follow-up of 11.8 months.RESULTS: Our rating was based on the Strickland scoring technique. 81% of good and excellent results were observed. Our score rates confirm the results published by others authors who have applied the same active protocols. The results observed in our series tend to confirm the advantages of early controlled active mobilization techniques and lead us to pursue their application in the future.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Coordinated movements of arms and legs suppose the neural interaction between the generators of the rhythmics of the upper and lower extremities. In the lying position in 10 healthy subjects activity of the muscles of the upper and lower extremities was recorded when separate and joint cyclic movements of the arms and legs with different phase relationships between the movements of the limbs were performed, and under various conditions of the motor task. Antiphased active arm movements were characterized by increased muscle activity than during in-phase mode. The activity of the arm muscles under passive movements, imposed by experimenter, was significantly less than their activity when passive movements of the arms were imposed by the other arm. When loading one arm the muscle activity in the other passively moving arm increased independently from the synergy of arm movements. During motor tasks, implementing joint antiphased movements as the upper and lower extremities, compared to motor task, implementing their joint in-phase movements, there has been a significant increase in activity in the biceps brahii muscle, the tibialis anterior muscle and biceps femoris muscle. Loading of arms in these motor tasks has been accompanied by increased activity in some of the leg muscles. Increasing of frequency of rhythmic movements resulted in a significant growth of the muscle activity of the arms and legs with their cooperative movements with greater rate of rise of flexor muscles activity for arms and legs during joint antiphased movements. Thus, the spatial organization of movements and kind of afferent influences are significant factors of interlimb interaction, which, in turn, determine the type of neural interconnections that are involved in the regulation of movements.

PY  - 1998
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study has been carried out in order to assess the clinical and functional efficacy and tolerability of galactosa-minoglucuronoglycan sulphate (GGGS). The molecule has been intra-articularly administered in patients affected by moderate primary gonarthritis, according to clinical and functional parameters.METHODS: At the beginning and at the end of each period of treatment the following parameters have been evaluated: spontaneous pain, provoked pain, pain during active movement, pain during passive movement, pain at rising (7-8:00 a.m.) pain at bed time (10:00 p.m.), execution time (expressed in seconds) of up-down from a chair (five times), execution time (expressed in seconds) to walk 15 meters. Fifty patients affected by osteoarthritis of the knee were treated weekly, during one year, for two periods of six weeks each with a total amount of 12 injections.RESULTS: Treatment with Galactosaminglucuronoglycan sulphate (GGGS) seems to be effective in the therapy of osteoarthritis of the knee. The pain scores decreased and the functional levels significantly (p < 0.01) improved in a large proportion of patients and GGGS was very well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that intra-articular treatment is a substantially new way for GGGS administration in the therapy of osteoarthritis of the knee.

TI  - [Intraoperative pressure measurement at the median nerve in carpal tunnel syndrome and its surgical significance].
PY  - 1991
AB  - The authors measured the intraoperative pressures on the median nerve in local anesthesia in thirty patients. Pressures were recorded at the distal antebrachial fascia near the carpal tunnel, at the proximal and distal carpal tunnel and at the level of the palmar fascia distal to the carpal tunnel. The two passive and three active movements examined generally led to a pressure elevation. Passive movements had a greater effect on pressure at the proximal carpal tunnel. Active movements led to a high pressure level in the proximal and distal carpal tunnel higher than those observed during passive movements. Beneath the distal antebrachial fascia near the carpal tunnel, the pressure level was higher than beneath the antebrachial fascia at a greater distance from the carpal tunnel. Pressure levels beneath the distal antebrachial fascia correlated with the patient's age. Pressure values beneath the palmar fascia were low during passive and active movements. As a consequence, division of the flexor retinaculum and the distal antebrachial fascia up to 3 cm proximal of the carpal tunnel is necessary, whereas dissection of the palmar fascia distal to the carpal tunnel is not.

PY  - 1980
AB  - Two cases of intrathoracic dislocation of Kirschner's wire are reported. In one case the migration of the wire had been discovered 3 years after osteosynthesis of the acromioclavicular joint and incomplete removal of the metal. In another case a fragment of Kirschner's wire had to be removed by mediastinoscopy five months after fixation of the sternoclavicular joint. The application of wire in clavicular joint position - even in connection with cerclage - does not correspond with the conditions of osteosynthesis fit for active or passive movement. Ligament healing requires additional fixation, gymnastic mobilisation under control is necessary. The wires should be removed completely after 8-10 weeks, intrathoracic dislocation requires treatment by a surgeon with good experience in thoracic surgery.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Low back pain is one of the main problems of health care, and has many causes. To prevent low back pain daily activities are highly important--static work as well as dynamic movement--carried out in an ergonomic and economical way. Studies have shown that the compliance of patients with regard to exercise training and ergonomic recommendations is not very high. The main posture of Qi Gong training is similar to the recommended posture by low back schools. Qi gong exercises respect basic physiological and ergonomic principles of movement in every way. Qi Gong fulfils the most important criteria for the prevention and therapy of idiopathic low back pain. Qi Gong training requires no special equipment. It is simple and can be undertaken everywhere. A growing number of people have become interested in Qi Gong, and train regularly and effectively. Low back pain rarely occurs in such people, and therefore Qi Gong should be considered as one of the most effective means of prevention.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Pain in the shoulder should prompt a systematic clinical examination that adheres closely to the functional anatomy. The basic examination of the shoulder joint comprises active and passive movements and isometric resistance tests with the aid of which external and internal rotation and abduction/adduction can be investigated. The results of these tests provide the physician with a "pattern of findings" which unequivocally identifies the pain-triggering structure. Accordingly, shoulder pain can be classified into four categories as proposed by Cyriax. As treatment, intra-articular injections of corticoids or local anesthetics as determined by findings, where necessary supported by physiotherapeutic measures. Rupture of a tendon, in particular in the case of an active patient, is an indication for surgery.

PY  - 2012
AB  - In order to find the linear region of adjustment process about human body balance under the passive movement, and provide the basis for the unified evaluation criteria of passive balance test, an equipment was built with pulsed excitation source and wave detector of gravity's center. The pulsed excitation source was a multi-dimensional motion platform with high accuracy. The wave detector was a force platform. Human body and force platform were treated as a whole object, and the dynamic model of the object was built using the method of system identification. The balance ability was evaluated by setting time. In the pulse excitement range from 2mm to 20 mm with 2mm increments, balance ability of 5 students was evaluated and analyzed respectively. Results showed that response curve of human balance regulation was a typical second order linear system characteristic, and in a large enough linear region, the evaluating result had good consistency.

PY  - 1994
AB  - The use of mechanical ankle exercise devices with continuous passive motion (CPM) of the ankle joint can improve venous reflow in the lower limbs after operations. Duplex ultrasonography allows the observations of blood flow velocity and flow volume during continuous movement of the devices. We tested two different CPM devices for ankle movement in a preclinical study on 10 healthy, uninjured people and saw the following changes in the deep venous system in the common femoral vein: after 5 min of motion the velocity of the venous reflow was increased to 112.5% and the flow volume passing the femoral vein to 123% of the initial mean values. After 15 min of motion the devices led to an increase of the venous reflow velocity to 125% and of flow volume to 143% of the baseline values in the femoral vein. These positive effects were still evident even 15 min after the devices have been turned off.

PY  - 1987
AB  - The efficacy and the tolerability of the new non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent flunoxaprofen was assessed in the long-lasting management of pain and joint motility impairment of 28 patients suffering from radiologically proven osteoarthritis localized on the large joints (hip and knee). The patients were treated with flunoxaprofen 200-400 mg/day per os for 2 months (18 patients) or for 4 months (10 patients) and the following variables were assessed: spontaneous diurnal and nocturnal pain, pain on passive motion, pain on active motion with or without load, quality of sleep, joint motion range, intercondylar and intermalleolar straddles and gluteus-heel straddle; patients' and physician' evaluation of flunoxaprofen efficacy. Moreover a number of clinical and laboratory controls were carried out to study the tolerability of the drug (arterial blood pressure, heart rate, hepatic and renal function tests, haematological examination). The assessments were made before the starting of the treatment and at 15-day intervals thereafter. The results show that all variables for pain intensity greatly and progressively improved during flunoxaprofen treatment; the quality of sleep as well as the joint motion range improvement went along the progressive decrease in pain intensity. None of the clinical and laboratory parameters studied showed any modification during flunoxaprofen treatment. No side-effects were observed in any patients, either after 4 months treatment or using 400 mg/die. It is concluded that flunoxaprofen may be considered an effective and safe non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent in the long-lasting management of pain and joint motility impairment of osteoarthritic patients.

Defect was caused by crush injuries in 12 cases, by avulsion injury in 3 cases, by twist injury in 2 cases and by incised injury in 1 case. The time from injury to operation was 2-8 hours (mean 4 hours). The location were index fingers (3 fingers), middle fingers (4 fingers) and ring fingers (17 fingers). The defects of soft tissue were 1.9 cm x 1.7 cm to 2.4 cm x 1.9 cm in size, the reverse homodigital artery island flaps were from 2.0 cm x 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm x 2.0 cm in size. The donor site was repaired with dumped skin grafting (3 cases) and with skin grafting from medial area of planta pedis (15 cases).RESULTS: Skin flaps and skin grafting of all the 24 fingers survived after operation. All incisions and donor sites healed by first intention. Sixteen patients (22 fingers) were followed up for 1-5 years (mean 3.2 years).The appearance and function of the flaps were all satisfactory. Two-point discriminations of flaps ranged from 4.5 mm to 6.3 mm. According to the total active movement/total passive movement assessment criteria, the results were excellent in 20 fingers and good in 2 fingers; and the excellent and good rate was 100%. The circumference of donor site was 2.0-3.5 mm shorter than that of normal side. The two-point discriminations of donor site was 7.8-10.5 mm.CONCLUSION: Repairing defect of fingertip with modified reverse homodigital artery island flap can provide good texture and contour matching the recipient area, good function and little trauma at donor site.

TI  - [Motor learning of the post-stroke patients presenting with upper limb paresis on the mechanotherapeutic system].
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND: the relevance of this study arises from the high prevalence of upper limb motor impairment and pathological synergy in the post-stroke patients; these conditions are very difficult to correct with the use of the traditional rehabilitation methods. A promising but insufficiently studied approaches are the virtual reality (VR) technology as well as its combination with other techniques.AIM: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the training making use of the mechanotherapeutic system on the motor function of the paretic hand.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled in this study. The main group comprised 20 of them who completed the training course on the mechanotherapeutic system allowing for separate adjustment of weight support for the shoulder and the forearm, VR feedback with individual setting of the active working space, and augmented functional exercises. The control group consisted of the patients (n=10) who performed the task-oriented motor training course of an equal duration with arm weight support and visual feedback.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The assessment based on the Fugl-Meyer scale (FMA) showed the statistically significant changes in the passive motion range in the patients of both groups, but only those comprising the main group were found to experience the improvement of the major movements of the arm, wrist, and hand as well as movements outside synergy (p<0.005). Fine motor skills estimated from the results of the Action Research Arm test (ARAT) improved only in the main group due to the cylindrical and pinch grip (p<0.005). Also, only patients of the main group, improved daily living skills evaluated based on the Frenchay Arm test (FAT) (p<0.005).CONCLUSION: The results of the present study give evidence that the use of combined training with arm weight support and VR feedback contributes to a more complete recovery of motor and daily living skills in the upper limb of post-stroke patients, compared to the classical task-oriented training with visual feedback.Актуальность проблемы продиктована высокой распространенностью двигательных нарушений руки у пациентов, перенесших инсульт, и частотой развития патологических синергий в ней, препятствующих эффективному восстановлению ее функции с помощью традиционных методов реабилитации. Перспективным, но недостаточно изученным методом является технология виртуальной реальности, а также ее комбинация с другими методиками. Цель изучить влияние тренировок с помощью механотерапевтического комплекса на двигательную функцию паретичной руки. Материал и методы. В исследование были включены 30 пациентов: 18 мужчин и 12 женщин. Все больные были разделены на две группы: основную и контрольную. Пациенты основной группы (n=20) проходили тренировку на механотерапевтическом комплексе с раздельно настраиваемой для плеча и предплечья разгрузкой веса, виртуальной обратной связью с индивидуальным подбором площади активной рабочей зоны, а также с помощью функциональных упражнений с расширенной обратной связью. Пациенты контрольной группы (n=10) получали эквивалентный по продолжительности курс тренировок с применением методики целенаправленного двигательного обучения с разгрузкой веса руки и зрительной обратной связью. Результаты. По шкале ФуглМейера у пациентов обеих групп были отмечены статистически значимые изменения объема пассивных движений, однако только в основной группе были зафиксированы достоверные улучшения крупных движений руки, движений запястья и кисти, а также движений вне синергий (p<0,005). Навык мелкой моторики кисти по шкале оценки функции руки (Action Research Arm test) изменился только в основной группе за счет улучшения цилиндрического и щипкового захватов (p<0,005). Также только в основной группе достоверно улучшились навыки бытовой активности по тесту Френчай (p<0,005). Обсуждение. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют о значимом увеличении объема активных движений в основной группе, снижении двигательной компенсации со стороны крупных мышц плечевого пояса при выполнении движений (достижение объекта и его последующего захвата) паретичной рукой. Кроме того, проведение занятий с использованием разгрузки паретичной руки способствовало большей интенсивности тренировочного процесса (увеличению повторов упражнений) без чрезмерного утомления пациента, что, в свою очередь, давало возможность увеличивать продолжительность занятий. Заключение. Таким образом, применение комбинированной тренировки с разгрузкой веса руки и виртуальной обратной связью способствует более полному восстановлению двигательных и базовых бытовых навыков у пациентов, перенесших инсульт, в отличие от классической целенаправленной тренировки со зрительной обратной связью.

TI  - [Mutual influences of upper and lower extrimities during cyclic movements].
PY  - 2011
AB  - The possibility of muscle activation of passive arm during its cyclic movements, imposed by active movements of contralateral arm or by experimenter was studied, as well as the influence of lower extremities cyclic movements onto arm muscles activity. In addition to that the activity of legs muscles was estimated in dependence on motor task condition for arms. Ten healthy supine subjects carried out opposite movements of arms with and without stepping-like movements of both legs. The experiment included three conditions for arm movements: 1) the active movements of both arms; 2) the active movements of one arm, when other entirely passive arm participated in the movement by force; 3) passive arm movement caused by experimenter. In the condition 2) additional load on active arm was applied (30 N and 60 N). In all three conditions the experiment was carried out with arms movements only or together with legs movements. The capability of passive moving arm muscles activation depended on increasing afferent inflow from muscles of contralateral arm was demonstrated. Emerging electrical activity was modulated in the arms movements cycle and depended on the degree of active arm loading. During combined active movements of arms and legs the reduction of activity in the flexor muscles of shoulder and forearm was observed. Concomitant arms movements increased the magnitude ofelectromiographic bursts during passive stepping-like movements in the most of recorded muscles, and the same increasing was only observed in biceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscles during active legs movement. The increasing of loading of one arm caused essential augmentation of EMG-activity in the majority of recording legs muscles. The data obtained are the additional proof of existence of functionally significant neuronal interaction both between arms and between upper and lower extremities, which is evidently depend on the intraspinal neuronal connections.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Neural mechanisms of motor signal transmission in ventrooral (Voi) nucleus of motor thalamus during the realization-of voluntary and involuntary abnormal (dystonic) movements in patients with spasmodic torticollis were investigated by means of microelectrode technique. The high reactivity of the cellular Voi elements to various functional (mainly motor) tests was proved. Analysis of neuronal activity showed: (1) the difference of neural mechanisms of motor signal transmission in the realization of voluntary movement with and without the involvement of the pathological axial neck muscles, as well as passive and abnormal involuntary dystonic movements; (2) significance of sensory component in the mechanisms of sensorimotor interactions during realization of voluntary and involuntary dystonic head and neck movements, causing the activation of the axial neck muscles; (3) important role of the rhythmic and synchronized neuronal activity in motor signal transmission during the realization of active and passive movements. Participation of Voi nucleus in pathological mechanisms of spasmodic torticollis was shown. The data obtained can be used for identificatiori of Voi thalamic nucleus during stereotactic neurosurgical operations in patients with spasmodic torticollis for selection the optimum destruction (stimulation) target and reduction of postoperative effects.

PY  - 2002
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the moving patterns of Oncomelania snails, intermediate host of S. japonicum, in the water bodies.METHODS: Based on the biological features of the snails, methods and techniques in relation to hydraulics and silt engineering were adopted to investigate the active scrawl ability and passive movement of the snails.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The scrawl speed of the snails themselves was very low, 2.45 mm per minute only. The active movement in the water current was therefore almost negligible. The major moving patterns of the snails in rivers and canals were that: 1. Snails adsorbed on different kinds of carriers drifted on the water. 2. Snails suspended on the water and drifted with the current, these were the young snails under 7 weeks of age. Adult snail showed a strong ability of adhesion, 12 times higher than its body weight.

TI  - [Occupational neurotoxicology due to heavy metals-especially manganese poisoning].
PY  - 2007
AB  - The most hazardous manganese exposures occur in mining and smelting of ore. Recently, the poisoning has been frequently reported to be associated with welding. In occupational exposure, manganese is absorbed mainly by inhalation. Manganese preferentially accumulates in tissues rich in mitochondria. It also penetrates the blood brain barrior and accumulate in the basal ganglia, especially the globus pallidus, but also the striatum. Manganese poisoning is clinically characterized by the central nervous system involvement including psychiatric symptomes, extrapyramidal signs, and less frequently other neurological manifestations, Psychiatric symptomes are well described in the manganese miners and incrude sleep disturbance, disorientation, emotional lability, compulsive acts, hallucinations, illusions, and delusions. The main characteristic manifestations usually begin shortly after the appearance of these psychiatric symptomes. The latter neurological signs are progressive bradykinesia, dystonia, and disturbance of gait. Bradykinesia is one of the most important findings. There is a remarkable slowing of both active and passive movements of the extremities. Micrographia is frequently observed and a characteristic finding. The patients may show some symmetrical tremor, which usually not so marked. The dystonic posture of the limbs is often accompanied by painfull cramps. This attitudal hypertonia has a tenndency to decrease or disappear in the supine position and to increase in orthostation. Cog-wheel rigidity is also elisited on the passive movement of all extremities. Gait disturbance is also characteristic in this poisoning. In the severe cases, cook gait has been reported. The patient uses small steps, but has a tendency to elevate the heels and to rotate them outward. He progress without pressing on the flat of his feet, but only upon the metatarsophalangeal articulations, mainly of the fourth and fifth toes. Increased signal in T1-weighted image in the basal ganglia has been reported in patients with the poisoning. Thus, increasd signal intensities as a target site dose can be a more useful biomakers of the manganese than other biological indicies such as ambient manganese concentration or blood manganese concentration on individual basis. Manganese poisoning ultimately becomes chronic. However, if the disease is diagnosed while still at the early stages and the patient is removed from exposure, the course may be reversed. Once well established, it becomes progressive and irreversible, even when exposure is terminated. Levodopa therapy is not effective for the management of manganese poisoning. Levodopa unresponsiveness may be usefull to distinguish manganese-induced parkinsonism from Parkinson disease.

TI  - [Our physiotherapy treatment of articular fractures of the mandibular condyle].
PY  - 2003
AB  - Physical therapy greatly contributes to improved function of the injured temporomandibular joint, particularly after trauma. In our unit, we use the Delaire rehabilitation method for patients presenting a fracture of the mandibular condyles. This method involves active mobilization, first with assistance, then with facilitation, and finally against resistance. A rehabilitation session starts with a preparation of the teguments and muscles associated with relaxation exercises. The joint is first mobilized by assisted movements if needed. When unassisted motion becomes possible, propulsion, diduction and open-close exercises are then performed with neuromuscular facilitation. When sufficient amplitudes have been achieved, the program proceeds with opposed exercises. By inducing propulsion and diduction (lateral pterygoid muscle) movements, physical therapy stimulates regeneration of the condylar unit, thus facilitating optimal functional rehabilitation. Posture and passive motion methods, which in our opinion are poorly adapted to the temporomandibular joint, are used little in our unit. Since condylar regeneration is controlled by functional factors, the lateral pterygoid muscle is an important element. Good functional outcome, and the absence of ankylosis, depends directly on the quality of active rehabilitation.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Swimming activity of cercariae in the trematode species Cryptocotyle lingua, Himasthla elongata, Maritrema subdolum, and Cercaria parvicaudata (Renicola sp.) is studied using video microfilming. The larvae of C. lingua demonstrate a typical intermittent swimming with regularly alternating periods of active movement and passive floating. The duration of both periods during the first 30 min of cercaria's life retains equal, and later the passive period becomes longer. In 15 h the duration of the active period is 0.5-1 s and the passive one--20-30 s. The cercariae of H. elongata during the first 10-15 min of their free life make short stops (1-2 s) in every 10-15 s of swimming. Later these stops become rare and their duration reduces to 0.5-1 s. The cercariae of M. subdolum and C. parvicaudata are continuous swimmers, having left the molluscan host they move persistently. If stops take place they are very rare (one case in 5-15 min) and very short (0.5-1 s). The movements of cercariae body and their tail during swimming are similar in all species studied. The proximal part of the tail undulates in lateral plane, and the middle and distal parts of this organ in the top view circumscribe a figure of eight. In the side view the middle and distal parts of the tail being rotate form a figure like a screw. The cercariae move along the screw axis. The linear swimming rate in the beginning of cercariae's life is 4.8 mm/s for C. lingua, 2.4 mm/s for H. elongata, and 0.35 mm/s for M. subdolum and C. parvicaudata. By the aging the cercariae swimming rate decreases down to the full cease of swimming activity, and the larvae sediment onto the bottom. The age dynamics of swimming rate is different in cercariae of different species and is determined by the morphological functional features of the larvae.

TI  - [Performance diagnosis of the locomotor system and sensory organs?].
PY  - 1989
AB  - The quantitative significance of the sensory organs in sport is discussed by means of the visual parameters static and dynamic visual acuity and the equilibrium that is specific for a particular kind of sport. Spectators with normal visual acuity can identify footballs, tennis balls etc. used in game sports, with relative ease, compared with sports equipment used in athletics. However, since moving objects can attain an angular velocity of 400 degrees/s and higher in certain sports, the mean dynamic visual acuity is unable to cope with such speeds, this being only 200 to 230 degrees/s. Dynamic visual acuity can be trained, thus attaining higher levels in game sports. Processes of balance regulation during cycling (or in rhythmical sports gymnastics) are discussed in connection with and subsequent to the problem of the intersensory perception conflict. Finally, the article sums up criteria for the observation of movement and for minimising intersensory perception conflicts.

At the frequencies of 0.2-1.7 Hz the lead of the level of depolarization was determined by the value of phase changes of afferent activity. Above 1.7 Hz a phase lag of the level of depolarization was observed. This lag was caused by the dynamic properties of PAD generation system.

AB  - A properly conducted rehabilitation of the shoulder after arthroplasty is an inseparable part of the total treatment and is a prerequisite for the achievement of a good functional result. It is suitable to begin with the exercises within 48 hours after the surgery. The initial mobilization of the joint and decompression of the subacromial space the passive motion of the shoulder is exercised. Later the passive exercise is followed by active training aimed at the strengthening of the muscles of the shoulder girdle.The rehabilitation programme has to be tailored to individual patients and controlled by the surgeon who is the only one who can evaluate the condition of the musculoskeletal apparatus of the shoulder, the stability of the fixation of fragments or suture of the rotator cuff. During the whole period of exercising it is necessary to emphasize and check the proper movement stereotype during each exercise session. The same rehabilitation programme may be applied not only in after shoulder arthroplasty but also after anatomical or non-anatomical reconstruction of proximal humerus. Key words: rehabilitation, shoulder arthroplasty.

TI  - [Physiology of nodal tissue and effect of products used in anesthesia].
PY  - 1985
AB  - The three fundamental properties of the nodal tissue, i.e.: excitability, automaticity and conduction of the depolarisation wave, are directly dependent on ionic transmembrane currents. These currents, either active or passive, determine the characteristics of the membrane action potential. Passive ionic movements cross gated transmembrane channels which activation is voltage-dependent, sometimes time-dependent and, for Ca2+ channels, dependent on intra-cellular cyclic AMP content. Both intra and extra-cellular ionic concentrations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) alter these passive movements. Active ionic movements require ATP hydrolysis and depend only on cellular metabolism. The neurovegetative system and its transmitters modulate the nodal tissue function altering passive ionic currents. Drugs employed during anesthesia change this function either by direct action on the ionic currents or by indirect action on the neurovegetative system or on histamine liberation. Thus: local anesthetics block selectively fast sodium channels; halogenated volatile anesthetics inhibit slow calcium channels: and narcotics are quite always vagomimetics, sometimes sympathicolytics, they often release histamine. Nevertheless, mechanism of action of various drugs remain unclear.

The new technique vibration response imaging (VRI) based on the vibration that is generated by airflow in the lung and that is its surrogate manifestation allows visualization of lung function. This method provides clinicians with an easy-to-use, non-radiation, non-invasive acoustic-based imaging technique of visual and quantitative evaluation of the lung. VRI objective dynamic image is a clinical addition to the existing static visual modalities used in the ICU.

Important technical or pragmatic points were analysed separately.RESULTS: Botulinum toxin reduces spasticity of the injected muscles, with a mean gain of about 1 point on the Ashworth scale in the 4 to 6 weeks post injection, but with a large variability. This is associated to an increase in the passive range of motion, especially at wrist, and at times to a facilitation of active movements, when they are still possible. Improvement in functional tests is observed when fair proximal and distal motricity persists. Reduction in the dependence in daily living activities has not been shown by group studies. Several patients have an improvement in using the hand for blocking and transporting objects, mainly in a facilitating position (pronation, partial wrist flexion). Comfort of patients and caregivers is more regularly improved. Results are partially predictable; improvement in function is observed in patients with fair distal motricity (extension) and low spasticity, and improvement in comfort in those with severe spasticity and low motricity.CONCLUSION: Further studies are required, on one hand for better assessment of distal functional improvement, on the other hand at earlier phases of the disease.

TI  - [Postoperative knee joint mobilization in catheter peridural anesthesia following arthrolyses of the knee joint].
PY  - 1985
AB  - The results of arthrolysis of a stiff knee are often poor due to post-operative pain preventing early active mobilization that is so essential. Adequate analgesia may be ensured by the use of continuous anaesthesia via an epidural catheter, and in combination with continuous passive motion such analgesia is able to maintain, and often improve, the range of movement obtained at surgery. 22 patients treated in this way showed an improvement in the range of movement of between 39 and 120 degrees. Patients with post-traumatic knee stiffness achieved an average improvement in the range of movement of 93%, while those with stiffness following infection only improved by 55% on the average. The pre-operative loss of movement does not appear to determine the end result: the aetiology of the stiffness is more important.

TI  - [Precise application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in minimally-invasive techniques].
PY  - 2018
AB  - The miminally-invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) uses different types of acupuncture needles to treat diseased locations with special techniques. These techniques include different methods of insertion and closed incision (press cutting, sliding cutting, scrape cutting, etc.). This needling technique is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories of Pi Bu(cutaneous), Jing Jin(sinew), Jing Luo(meridian), Wu Ti(five body structure components) and Zang Fu(organ system). Commonly used needles include: needle Dao, needle with edge, Pi needle, Shui needle, Ren needle, Gou needle, Chang Yuan needle, Bo needle and so on. The principle of this minimally-invasive technique of TCM is to achieve the greatest healing benefit with the least amount of anatomical and physiological intervention. This will result in the highest standard of health care with the lowest rehabilitative need and burden of care. In the past 20 years, through the collaborative research of several hundred hospitals across China, we systemically reviewed the best minimally invasive technique of TCM and the first line treatments for selective conditions. In 2013, the Department of Medical Affairs of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine created "Traditional Chinese Medicine Technical Manual"(General Version) and released it nationwide, its contents include: (1)Minimally invasive scar tissue release. Suitable for Bi and pain syndromes of neck, shoulder, waist, buttocks and extremities. Degeneration causes local hypertrophy and inflammation, creating local tissue adhesion. There are two kind incision methods-press cutting and slide cutting. (2)Minimally invasive fascial tension release. Suitable for localized fascial tension caused by trauma, overuse, or wind-cold-dampness, leading to compensatory hyperplasia. Long term high-stress stimulation to local fascia creates compensatory hyperplasia, Ashi points, and tissue texture changes (cords, nodules, masses). According to the different structural features of the needles, there are two incision methods: penetrating from the outside to the inside and pulling from inside to outside. (3)Minimally invasive decompression technique. Suitable for internal pressure changes within organ cavities caused by trauma, degeneration, inflammation, such as compartment syndrome, bone marrow edema, increased intraluminal pressure in the bone marrow. According to the different tissues, it is categorized into soft tissue decompression, and bone decompression. (4)Minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. Applicable to some postural, developmental deformity correction, mainly through the dynamic balance method and/or static balance method. (5)Minimally invasive dissection. Suitable for fractures, tendons injury caused by deep soft tissue adhesion. (6)Minimally invasive separation. Suitable for cutaneous, sinew regions, superficial adhesions due to lesions, and local post-operative incision adhesions. According to the structure of the needle tip, the methods are divided into sharp separation and blunt dissection. (7)Minimally invasive sustained pressure technique. Suitable for neuromuscular dysfunction which causes JING(spasm) syndrome and WEI(atrophy) syndrome. The needle is applied with sustained pressure, without penetrating select tissue surface. This includes: nerve root sustained pressure technique; peripheral nerve sustained pressure technique; muscle sustained pressure technique; fascial contact procedure; cutaneous sustained pressure technique.(8)Minimally invasive insertion technique. Suitable for systemic regulation to treat disease. Different organs are connected to different layers of tissue. Therefore, to treat specific conditions, specific tissues must be targeted. For example, back Shu points are used to treat vertigo from cervical spine issues, and spinal degeneration associated digestion issue. ⁴The internal organs can be regulated by the pathways that runs along the different layers of tissue. The types of stimulation include: meridian acupoint stimulation; cutaneous stimulation; fascia stimulation; mucle stimulation; periosteum stimulation. The clinical application of these techniques has enriched the drug-free therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and achieved excellent outcomes, but at the same time it also raises an important question. How can we apply these minimally invasive techniques to clinical practice so it can be safe and effective? In addition, how can practitioners, individually and further develop their understanding of this minimally invasive technique progressive manner? We make the following recommendations. (1)Clear diagnosis and precise application. Any approach has specific indications and choosing the correct technique comes from a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the accurate application of the technique depends the expertise of the practitioner. Through systematic review and clinical observation, we formulated the First Line Treatment, the Second Line Treatment, and the Third Line Treatment for specific conditions. Using the information gathered from research, practitioners can decide on which point is appropriate to use based on the stage of disease progression. For example, common conditions like the nerve ending tension pain(i.e. cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome) is caused by stress concentration. There are two types of treatment for this condition: Change in the response to stress state (i.e.non-invasive approach such as manual therapy and physiotherapy). Change in state of surrounding environment (i.e. invasive approach such as Pi Needle). Before tissue texture changes to pain point, cord, nodules, the former approach is effective. Once tissue texture changes, the latter approach is First Line Treatment. (2)Systematic training and disease progression training. The minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine can treat many kinds of disease. To ensure its safety, organization, progressive development, practitioners are trained systematically and manage their treatment approach through disease hierarchy. Moreover, this technique should be conducted according to its technical difficulty, operating conditions, and expertise of the practitioner. The application of minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine does not depend on the hospitals' administration system or the regulatory college of medical professionals. The minimally invasive techniques of TCM should be taught from easy to difficult, simple to complicated, and requires gradual progression by the practitioners. Eventually, the minimally invasive techniques of TCM's diagnostic and treatment protocol can be created. These protocols are currently available for reference: Forming diagnosis and differential diagnosis for the conditions below requires expert diagnostic and application skills: cerebral palsy; cervical vertigo; cervical headache; cervical precordial pain; other spine-related diseases. The requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques are relatively high, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The conditions below uses minimally invasive orthopedic surgery and dissection: scar contracture deformity; congenital developmental malformations; cervical Bi-syndrome; shoulder pain syndrome; knee Bi-syndrome; low back pain; cervical spondylosis; lumbar disc herniation; avascular necrosis of the femoral head; ankylosing spondylitis. There are no special requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The technical content is mainly decompression and scar tissue release. a)Muscle strain diseases: levator scapulae, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, teres major, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior inferior, piriformis, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus, erector spinae. b)Joint degenerative disorders: frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, tenosynovitis, knee osteoarthritis, and plantar fascitis. c)JING-JIN PI-BU pain syndrome (cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome): occipital great nerve entrapment syndrome, occipital small nerve entrapment syndrome, great auricular nerve entrapment syndrome, suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome, transverse cutaneous nerve of neck entrapment syndrome. (3)People-centred practice. The most attractive feature of the minimally invasive techniques of TCM is that they do not rely on expensive medical equipment and operating conditions. The key to applying this technique is the practitioners' technique, skill, and expertise. The necessary conditions required to successfully apply this technique is practitioner understands disease progression and diagnosis; practitioners' skill in applying technique. We require patient-centered approach, which uses evidence based approach as the focus. We aim to seek the truth from facts, to understand the comprehensive picture, to include pertinent details, to be observant, to be goal oriented, from one to another, from outside to inside, from top to the bottom, compare right from left, through active movement and passive movements and weight-bearing movements, and assisted passive movements to determine instantaneous centre to diagnose stress concentration points. The operating technique is based on the response of patient's tissues to this technique. We must pay attention to diagnosis through palpation: layers, structure, texture, deformity, dislocation, movement characteristic, rhythmic changes. To achieve SHOU MO XIN HUI WU WEI: position, quantify, quantity, timing, and pattern. Accurate grasp of timeliness and dose efficiency. Can distinguish between local or systemic effects of treatment. Through comprehensive judgment of hands feeling, acupuncture needle feeling, and inspiration, to achieve the precious treatment requirements as indicated by the "Huangdi Neijing·Suwen": "Puncture the bone without damaging tendons, and puncture tendons without damaging muscles, puncture the muscle without damaging pulse, puncture pulse without damaging skin, puncture skin without damaging muscle. Puncture muscle without damage tendons, puncture tendons without damaging bone... Puncture bone without damaging tendons and it means the needle passes through the tendons and arrives at the bone and work on the bone. Puncture tendons without damaging muscles, and it means the needle passes through the muscles and arrives close to the tendon. Puncture the muscle without damaging pulse and it means the needle passes the pulse and does not touch the muscle. Puncture pulse without damaging skin and it means, the needle passes through the skin without penetrating pulse. Puncture skin without damaging muscle and it means, the disease is in the skin and the needles insert into skin but does not damage muscle. Puncture muscle without damage tendons, and it means, the needle passes through the muscle and arrive on the tendon. Puncture tendons without damaging bone."

Rehabilitation techniques (postural education, prescription of braces, passive and active movements, respiratory physiotherapy) are described. The Authors assume that the role and effects of treatment vary a great deal, depending on the individual case and the moments of psychological crises. Rehabilitation may delay deterioration and achieve the prevention of evolutional complications: successful results are obtained if the patients and family are given detailed instructions for treatment at home and if a relationship and a close cooperation between the patient and the physiotherapist are established. Specific information and psychological support should be provided, which will cover not only the technical aspects of rehabilitation, but also the concrete problems of daily life and of adjustment in family and society.

AB  - The present evaluations of hand invalidity are based on parameters that can give correct assessment for amputations or for single stiffness, but these parameters are not able to evaluate the majority of lesions. A nerve lesion does not repair at 100% or at 0%; all degrees are possible. The same is true for vascular, tendon and muscular lesions. We studied a new global evaluation on a large number of patients and we compared it with the tables in use today. The assessed parameters are: the active and passive movement, ability of the hand, strength, duration of the effort or of the fatigue, trophism, sensibility, pain, aesthetics.

PY  - 1990
AB  - Changes in pulmonary ventilation and O2-consumption were studied during passive and active extension of both crura. The rate and extent of the movements were the same (1Hz). Thirty 21-year-old men (mean weight 72.5 kg, mean height 179 cm) were divided into 3 equal groups, namely controls, with passive movement, and with active movement. The trial consisted of three 11-12 minute periods--initial, period of movement, and recovery. In the control group movements were not performed. Passive movements were carried out by means of a special lever. Ventilation increased at active movements (12.42 +/- 2.731 compared to control values of 8.62 +/- 2.87). Oxygen consumption was increased during active movements (8.4 +/- 2.3 ml.kg-1.min-1 compared to 4.4 +/- 0.6), yet it was reduced during passive movements (3.5 ml compared to control values of 4.4 and initial values of 4.3 ml). The finding is accounted for by the rapid depression of the metabolic efficacy of isolated proprioceptive afferentation as a specific feature of conditioned reflex regulation of metabolism in man.

The obtained results were compared with the wrist angle in normal children. The increase of the wrist angle was observed in deformations: dwarfism, gargoylism and dysplasia multiplex, and the decrease of this angle in the Turner syndrome. The range of passive and active movements of the wrist was evaluated. Passive and active mobility of the wrist (especially the radial and the ulnar deviations) was smaller in the cases of increased wrist angle.

PY  - 2009
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the operative method and clinical efficacy of reconstructing metacarpophalangeal joint defect by the second toe proximal interphalangeal joint with skin flaps.METHODS: From March 2003 to January 2008, 26 cases (26 fingers) with metacarpophalangeal joint defect were treated, including 19 males and 7 females aged 18-36 years old (average 27 years old). Among them, 23 cases were caused by mechanical injury and the time from injury to operation was 1-6 hours; while 3 cases suffered from secondary injury due to trauma and the time from injury to operation was 3-12 months. Four thumbs, 10 index fingers, 8 middle fingers, 3 ring fingers and 1 little finger were injured. The metacarpophalangeal joint defects were 2 cm x 1 cm - 4 cm x 2 cm in size, and 22 cases were combined with skin and soft tissue defect (1.5 cm x 1.5 cm - 6.0 cm x 5.0 cm). During operation, the second toe proximal interphalangeal joint with skin flaps was transplanted to reconstruct those defects, 20 fingers received whole-joint transplantation and 6 fingers received half-joint transplantation. The skin flaps ranging from 2.0 cm x 1.5 cm to 6.5 cm x 6.0 cm in size were adopted. The donor site of 21 cases received toe amputation, and the rest 5 cases received joint fusion.RESULTS: The transplanted joints and skin flaps of all the 26 fingers survived. All incisions and donor sites healed by first intention. All patients were followed up for 6-20 months (average 12 months). The union of transplanted joints was achieved in all the cases at 6-12 weeks after operation, no bone nonunion and refracture occurred. The flexion range of transplanted metacarpophalangeal joints was 30-75 degrees (average 45 degrees). Joint activity was evaluated according to the total active movement/total passive movement assessment criteria, 8 fingers were excellent, 13 good, 3 fair, 2 poor, and the excellent and good rate was 80.77%. The foot donor-site ability to walk was unaffected.CONCLUSION: Applying second toe proximal interphalangeal joint with skin flaps is an effective approach to reconstruct the metacarpophalangeal joint defect, and the function recovery of the injured joints is satisfying.

TI  - [Rehabilitation after operative treatment with hip joint preservation in adults--own experience].
PY  - 2010
AB  - In the past, the procedure for rehabilitation after hip surgery, related to the long immobilization of the operated joint, was often delayed and limited in time. Today's surgical procedures and rehabilitation allows for a quicker return to full physical fitness. Postoperative physiotherapy is mainly focused on regaining full joint function (range of motion--ROM, strength, stability). The rehabilitation program must be a dynamic process, dosed up to the possibility of the patient, depending on the type of procedure performed. Rehabilitation must take into account not only the type of procedure performed intraarticular, but also surgical approach. Rehabilitation after surgery requiring dislocation of the hip by osteotomy with simultaneous artrotomii trochanter must take into account the time required for the stable union. Range of motion exercises begin in the first days after surgery using a continous passive movement (CPM) and passive exercises, and later a stationary bicycle. Menaging patients after treatment of CAM type femoroacetabular impingement is dependent on the degree of bone resection performed within the femur. In the treatment of Pincer-type f emoroacetabular impingement, as well as injuries of the hip labrum rehabilitation proceedings must take into account the location and the area of pathology. Rehabilitation after surgery for articular cartilage (chondroplasty or osteoplasty) in the first period is mainly focused on the avoidance of intraarticular conflicts in the reconstruction of the full ROM.

PY  - 2001
AB  - We report the results of a retrospective study of 47 adult patients corresponding to 54 fingers, operated on in the emergency room at Nancy University Hospital between December 1996 and October 1998. These patients were managed using three different postoperative therapy protocols: passive mobilisation according to the Duran technique, active-passive mobilisation according to the Kleinert technique and immediate active mobilisation as described by Strickland. Patients were evaluated in three different ways; active range of movement obtained according to the Strickland scale, the "400 points" flexor function test and the delay in returning to work. Combining all three evaluations showed a 65% rate of satisfactory results, 22% fair and bad results and 13% ruptures. Analysis according to the re-education technique showed a strong superiority of the Strickland protocol. This now needs to be confirmed by a more extensive prospective study. Delay before return to work is not affected by the type or re-education technique chosen, but side-effects are less frequent with the Strickland method. A result in terms of range of active movement alone did not fully evaluate the result of a flexor tendon repair: functional testing was better at this end and the global "400" points test score gave more useful information than each of its component tests taken individually (Purdue pegboard, Minnesota test, Box and Block). Functional testing seemed more helpful in guiding the medical team in its treatment strategy.

There were 12 males and 4 females with an average age of 37 years ranging from 18 to 49 years. The defect were caused by machine crush injury 11 cases, pressure injury by heavy objects in 2 cases, crush injury by door of car 1 case, injury by saw in 2 cases. The defect was located in the index finger in 5 cases, the middle finger in 9 cases,the ring finger in 2 cases. All injuries had large pulp defects averaging 1.6 cm (long) x 1.2 cm (wide) to 2.5 cm (long) x 1.7 cm (wide). Short-term results for all patients were reviewed. Outcome measures included static 2-point discrimination, total active motion, and hypersensitivity or cold intolerance.RESULTS: All flaps achieved primary healing with no complications. Sensory recovery was excellent with an average 2-point discrimination of 5.1 mm. All patients were followed-up for 8 to 20 months (averaged 12 months) with highly satisfactory with both aesthetic and functional outcome. There was no hypersensitivity or cold intolerance. According to the evaluation of total active motion (TAM) scales, the results were excellent in 7 cases, good in 8 cases (9 lesions) and fair in 1 case.CONCLUSION: The spiral advancement-transposition flap is suitable for resurfacing large pulp defects with excellent short-term functional and aesthetic results and high patient satisfaction.

TI  - [Restoration of elbow joint flexion using pectoral muscle transfer in patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Part I: surgical method, rehabilitation and clinical results].
PY  - 2002
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: In patients with type I arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, elbows are fixed in extension. The m. biceps brachii and m. brachialis are usually atrophic. The main objective of arm treatment is to restore flexion in the elbow that would enable the patient to reach the mouth with the hand as well as maintain active extension of the arm for hygienic purposes. This can be achieved by several techniques of muscle transfer. Of these, we selected and modified the method of Clark based on transfer of distal parts of the greater pectoral muscle. The aim of this study was to develop the surgical procedure in detail, to design the course of rehabilitation and to evaluate the outcomes of treatment.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The procedure for optimal transfer of three fifths of the m. pectoralis major was based on an anatomical study. In addition, a unified course of rehabilitation was developed. Between 1996 and 1999, this approach was applied to nine upper limbs in five patients (age range, 4.3 to 9 years). All the patients were evaluated in terms of their clinical state according to selected subjective and objective criteria.RESULTS: The outcomes of transfer of the m. pectoralis major were evaluated as very good and good in six cases. Active movement of the elbow was in the range of 15 degrees to 95 degrees; useful movement ranged from 40 degrees to 70 degrees. The strength of elbow flexion rated 4 or 4+. In three cases, although muscle transfer restricted active elbow extension it did not prevent the upper limb from being used for hygienic purposes. In the remaining three cases, the method failed to restore the patient's ability of reaching the mouth. The analysis of unsuccessful results showed that these were always related to a very limited pre-operative passive flexion of the elbow, restricted movement of the shoulder joint and a failure in distal fixation of the muscle transposed.DISCUSSION: Our results show that transfer of the distal three fifths of the m. pectoralis major, performed by a modified method of Clark, was an effective approach because the working capacity of this muscle was comparable with those of the m. biceps brachii and m. brachialis. Bilateral transfer enabled the patients to reach the mouth with both hands and to use the remaining elbow extension for hygienic purposes. The best function was achieved when active movement of the shoulder had permitted raising the arm above the horizontal and passive elbow flexion had been 90 degrees. Our results are comparable with those reported in the literature. The critical phase of this transfer involved fixation of the m. pectoralis major to the forearm.CONCLUSIONS: The surgical procedure for transfer of the m. pectoralis major and subsequent rehabilitation in patients with type I arthrogryposis are described in detail. Good results are achieved in patients who, pre-operatively, had passive movement of the elbow joint and active movement of the shoulder joint. The method is not suitable for patients with a markedly limited pre-operative movement of both the elbow and the shoulder in whom an alternative surgical treatment should be used.

PY  - 2007
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alleviation of pain, restoration of function and active range of motion.INDICATIONS: Failed posttraumatic shoulder prostheses with insufficient rotator cuff, pseudoparalysis, chronic instability, severe ankylosis.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Advanced glenoid destruction. Severe lesions of the deltoid muscle (> 50%) and axillary nerve palsy. Florid infections.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Deltopectoral approach. Exposure of the failed implant and explantation by fenestration of the humerus. Periarticular release with preservation of neurovascular structures. Exposure of the glenoid, cementless fixation of the glenoid base plate (metaglene) and application of the glenoid ball (glenosphere). Fenestration of the humeral shaft, removal of bone cement, placement of wire and suture loops, and cemented implantation of the humeral component (long revision stem) in 10-30 degrees retroversion related to the long axis of the forearm. Anatomic reconstruction of the soft tissues with preservation of the external rotators (reattachment of dislocated tubercles and, if necessary, transposition of latissimus dorsi and teres major as described by L'Episcopo).POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: For 6 weeks postoperatively, abduction brace and passive or active-assisted exercises including continuous passive motion (Ormed, Freiburg, Germany).RESULTS: From 2000 to 2005, a total of 84 shoulder replacement revisions were performed with the reverse prosthesis, of which 34 were revisions of failed fracture hemiarthroplasties (five men, 29 women) through a bone window in the humerus. 25 patients were followed prospectively for up to 59 months postoperatively; an additional nine patients were interviewed by telephone or in writing (n=34, average age 68 years [59-82 years], average follow-up 31.5 months [12-59 months]). The preoperative age- and gender-related Constant Score was 17.5% and improved to 63% postoperatively. Range of motion for active elevation and internal rotation was substantially improved (average elevation preoperatively 48 degrees , postoperatively 125 degrees ). Pain was relieved in every patient. Function correlated to the extent of soft-tissue damage. 14 patients were very satisfied with the surgical outcome, 16 were satisfied and four dissatisfied. There were eight complications in total.

TI  - [Short-term effectiveness of Kirschner wire elastic fixation in treatment of Doyle type Ⅰ and Ⅱ mallet finger].
PY  - 2017
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of Kirschner wire (K-wire) elastic fixation in the treatment of Doyle type Ⅰ and Ⅱ mallet finger.Methods: Between July 2016 and March 2017, 18 patients with Doyle type Ⅰ and Ⅱ mallet finger were treated. There were 12 males and 6 males, with an average age of 45 years (range, 16-61 years). The index finger was involved in 2 cases, the middle finger in 3 cases, the ring finger in 10 cases, and the little finger in 3 cases. The interval from injury to operation ranged from 2 hours to 45 days (median, 5.5 hours). There were 8 patients of closed wound and 10 patients of open wound. Fourteen patients were simply extensor tendon rupture and 4 were extensor tendon rupture complicated with avulsion fracture. The distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJ) of injured fingers were elastically fixed with the K-wire at mild dorsal extend position. The K-wire was removed after 6 weeks, and the functional training started.Results: The operation time was 34-53 minutes (mean, 38.9 minutes). Patients were followed up 3-8 months (mean, 5 months). All incisions healed primarily and no K-wire loosening or infection happened during the period of fixation. All mallet fingers were corrected. The range of motion (ROM) in terms of active flexion of injured DIPJ was (75.83±11.15)° at 6 weeks after operation, showing significant difference when compared with the normal DIPJ of contralateral finger [(85.28±6.06)°] ( t=3.158, P=0.003). The ROM in terms of active flexion was (82.67±6.78)° in 15 patients who were followed up at 8 months after operation, showing no significant difference when compared with the normal DIPJ of contralateral finger [(86.00±5.73)°] ( t=1.454, P=0.157). After the removal of K-wire at 6 weeks, visual analogue scale (VAS) score of active flexion and of passive flexion to maximum angle were 1.78±0.88 and 3.06±1.06, respectively. According to the total active motion criteria, the effectiveness was rated as excellent in 10 cases, good in 5 cases, moderate in 2 cases, and poor in 1 case, and the excellent and good rate was 83.33%. The patients' satisfaction were accessed by Likert scale, which were 3-5 (mean, 4.2).Conclusion: K-wire elastic fixation in the treatment of Doyle typeⅠand Ⅱ mallet finger can repair the extensor effectively, correct the mallet finger deformity, and also be benefit for the flexion-extension function restoration of DIPJ.目的: 探讨克氏针弹性固定治疗 DoyleⅠ、Ⅱ型锤状指的近期疗效。.方法: 2016 年 7 月2017 年 3 月，收治 DoyleⅠ、Ⅱ型锤状指 18 例。男 12 例，女 6 例；年龄 16～61 岁，平均 45 岁。损伤指别：示指 2 例，中指 3 例，环指 10 例，小指 3 例。受伤至手术时间 2 h～45 d，中位时间 5.5 h。闭合性损伤 8 例，开放性损伤 10 例。单纯指伸肌腱断裂 14 例，伴撕脱性骨折的伸肌腱止点断裂 4 例。采用克氏针弹性跨关节固定远节指间关节（distal interphalangeal joints，DIPJ）于过伸位，6 周后去除克氏针并进行功能锻炼。.结果: 手术时间 34～53 min，平均 38.9 min。患者均获随访，随访时间 3～8 个月，平均 5 个月。术后切口均Ⅰ期愈合；患指固定期间未发生克氏针松动、针眼处感染。患者锤状指畸形均得到纠正，术后 6 周拔除克氏针后，DIPJ 被动活动无明显受限，主动屈曲角度为（75.83±11.15）°，与健侧对应指（85.28±6.06）° 比较，差异有统计学意义（ t=3.158， P=0.003）。术后 8 个月，15 例获随访患者患指 DIPJ 主动屈曲角度为（82.67±6.78）°，与健侧对应指（86.00±5.73）° 比较，差异无统计学意义（ t=1.454， P=0.157）。术后 6 周拔除克氏针后，DIPJ 主动屈曲时疼痛视觉模拟评分（VAS）为（1.78±0.88）分，被动屈曲至最大关节活动度时 VAS 评分为（3.06±1.06）分。术后 3 个月，根据总主动活动度（TAM）评定标准，获优 10 例、良 5 例、中 2 例、差 1 例，优良率为 83.33%；患者满意度 Likert 评分为 3～5 分，平均 4.2 分。.结论: 克氏针弹性固定治疗 DoyleⅠ、Ⅱ型锤状指，能有效修复指伸肌腱，纠正锤状指畸形，利于远期 DIPJ 屈伸功能恢复。.

TI  - [Single-stage flexor tendoplasty in the treatment of flexor tendon injuries].
PY  - 2004
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated tendon reconstruction with one-stage tendon grafting in flexor tendon injuries in which primary repair was not considered because of delay in treatment or of inappropriate circumstances on the part of the wound and the patient.METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (29 males, 8 females; mean age 20.5 years; range 4 to 52 years) underwent single-stage flexor tendoplasty involving 41 fingers. Twenty-eight patients had zone II injuries. The mean duration from trauma to surgery was one month (range 3 to 6 weeks). Tendon grafts were obtained from the palmaris longus in 26 repairs, flexor digitorum superficialis in 14 repairs, and flexor carpi radialis in one repair. Early passive rehabilitation was administered after surgery. Improvement in the flexion motion was calculated using the Strickland formula. The results were compared with respect to the tendon graft used, associated nerve injuries, and the age of the patients (equal to or below 10 years/above 10 years). The mean follow-up was 35 months (range 4 to 83 months).RESULTS: Functional results were excellent in 12 fingers (29.3%), good in 13 fingers (31.7%), moderate in 14 fingers (34.2%), and poor in two fingers (4.9%). Overall, the mean total active movement was 57% (range 22 to 88%). No significant differences were found between the functional results with respect to the tendon graft used, associated nerve injuries, and the age of the patients (ANOVA, p>0.05).CONCLUSION: Single-stage flexor tendoplasty seems to be an appropriate choice of treatment for flexor tendon injuries where local wound conditions and decreased tendon length prevent primary repair, provided that the pulley system remains intact.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Injuries and degenerative alterations of the shoulder predominantly affect the soft tissue. To investigate this area we use a multitude of diagnostic examinations: apart from clinical and functional diagnosis also the image reproductive methods of arthrography, ultrasound and computer tomography in addition to the classical X-ray. To ascertain pathological changes to shoulder soft tissue the simplest and quickest, least dangerous and most straightforward examination is the sonograph as it includes dynamic movement procedures. Warning: a high degree of experience and anatomical knowledge is a must! Computer- and especially nuclear spin tomography--being static examining forms a comprehensive picture of every anatomic structure and its pathology--may well represent a valuable addition to shoulder diagnostics. Nevertheless, as yet the clinical and material requirements are still enormous.

TI  - [Somatotopy in the basal ganglia].
PY  - 2009
AB  - Somatotopy is a fundamental concept that is essential for the understanding of the functions of the brain. Here, I have described somatotopy in the basal ganglia that comprise the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Projections from the motor cortical subregions that represent different body parts terminate in different regions of these nuclei. Basal ganglia neurons respond not only to the stimulation of the corresponding subregions of the motor cortices but also to the active and passive movements of the corresponding body parts. On the basis of these anatomical and physiological findings, somatotopy can be identified in the motor territories of these nuclei in the basal ganglia. In addition, projections from functionally interrelated cortical areas partially converge through a cortico-basal ganglia loop. Disorganized somatotopy may explain, at least in part, the pathophysiology of movement disorders such as Parkinson disease and dystonia.

TI  - [Space and spatial orientation].
PY  - 2003
AB  - Space and spatial orientation has been a subject of interest of researchers for many years. Spatial orientation can be divided into cued navigation and place navigation. The latter requires more complex neuronal computations and is considered to be a model of higher cognitive functions in animals. Allothetic orientation is based on determining the location of the subject with respect to orientating cues and gradients in its surrounding. Idiothetic orientation involves integrating the information generated during active and passive self-motion in order to obtain the actual position of the subject with respect to the starting point. This article reviews the historical evolution of spatial concepts, the types of orientation, and their neuronal implementation. Description of the most widely used methods of studying mechanisms of spatial orientation is also included.

PY  - 2002
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exercise training is recommended for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to improve the endurance capacity. While many patients confined to bed are not able to run exercise training, we investigated the influence of a bedside passive-ergometry on ventilation in patients with severe COPD.METHODS: In nine patients with severe COPD confined to bed (FEV1.0 0,94 +/- 0,18 l, IVC 2,3 +/- 0,8 l, Raw 0,91 +/- 0,13 kPa/l/s) we measured oxygen uptake O2, breathing frequency BF and minute ventilation E during rest, passive movement (30 revolutions per minute), additional active movement and maximal exercise. As a control group six healthy men were investigated during rest and passive movement.RESULTS: During maximal exercise in COPD patients O2 peak reached 618 +/- 177 ml/min, BF 26 +/- 7,2/min and E max 24,1 +/- 5 l/min. In rest O2 was 311 +/- 56 ml/min (53 % O2 peak), BF 17,6 +/- 3,1/min and E 13,3 +/- 2,7 ml/min (55 % E max), while during passive movement O2 was increased to 369 +/- 88 (62 % O2 peak), BF to 19 +/- 5,3 and E to 16,4 +/- 4,1 (68 % E max). In contrast O2 in control subjects dropped from 377,5 +/- 38 in rest to 336 +/- 27 ml/min during passive action, BF from 14 +/- 2,1 to 12 +/- 2,4/min and E from 11,1 +/- 1,3 to 9,1 +/- 1 ml/min.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COPD oxygen uptake, breathing frequency and minute ventilation increased not only during active, but even during passive movement of a bedside ergometer. With this method an exercise training is possible even in COPD patients confined to bed.

PY  - 2003
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of adhesions that restrain tendon gliding is based on early mobilization techniques. Such approach, anyway, does not guarantee positive outcomes.METHODS: Seventy-five patients for a total number of 98 flexors tendons have been treated at the University Hospital of Messina between December 1993 and January 2000. Twenty-five patients, for a total number of 26 tendons, have been seen at follow-up. Seventeen lesions involved zone 2 and 9 involved zone 1. The modified Kessler suture has been generally used. All the repairs have been followed by an adequate early mobilization protocol, according to Kleinert (passive extension/active flexion) in nine patients and according to Risitano and Savage (active extension/active flexion) in 16.RESULTS: Minimum follow-up was 12 months. We present results with an assessment performed according to Strickland and to Elliot for lesion in zone 1 and according to Strickland and using Total Active Motion of the finger for lesions in zone 2.CONCLUSIONS: The suturing technique and mobilization protocol did not affect results, but we made some considerations about respective advantages and disadvantages of either method.

TI  - [Technic for surgical reconstruction in comminuted fractures of the head of the radius].
PY  - 1980
AB  - Osteosynthesis n comminuted fracture of the head of the radius is extremely difficult because of the small size of the bone fragments. The particularly rich innervation of the elbow explains the violent vasomotor reaction that accompanied injuries of the elbow, reaction responsible in the last instance of the onset of biological alterations the articulation. For this reason, the therapeutical solutions must have in view rapid restoring of the passive and active movements of the elbow. Reactions of the radius head is often followed by ossification around the radius stump, subluxation of the inferior articulation and valgus of the ulna. Osteosynthesis is only possible if there is a single detached bone fragment in posterioexternal position with respect to the radius head circumference. The authors describe an original technique, i.e. reducing the fractured bone fragments which are then fixed with a Kirschner rod, brought out percutaneously. A description is given of the operative procedure and postoperative care in the first eight patients operated. Very good results were obtained in 4 case, good results in 3 and poor results in one case.

PY  - 1999
AB  - Molecular biology gives a static--not a dynamic--vision of the mechanisms regulating gene expression. Genetics already gave to time a limited place in the explanation of living phenomena. Such a static vision is supported by the techniques--such as X-ray crystallography--used by the biologists. However time is an important parameter in the control of gene expression during the cellular response to external signals, during life and aging of organisms or even in the succession of living forms which takes place in evolution. Models are slowly moving, due to the eruption of new technologies giving access to the fast events which occur inside living cells. A new dynamic vision is progressively replacing the old one. The consequences of these changes on the form of the future biology remain still unknown.

PY  - 1993
AB  - Between 1970 and 1988, 115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent flexor tenosynovectomy. Fifty patients were reviewed (64 hands). The diagnosis of flexor tenosynovitis remains a clinical diagnosis. Three main groups can be distinguished: isolated carpal tenosynovitis (20%), palmodigital tenosynovitis (50%), diffuse tenosynovitis (30%). Standard surgical techniques were used, particularly in terms of the incisions. All patients underwent rehabilitation in the same rehabilitation centre. The authors analyse their results by comparing overall preoperative and postoperative mobility of the fingers (TAM: Total Active Motion, TPM: Total Passive Motion) and the angular gain in each joint (MCP, PIP, DIP). They report the results obtained at 4 months to eliminate the bias related to progression of the disease. The long-term results (8 years of follow-up) are also analysed. Statistical analysis compares two groups depending on whether flexor tenosynovectomy was isolated (44%) or combined with a dorsal surgical procedure at the same operation (extensor synovectomy, articular synovectomy, stabilisation-realignment of the dorsal aspect of the wrist, resection of the ulnar head) (56%). Ninety percent of patients declared themselves to be subjectively improved. Objectively, mobility was always improved at 4 months then deteriorated to return to its preoperative level at 8 years. Only three patients were reoperated for recurrence. Flexor tenosynovectomy in rheumatoid arthritis is an excellent operation. Its analgesic effect is maintained in time and, when performed early, it appears to protect the patient from the risk of subsequent tendon rupture.

PY  - 2013
AB  - UNLABELLED: The detachment of subclavian artery from brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian vein from right brachiocephalic vein with brachial plexus injury.INTRODUCTION: Traumas of large vessels of mediastinal and shoulder girdle cause significant life risk and constitute serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems because of lack of time for accurate treatment planning. Particularly difficult to treat are blunt trauma of large arteries in patients under the influence of drugs or with a progressive hypovolemic shock.AIM: The aim of this dissertation is presenting my own experience in treating a seventeen-year-old motorcyclist who was under the influence of alcohol suffered a detachment of subclavian artery and subclavian vein from mediastinal large vessels following a traffic accident.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen-year-old motorcyclist who was under the influence of alcohol alcohol hit a concrete pole at a speed of 130 km/h. The patient was brought to the hospital in a state of hypovolemic shock, pulse 126/min, blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, without pulse on the right upper limb. The right upper limb was cold, without active movements, pressure and pain sense. The right shoulder was tumid. The right lung without audible murmurs. Pulses on carotid arteries were perceptible. The thoracic plain film x-ray showed a shading on right half of thorax, widening of the upper mediastinum, fracture of right clavicle and the rear right shoulder sprain. Passive movements in the right elbow were correct. The patient was taken to the operating theatre because of progressive hypovolemic shock and was operated in emergency regimen. The transverse thoracotomy was made by both the intercostals spaces between the second and third rib. The thoracotomy showed that subclavian artery from brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian vein from right brachiocephalic vein were detachment. The subclavian vein was ligated and the brachiocephalic vein was sewn (phleborrhaphy). The subclavian artery was connected with brachiocephalic trunk by a synthetic vascular graft so that the received pulse at the periphery of the upper limb. The thyrocervical trunk, costocervical trunk and damaged intercostal vessels at the first, second and third rib were also ligated. The sprained shoulder was set. During the operation, there was no sight that even one of fascicles of brachial plexus was interrupted. The next day pateint was reoperated because of hemorrhage to right pleura. The rest of intercostal vessels at the first, second and third rib were ligated.RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful surgery. After operation was found that ulnar and radial nerve were demaged. The right lung expansion was achieved, upper limb had pulse, wounds healed as needed. The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical treatment.CONCLUSION: The quick decision to conduct operations without accurate diagnosis was the only factor for patient survival.

AB  - Responses of rat barrel-field cortex neurons were recorded during vibrissae deflection, voluntary movements of whiskers and vibrissae movements produced by stimulation of the motor cortex and facial muscles. Changes in the patterns of responses of the three groups of neurons were revealed during the performance of active vibrissae movements: neurons with short-latency responses, neurons with long-latency responses and neurons with changes in the activity occurred early before the movements onset. It is suggested that somatosensory cortical neurons receive peripheral (from the whiskers' follicles and facial muscles) as well as central (from the motor cortex) inputs that modulate their activity.

TI  - [The impact of long-term isolation on visual acuity].
PY  - 1997
AB  - During the experiment with 90- and 7-day isolation and confinement tests were applied to evaluate, along with static, expositional and dynamic (DVA) visual acuity using automated system VZGLIAD (Gaze). Test distance was 1 meter. To assess DVA, the subjects were requested to make oscillatory movements with the head in the horizontal plane with a metronome frequency at 1 Hz. An upward trend in static visual acuity was interpreted as a result of myopization engendered by exposure to confinement and video display. A significant loss in expositional (and dynamic) visual acuity was stated in the main (p > 0.01) and visiting (p > 0.1) crews. These shifts could be associated with the dominance of inhibitory processes in the visual cortex due to monotony of the visual environment and insufficient oculomotor and accommodative activities.

TI  - [The mid-term results of proximal row carpectomy in the treatment of degenerative wrist joint derangements].
PY  - 2004
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the mid-term results of proximal row carpectomy (PRC) in patients who underwent treatment for wrist joint derangements.METHODS: Nine patients (4 men, 5 women; mean age 38 years; range 23 to 66 years) underwent PRC to relive pain in the wrist joint and to improve motion and grip strength. Indications for surgery were acute transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation in one patient, formerly unreduced perilunate fracture dislocation in one patient, Kienbock's disease in four patients, and scaphoid nonunion associated with scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) in three patients. The duration of the symptoms ranged from eight months to 10 years. The results were assessed with the use of pre- and postoperative clinical and radiographic studies, and measurements of active and passive motion, grip strength, and pulp and key pinch strengths. The mean follow-up was 35.4 months (range 13.5 to 72 months).RESULTS: Postoperatively, pain relief was achieved in all the patients and no complications were encountered in the early period. One patient with acute transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation developed radiocapitate joint degeneration three years after surgery and underwent total wrist arthrodesis. Compared to the uninvolved side, wrist functions were found adequate with painless motion, except for passive radial deviation which exhibited a significant decrease (p<0.05). Age, sex, and the duration of symptoms did not influence postoperative results.CONCLUSION: In selected patients with wrist joint derangement, PRC enables painless and adequate motion and grip strength for daily activities. However, radial styloidectomy seems to be necessary to prevent restriction in radial deviation.

TI  - [The quantitative assessment of functional disorders of the hand and upper limb].
PY  - 1999
AB  - Methods have been developed for calculation of quantitative indicators of the hand and upper limb function, which rely on measurement of sensitivity of fingers, the pick-objects-up test (a modified Moberg test), measurement of active and passive movements of joints, hand grips. The following quantitative indicators are computable from formulae: sensitivity, motor function of joints, grips/grasps, coordination of movements. Based on the above four indicators is computation of the integral function of the hand and upper extremity. Computation procedure for quantitative determinants of the upper limb function has been approved of in 156 patients with sequelae of injuries. For a comparative analysis an assessment was performed in these patients of the nerve function by the scoring scale M0-M5, S0-S5, and of the tendon function by the methodology of the American Association of surgeons of the hand and as recommended by Strickland J. W. (1989). The proposed methodology significantly reflects the principal determinants of the function, secures quantitative data on different aspects and integral determinants of the function of the hand and upper extremity.

PY  - 2003
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of zone II flexor tendon injuries treated by primary repair and early rehabilitation in children under the age of 14 years.METHODS: The study included 25 digits of 23 patients (12 boys, 11 girls; mean age 7 years; range 2 to 14 years) with appropriate follow-up. Sixteen patients underwent surgery within the first 24 hours, while the remaining patients had surgery in a mean of three days (range 2 to 14 days). Digital nerve injuries were detected in 10 digits (40%). Repair of the tendons was performed with the use of a modified Kessler technique followed by an above-elbow stabilization splint. Passive flexion-extension exercises were started on the postoperative first day according to the Duran technique. The results were evaluated according to the Glocovac and Strickland's criteria. The mean follow up period was 49 months (range 12 to 92 months).RESULTS: Functional results were excellent in 18 digits (72%), good in five digits (20%), fair in one digit (4%), and poor in one digit (4%). The mean total active movement was 78.5% (range 0% to 100%). No significant differences were observed in functional results with regard to age groups and the presence or absence of digital nerve injuries (p>0.05). No occurrences of infection were encountered.CONCLUSION: The results show that primary repair and early passive mobilization of zone II flexor tendon injuries in children yield satisfactory results.

TI  - [The sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport of the cell membrane].
PY  - 1998
AB  - Discovery and active exploration of the furosemid-sensitive derived-active co-transport of sodium-potassium-chlorine ions took place in the end of 1970-es-1980-es. This transportation mechanism was discovered in various types of cells, both of plant and of animal origin. This review describes properties of the transportation process, which was most comprehensive explored in experiments with erythrocytes, epithelium cells and muscles. The review covers the following properties: anion and cation selectivity of the chlorine transportation, its sensitivity to the specific blocking agents (furocemid, bumetanid, etc.), stoichiometry of the transportation process, etc. For energy source, the chlorine transportation is based on transmembrane electrochemical gradient for sodium ions. The article provides the most recent results of investigation of the chemical nature of the molecule of the chlorine membrane transport. Based on various studies, the molecule of this protein weighs from 120 to 200 kD, includes about 1200 amino acid residua, and forms long cytoplasmatic NH2 and COOH-termini. The gene encoding the amino acid sequence has been cloned. The article discusses the issues of regulation of the chlorine transportation. Humoral control of intensity of the chlorine transportation has been mostly studied in experiments with plain muscles, the issues related to nervous regulation--with only skeleton muscle fibers. The article provides specific data on the mechanisms of the above types of the physiological regulation of active chlorine transportation. In general, the humoral factors, which increase the intracellular concentration of cAMF stimulate chlorine transportation. On the contrary, the hormones, which increase concentration of cGMF in cytoplasm reduce its activity in plain muscles. The discussion of the mechanisms of the nervous controls of the chlorine transportation in the skeleton muscles includes the original results of the author. These results indicate that the suppressive influence of the motor innervation on intensity of the chlorine transportation involves the non-quantum acetilcholine and glutamate secreted from the motor nerves. These agents produce Ca(2+)-dependent molecules of nitrogen oxide in sarcoplasm, which act in the retrograde mode on the nervous terminal and activate there the synthesis of cGMF. Disruption of this bilateral transsynaptic signalization resulting from cutting a nerve of blocking of its axoflow creates more active chlorine transportation and subsequent de-innervation changes in properties of the muscle fibers. The functions of chlorine transportation, which are best studies as of today and therefore, discussed in more detail in the review, include participation of this process in the regulatory rehabilitation of the volume of various cells in non-isotonic medium, and the role of chlorine transportation in development of a negative charge at the interior side of membrane of the skeleton muscle fibers. The former function essentially means that dehydration of a cell in the hypertonic medium increases activity of the sodium, potassium and chlorine co-transport directed to the cell, resulting in increase of the amount of the osmosis-active cytoplasm material, and inflow of water, which fully restores the cell volume in these conditions. Starting from the pioneer studies by Hodgkin and Horowicz [correction of Hojkin and Gorovits], the role of chlorine ions in forming a charge on the membrane of excited cells has been generally interpreted as exclusively passive. I.e., distribution of these ions over both sides of membrane was assumed as equilibrium with the existing values of the membrane potential in the non-excited state. The review provides data obtained in the recent decade, which have proved that the non-excited membrane potential in muscle fibers is co-created by the diffusional potassium and chlorine potential.

TI  - [The treatment of functional disorders of the hand and fingers after gunshot lesions].
PY  - 1947
AB  - Report on 101 cases: (1) Disorders caused by anatomical lesions in parts other than the wrist; amongst these were 59 neurogenic contractures and four desmo-myogenic contractures. The neurogenic contractures were due to section, neurosis, scarring or inflammation of the radial, median or ulnar nerves; (2) disorders caused by lesions of the wrist or the fingers. Six cases presented pseudo-arthrosis of the forearm and 16 gunshot osteomyelitis of the bones of the arm. In three cases the radial nerve was involved in a callus. Operative liberation of the nerve was carried out, but not earlier than six months after recovery from the osteomyelitis. The pseudo-arthrosis cases were treated by bone plasty and if needed autotransplantations. Only after successful surgery of the pseudo-arthrosis liberation of the nerve was performed. Nerve suture was done in the section cases. If a defect was present, Assalhy's technique was used. In seven cases formalinized human nerve was used as a prosthesis, but with poor results. Neuromata of side branches were sectioned subperineurally. Neurolysis was done if the nerve was involved in scar tissue. As was seen by others, suture of the radial nerve was most likely to be successful, followed by the median and lastly by the ulnar nerve. Chronaximetry was done in all cases prior to and repeatedly after operation. The condition improved as early as three to five days after neurolysis or operation of lateral neuromata. After these operations the trophic disorder would disappear simultaneously. One instance is given where neurolysis of a branch of the ulnar nerve led to healing in five days of several trophic ulcers on the fingers, and restoration of the sensitivity of the ulnar zone followed sometime afterwards. If contractures were present, a plaster of Paris cast was made in order to help the paralysed muscle groups. In cases of palsy of the radial nerve with contracture, tendon transplantation of the flexor muscles to the dorsal side was used, or operations of the Perthes type were carried out. These operations are necessary to avoid secondary degenerations in the paralysed tissues which may, even after regeneration of the nerve, cause the contracture to persist. Medical gymnastics must be carried out systematically. In three cases neurogenic contractures of the hand cleared up after sequestrotomy and further treatment of the osteomyelitis of the forearm without any intervention on the nerve. Two cases of desmo- and myogenic contractures were healed by conservative procedures (hot baths and medical gymnastics). Two others were prepared by these measures for ultimate operation, e.g. Morestin's operation. As to reflex contractures, only one such case was seen. The differential diagnosis from malingering is difficult. This generally develops after relatively slight injuries. Muscular tonus is increased as a rule. Vegetative disorders are common: acrocyanosis, hyperhidrosis, hypertrichosis, oedema, osteoporosis and muscle atrophy. Passive movements cause pain. There is no spontaneous pain. The author proposes the term 'inadequate contracture' in which group a place should be reserved for the emotional functional contracture. In the author's case strong suggestion was used and ultimately, after a week's plaster of Paris in corrected position and intensive physiotherapy, the result was gratifying. In the second group there were eight cases of dermato-desmo-myogenic contractures caused by scar tissue involving tendons, sometimes accompanied by arthritis of the interphalangeal joints. Extension contracture of the four fingers with preservation of movement of the thumb should be treated by energetic physiotherapy. Operation should be limited to excision of scar tissue and liberation of tendons. Forcible correction should be done with the utmost care and only in exceptional cases; it should never tear tissues, but only stretch them, and sometimes in stages. Arthrogenic contractures often arise as a consequence of prolonged Immobilization. Muscle atrophy, exsiccation of the synovial membrane and retraction of the joint capsules are the main features. Physiotherapy should be used. Passive and active movements are fundamental, and a variety of simple constructions should be used to facilitate their repetition. All should have a 'working' character. Force and adroitness should be aimed at alike. The author uses a wooden 'ladder' to exercise the fingers, the steps being placed at different intervals and enabling progressive spreading of the fingers. A Kramer splint may be used for the same purpose, but a wooden instrument is to be preferred: a wooden roll, rolling pins of various sizes, a wooden last to spread the fingers, etc., etc. Concurrently physiotherapy consists of application of heat in every form: hot baths, sollux, infrared, paraffin, and less often diathermy and ultrashort-waves. Liberal use is made of ultra-violet light and massage. Paraffinotherapy should last for several hours consecutively, sometimes even for 15 to 24 hours (Kaznelson). In severe pain novocaine electrophoresis is invaluable. Seven per cent of the cases had to be treated with extraction of foreign bodies. It is indicated where function is abolished and may be restored by the extraction, sometimes for psychial reasons and also when infection is present or when the foreign body is near an important vessel or nerve. Osteomyelitis was present 16 times, especially at the wrist. It was treated either conservatively or by operation (generally by resection of joints or extirpation of bones). Six cases were treated for lesions of the amputation stump, excision of painful scar tissue or osteophytes, etc. Plastic skin restoration (Davis, Dragstedt-Wilson or Italian method) may be necessary, as also phalangization of the midhand.

PY  - 1993
AB  - According to information processing theory, attention deficits appear to be a nuclear disorder in schizophrenia which the study has been renewed with the development of neurophysiology technique. The originality of our research was to study in a same subject Event-Related-Potentials in three different conditions: passive and active auditory oddball paradigm for Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P 300, and a simple reaction time task with warming stimulus for the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV). The study was carried out among 20 schizophrenic subjects (paranoid subtype with acute exacerbation, DSM-III-R) and 20 healthy volunteers. Patients differed from controls as the following: a lower amplitude of N1-P2 components of the auditive evoked potentials, a lower amplitude of MMN (absent in 20% of the psychotic subjects), a lower amplitude and a longer latency of P300, and a lower amplitude of CNV. These results suggest a fundamental dysfunction of information processing which involves the early stages of automatic and voluntary attentional cognitive processes in schizophrenia.

PY  - 2017
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the quality of life in the patients of post-stroke shoulder pain treated with the touching-periosteum needling technique of the meridian muscle region theory.METHODS: One hundred and six cases of post-stroke shoulder pain were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 53 cases in each one. In the observation group, the touching-periosteum needle technique and the rehabilitation training were used on the bases of the theory of meridian muscle region. The points were Jianyuci, Binaoci, Jianliaoci, Jianqianci, Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10) and Waiguan (TE 5) on the affected side. The needles were inserted obliquely, at 45°degrees at those extra points to the tendon knots till the needle tips touching periosteum. The needles were manipulated to ensure the qi arrival and then retained for 30 min. The rehabilitation was applied, such as the anti-spasmodic posture, bridge-style movement on the bed, weight transition and balance training, joint activity maintenance training, passive and active movement of shoulder joint, the training for activities of daily living (ADL) and Bobath technique. In the control group, the routine acupuncture and the rehabilitation training were used. The acupints were Jianyu (LI 15), Binao (LI 14), Jianliao (TE 14), Jianqian (Extra), Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10) and Waiguan (TE 5). The rehabilitation training was the same as the observation group. The treatment was given once every day, 6 treatments a week. After 20 treatments, the visual analogue scale (VAS), Fugl-Meyer (FMA) score and Barthel (MBI) score were adopted to evaluate the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the ADL. The clinical therapeutic effects were evaluated in the two groups.RESULTS: The VAS scores were reduced after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups, and FMA and MBI scores were all increased as compared with those before treatment, indicating the significant difference statistically (P<0.05, P<0.01). After treatment, the improvements in the observation group were better than those in the control group (all P<0.05). The curative and remarkably effective rate was 69.8% (37/53) in the observation group, better than 47.2% (25/53) in the control group (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The touching-periosteum needling technique of the meridian muscle region theory obviously improves the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the quality of life in patients of post-stroke shoulder pain. The therapeutic effects are better than the routine acupuncture.

TI  - [Torsion movements of the human eye. IV. Passive body movements, effect of skeletal muscle reflexes, opticokinetic torsion tracking]
PY  - 1978
AB  - A comparative study of torsional movement of the eye in passive and active tilting of the head and body of the object was carried out. Similarity of torsional movement of the eyes in passive and active movements was shown. It was found by the method of exclusion and selective stimulation of vestibular, cervikal, lumbar optokinetic reflexes, that neither the cervikal, nor lumbar reflexes elicited spontaneous torsional movements of the eyes and had no influence on them. A direct study (coinciding with rotation direction of the stimulus of head rotation) and the reverse (noncoinciding) torsional tracing of a rotating disc and tracing without head movements was investigated. During direct tracing depression of saccades and extention of the slow phase of torsion was found; during the reverse one--a decrease of the eye drist and increase of the amplitude and number of saccades. Phenomena of a seeming acceleration and deceleration of disc rotation etc. have been observed. It was found that with torsional saccades vision was retained. The presence of optokinetic control of phases of torsional eye movements formation has been recorded. Tracing without rotation of the head was accompanied by torsional nistagmus. Possible causes of incomplete stabilisation and optokinetic torsional tracing are discussed.

TI  - [Transmission of pronation-supination movements in the wrist].
PY  - 1996
AB  - The wrist plays an essential in role the transmission of pronosupination movements. The four main muscles responsible for these movements are situated above the radiocarpal joint. This anatomic configuration allows a passive movement: Radio Metacarpal Rotation or RMR which is analysed here. Radio Metacarpal Rotation varies according to grip and the couple which is applied distally. An apparatus has been designed to simultaneously measure the angle, the force of grip and the couple. Radio Metacarpal Rotation is firstly measured with the wrist relaxed (grip strength < 5 N) and a distally applied rotation couple of 0.2 N.m in the supination direction and 0.5 N.m in the pronation direction. Secondly, the patient is asked to maintain a grip strength between 80 N and 100 N, and a couple of 1 N.m is applied distally in each direction. One hundred wrists were evaluated. We have looked for the rotation centers of active pronosupination and Radio Metacarpal Rotation. A three dimensional motion analysis device was used (ELITE system). Thirty normal wrists were evaluated. An anatomic study of the radiocarpal ligaments stretched by Radio Metacarpal Rotation was carried out on ten cadaver wrists. When the wrist is relaxed: there is an average Radio Metacarpal Rotation of 42 degrees. This Radio Metacarpal Rotation is reduced when grip is tightened. We have defined a locking test based on these two parameters. This clinical test is represented by two curves on a graph. The active pronosupination center and the radio metacarpal center do not coincide. The center of active pronosupination is situated near the center of the ulnar head and the center of radio-metacarpal rotation is always more lateral. On the anatomical preparations, we found a helicoidal configuration of the radiocarpal ligaments: a ligamentous double helix pronosupination. Radio Metacarpal Rotation interferes with transmission of pronosupination movements. When the wrist is not well locked there is a large lateral sweeping between radius and scaphoid. This sliding at the level of the cartilage can head to development of osteoarthritis of the wrist with a horizontal scaphoid and the good cartilage results after proximal row carpectomy. Radio Metacarpal Rotation must be taken into account when a prothesis designing. We propose a wrist locking test. The results of this test are directly related to the capacity of the joint surfaces to transmit pronosupination movements. Radio Metacarpal Rotation shows the importance of the horizontal plane in the wrist and its essential role in the transmission of pronosupination movements.

PY  - 2002
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of periosteal autograft in repair of ankylosis of elbow joint.METHODS: From May 1985 to November 1999, 18 cases of elbow joints ankylosis (6 cases of osteo-ankylosis, 12 cases of fibroankylosis) were treated by repairing articular surface with periosteal autografting. Out of 18 cases, 13 were caused by old dislocation and fracture of elbow joints, 3 by late rheumatoid arthritis, and 2 by old total joint tuberculosis. In this surgical approach, periosteum from upper end of tibia was transplanted into articular surface after correction of the elbow joint from ankylosis deformity, and continuous passive or active movement of the operated joint was adopted with skeletal traction through olecranon of ulna for 4 weeks after operation. All of the cases were followed up for 1-9 years, 5.2 years on average, before clinical evaluation.RESULTS: The elbow joints in 11 cases were restored to normal, the joints in 4 cases obtained active movement in the range of 100 degrees-0 degree, and the joints in the other 3 cases could only have limited movement because of severe muscular atrophy.CONCLUSION: The articular surface in arthroplasty of elbow joint ankylosis could be effectively repaired by periosteal autograft, and the function of the joints could be obviously improved by continuous movement of the joints after operation with skeletal traction.

TI  - [Treatment of juvenile bone cysts by curettage and filling of the cavity with BAS-0 bioactive glass-ceramic material].
PY  - 2004
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term results of using the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 for bone tissue replacement after removal of juvenile bone cysts by curettage.MATERIAL: Between 1990 and 2000, BAS-0 material was used to fill the cavity after removal of a juvenile bone cyst in 21 patients, 15 males and 6 females, with an average age of 15 years (range 4 to 44 years). Surgical treatment was indicated only in juvenile bone cysts meeting the following criteria: 1) subjective complaints, i. e., pain at activity; 2) X-ray findings of either a) thinning cortical layer with a potential for pathological fracture, particularly in the proximal femur, b) recurrent pathological fractures without apparent healing of the cyst or c) increase in cyst size by 25% within 6 months. In all patients, the diagnosis of a juvenile bone cyst was confirmed by histological examination. Cyst localization was as follows: eight in the humerus, eight in the femur, two in the fibula and one in the ulna, iliac bone and tibia each.METHODS: After careful curettage of a soft tissue lining from the inner surface of the cystic cavity, the space was filled completely with 2- to 4-mm BAS-0 granules in 15 patients; in the rest granules were applied in a mixture with cancellous bone graft, which was either autologous or allogenic. The former was implanted in one patient, the latter, taken from either the mother or father, was used in four and one patients, respectively. All patients were clinically and radiologically examined during the follow-up period of 3 to 12 years, with an average of 7 years. The clinical evaluation was based on subjective complaints, and on the state of soft tissues in the region of lesion, range of motion in the adjacent joints and the loading capacity of the limb treated. Radiological evaluation was based on standard X-ray images assessed according to the classification system of Neer.RESULTS: The clinical examination showed that 10 patients were free from subjective complaints, one patient had rest pain, three patients experienced pain when using the limb, four patients reported mild and intermittent pain, two patients were in pain when the whether changed and one patient complained of pain during pregnancy. Objectively, no inflammatory changes of soft tissues were found. Both passive and active motion of the adjacent joints was possible in the full range and the treated limb retained its complete function in all patients. X-ray examination showed excellent results, i. e., no residuum or cysts recurrence, in 16 patients. A residual lesion was present in one patient and cyst recurrence was recorded in four patients.DISCUSSION: The currently used methods of treatment include corticoid instillation in the cyst, injection of autologous bone marrow, multiple drilling and drainage of the cyst and removal of the cyst with subsequent filling of the cavity with bone graft. In our patients, the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 was used to replace either autogenous or allogenic bone grafts. Complete healing of the cyst was achieved in 76% of our patients, which is the result comparable with the literature data.CONCLUSIONS: Although the therapy of juvenile bone cysts has changed from extensive surgical procedures to less invasive techniques, the curettage of a cyst with subsequent filling of the residual cavity still remains the method of choice in selected patients. Instead of autogenous cancellous bone grafts or allogenic grafts predominantly used for this procedure, the bioactive, glass-ceramic material BAS-0 can be recommended, particularly when the cavity to be filled is located in the metaphysis of a long bone, i. e., in the region subject to great compression.

In 150 healthy volunteers we documented normative data. These results were compared with the data recorded in 34 patients with multidirectional shoulder instabilities. With the arm adducted or in 90 degrees flexion we found no statistically significant differences between volunteers and patients or between the sexes, or between the dominant and the non-dominant extremity in the relationship between the humeral head and the dorsal brim of the glenoid. In 90 degrees abduction and neutral rotation of the arm the dorsal overhang of the humeral head in relation to the dorsal brim of the glenoid was 1.5 mm (+/- 3.5 mm) on the dominant and 1.9 mm (+/- 3.4 mm) on the non-dominant side in the volunteer group. However, in patients with multidirectional shoulder instability the humeral head demonstrated such a high degree of a.-p. translation that we found a ventral overhang of 2.9 mm (+/- 3.7 mm) on the dominant and 0.7 mm (+/- 4.6 mm) on the opposite side. These differences to the volunteer group were statistically highly significant (P less than 0.001). In patients the difference between the dominant and the non-dominant extremity was also significant (P less than 0.05). After active movement into the 90 degree abducted and external rotated position of the arm the differences between volunteers and patients increased, until finally the differences in patients between the dominant and the non-dominant side were highly significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Use of the Dynastab-K (knee) external fixator technique for functional treatment of intra- and peri-articular fractures of the knee joint].
PY  - 2000
AB  - The aim of this study was to validate the results of treatment of articular fractures using a Dynastab-K (knee) external fixator, which gives a good stabilisation, while retaining motion in the knee joint. A group of 6 patients with articular fractures of the knee joint was evaluated. Two fractures were located within the distal femur and 4 within the tibial plateau. After anatomical reposition of the bone fragments primary stabilisation was achieved by means of the Dynastab-K fixator and maintained for a period of 8-10 weeks. Passive motion of the knee was implemented in the first post-op day and active motion was implemented in the third post-op day. In all cases proper healing of the fractures, full extension and a minimally limited flexion (100 degrees) were achieved. Flexion limitation was corrected by means of an intensive rehabilitation programme. Use of the presented technique allows proper stabilisation of the bone fragments with maintenance of joint motion throughout treatment. Basing on our observations we concluded that implementation of an articulated external fixator in articular fractures of the knee leads to proper fracture healing with minimal loss of motion, which can be resolved by rehabilitation procedures.

TI  - [Vascular disorders in irritable hip disclosed by dynamic scintigraphy with radioactive colloids].
PY  - 1982
AB  - The aim of this survey was to determine the vascular disturbances occurring during transient synovitis (observation hip, "hanche irritable"). Within these last two years thirty children were admitted with painful hip, limp and restriction of the passive motion in the hip joint. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease was excluded by roentgenographic analysis and bone scintigraphy. Osteoblastosis was studied by using 99mTc methyl-diphosphonate. Another tracer was necessary to investigate the blood supply into the affected femoral head : 99mTc marked colloids were injected. Immediately after the intravenous administration of the isotope comparative activity was recorded every ten seconds. Computerized information allowed the description of four different stages, i.e. arterial supply, filling peak, venous elimination and later recirculation. Nineteen (63%) affected children presented a decrease in isotopic activity during the first two stages. The proposed interpretation consists in a selective decrease in blood supply in the femoral head. Venous circulation was rarely disturbed. Treatment consisted in bedrest with skin traction. In this series, no aspiration of the joint was performed. Eight days after admission dynamic scintigraphy with marked colloids revealed a highly significant decreased asymmetry between the two femoral heads. Only seven patients (23%) presented arterial hypoperfusion. Fifteen days later only three cases remained abnormal. Two of them presented some weeks after the regression of the symptoms an asymmetrical bone scintigraphy and secondarily the roentgenographic features of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Radioactive colloids seem to be useful to diagnose transient synovitis and to determine the prognosis. Although its etiology is still unknown, transient synovitis seems to be characterized by vascular disturbances consisting in a decrease in blood supply in the affected femoral head. Persistence or recurrence of abnormal colloid scintigraphy is indicative of a poor prognosis.

AB  - 1. Monkeys were trained to trace sinusoids with their index fingers on a planar surface. During this task, both the direction and speed of movement varied continuously. Activity of individual units in the precentral gyrus contralateral to the moving arm was recorded as the task was performed. These cells responded to passive movement of the shoulder and/or elbow. The relation between discharge rate and movement direction for these individual cells could be described with a cosine tuning function. 2. Data recorded as the sinusoid was traced were divided into 100 bins as each cell was studied during the experiment. In each bin, the activity of a particular cell was represented by a vector. The vector ("cell vector") pointed in the direction of finger movement that corresponded to the highest rate of neuronal discharge. This direction, referred to as the preferred direction, corresponded to the peak of the cosine tuning function. The direction of the vector was constant between bins, but the magnitude of this cell's vector was a function of the instantaneous discharge rate. 3. This cell vector is a hypothetical contribution of a single cell to the population response comprised of 554 similarly derived vectors from different cells. The population response was represented as the vector that resulted from forming the sum of the vector contributions from the individual cells. A separate calculation was made for each bin, resulting in 100 population vectors for each sinusoid. 4. Within a given time series of population vectors, their lengths and directions varied in a consistent relation to the tangential velocity of the drawing movement.

TI  - a Note on the Actions of the Cruciate
PY  - 1932
AB  - ACTIVE and passive rotation of the knee joint are now well understood, both as regards causation and limitation. On the other hand, the final rotation at full extension associated with locking, a small movement of only about five degrees, has never been satisfactorily explained, though several authors, whose work has been admirably summarized by Fick (1911), have studied the problem with great care. In the present note some aspects of ordinary rotation are considered as a preliminary to the study of locking (though most of the points mentioned are already well known), and then an attempt is made to find the mechanical cause of the final rotation. A knee joint with all connexions between the femur and the neighbouring bones cut except the collateral and cruciate ligaments behaves as an intact joint, and shows normal locking movements; presence or absence of the semilunar cartilages makes little difference. The range of movement corresponds closely to that of passive move-ments in the living subject, studied by Ross (1932) and others, though voluntary movements of rotation are often more limited. Doubtless in life the ligaments are protected from undue strain by muscular reflexes, but all authors are agreed on the importance of the ligaments in determining the range of the movements. The position of the femur relative to the tibia at any particular degree of flexion is decided partly by the intercondylar eminence of the tibia which articulates with the intercondylar fossa of the femur so that no lateral displacements are allowed, and partly by the cruciate ligaments. These are arranged so that in all positions of the joint forward movement of the femur on the tibia is prevented by the posterior cruciate and backward movement by the anterior cruciate. In the flexed knee, however, the ligaments are relatively slack, so that some small degree of antero-posterior movement of the tibia is possible as a passive movement, both in the living subject and in the cadaver. Now, since their actions are reciprocal, the tensions in the two ligaments will be about equal (Fig. 1 B). For, should the tension in one liga-ment be great, say in the anterior ligament, the femur will be pulled forwards on the tibia until the tension in the posterior ligament is increased so that it exerts a back-ward pull sufficient to balance the forward pull of the anterior ligament. This tendency to equality may be modified by variations in the obliquity of the attachments of the two ligaments with different positions of the joint (Fig. 1 A, C), and by muscular and gravitational forces, but apart from these if one ligament is taut the other must also

TI  - a Study on visual Art and Copyright through an Examination of a Case about Copyright Violation by derivative Work
PY  - 2016
AB  - Even though copyright coincides with creation of artwork, which certainly should be protected, violation and imitation without permission take place frequently with low awareness level about artists' own rights and others' legal rights. Unlike intellectual property rights, copyright does not require registration process and copyright generates at the time of creation, and thus, copyright can be powerful right for artists. Visual art field shows relatively passive movement than adjacent fields such as music or publication, which can be identified with few number of traceable precedent. For this reason, this study analyzed a case about copyright violation by derivative work, which is the most frequent violation of copyright in visual art area, based on examination about artists' extent of a copyright that can be exercised about their artwork. Furthermore, this study displayed the way to exercise of copyright, specific respects of certificate of contents and contract settlement, the means of relieving infringement. In detail, this study analyzes whether an infringer without permission from the owner of copyright has right of secondary copyright or not, and the legal relation between infringer and owner of orinal copyright. It is hoped that artists concretely recognize the copyright on their artworks and the awareness about art copyright in art market is developed through active exercising right in case of infringement of copyright.

TI  - determine the number of toe-walking steps from normal steps in Idiopathic Toe-Walking Children
PY  - 2005
AB  - Idiopathic toe-walking (ITW) is a relatively common condition worldwide\nin children. ITW children are diagnosed by excluding all known causes\nof toe-walking, including neuromuscular or orthopaedic disorders\nand physical injuries. As a consequence of toe-walking, ITW children\ntend to develop shortened calf muscles which may lead to a number\nof problems such as improper balance of the body caused by a slightly\nshifted centre of gravity. Currently, the severity of toe-walking\nin ITW children is evaluated from the measurement of the ankle range\nof passive movement (ROM) and parent's observations. However, long\nterm monitoring of treatment for ITW children is missing. Accelerometers\nhave proved to be efficient and reliable compared to other devices\nand techniques, for analyzing the gait pattern and detection of the\nstance phase and can be small and unobtrusive. Gait monitoring boots\nfitted with dual axis accelerometer in the heel have been developed,\nwhich would serve as long term gait monitoring device for ITW children.\nThe aim of this paper is to detect the stance phase from the acceleration\nsignals obtained from the dual axis accelerometer for a normal gait\nand a toe-walking gait and then determine the percentage of toe-walking\nsteps in the gait of ITW children. &copy; 2005 IEEE.

TI  - fMRI assessment of upper extremity related brain activation with an MRI-compatible manipulandum
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose Longitudinal studies to evaluate the effect of rehabilitative therapies require an objective, reproducible and quantitative means for testing function in vivo. An fMRI assessment tool for upper extremity related brain activation using an MRI-compatible manipulandum was developed and tested for use in neurorehabilitation research.Methods Fifteen healthy, right-handed subjects participated in two fMRI sessions, which were three to four weeks apart. A block design paradigm, composed of three conditions of subject-passive movement, subject-active movement and rest, was employed for the fMRI recordings. During the rest condition, subjects simply held the device handle without applying any force or movement. The same type of auditory and visual instructions were given in all the three conditions, guiding the subjects to perform the motor tasks interactively with the MRI-compatible arm manipulandum. The tasks were controlled across the fMRI sessions. The subjects' brain activation was recorded by fMRI, and their behavioral performance was recorded by the manipulandum. The brain network activated by the subjects' interaction with the manipulandum was identified, and the reproducibility and reliability of the obtained activation were determined.Results All subjects completed the trial protocol. Two subjects were excluded from analysis due to head motion artifacts. All passive movements were performed well. Four out of the total 780 active movements were missed by two subjects. Brain activation was found in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and non-primary motor cortex as well as in subcortical areas in the thalamus, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. These activations were consistent across the two fMRI sessions.Conclusion The MRI-compatible manipulandum elicited robust and reproducible brain activations in healthy subjects during the subject-active and subject-passive upper extremity motor tasks with a block design paradigm. This system is promising for many applications in neurorehabilitation research and may be useful for longitudinal studies.

TI  - fMRI responses of the brain during active and passive movements in left-handed subjects
PY  - 2017
AB  - The hemodynamic (magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, 3T) brain responses were studied in 15 left-handed healthy subjects performing active and passive movements of the dominant and non-dominant hands. Group and individual fMRI responses to the motor load were analyzed. It was found that, during the active movements of dominant and non-dominant hands, the main activation cluster appeared in the preand postcentral gyrus of the contralateral hemisphere and which topographically similar during active and passive movements. The activation cluster of greater volume was identified in these areas; the response was more diffused during the non-dominant hand movements in comparison with the dominant hand. During passive movements, the cortical activation clusters of a smaller volume in comparison with the active movements were found, which was expressed most clearly during the performance of non-dominant hand movements and could reflect the weakening of the control from the cortical structures in these conditions. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

TI  - negation in the brain
PY  - 2007
AB  - Sentential negation is a universal syntactic feature of human languages that reverses the truth value expressed by a sentence. An intriguing question concerns what brain mechanisms underlie our ability to represent and understand the meaning of negative sentences. We approach this issue by investigating action-related language processing and the associated neural representations. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we measured brain activity in 18 healthy subjects during passive listening of sentences characterized by a factorial combination of polarity (affirmative vs. negative) and concreteness (action- related vs. abstract). Negation deactivated cortical areas and the left pallidum. Compared to abstract sentences, action-related sentences activated the left-hemispheric action-representation system. Crucially, the polarity by concreteness interactions showed that the activity within the action-representation system was specifically reduced for negative action-related vs. affirmative action-related sentences (compared to abstract sentences). Accordingly, functional integration within this system as measured by Dynamic Causal Modeling was specifically weaker for negative action-related than for affirmative action-related sentences. This modulation of action representations indicates that sentential negation transiently reduces the access to mental representations of the negated information.

TI  - Über das Wesen der optomotorischen Reaktionen
PY  - 1953
AB  - Flying and swimming animals need to be able to avoid passive displacement by air and water currents. Optomotor reactions essentially serve this purpose. The animals must be able to distinguish precisely between sensory stimulation caused by passive displacement and by active locomotion. Stimulation due to active movements does not release optomotor reactions. Apparent exceptions to this rule, occurring only under artificial circumstances, are caused by a derangement of either normal sensory stimulation or normal movement and, consequently, of their normal correlation. Examples of both cases are discussed. © 1953 Birkhäuser Verlag.

In two of the three cases mentioned (Carcinus, Calandra) the evidence brought forward is insufficient and needs further experimental investigation. In the third case (Aeschna) their conclusion is obviously erroneous: the sensory stimuli eliciting optomotor reactions are caused by the passive displacement (turning) inflicted upon the animal artificially and not by its active movement as such. © 1953 Birkhäuser Verlag.

PY  - 1936
AB  - Two independently functioning mechanisms enable the "phantom" larva and the pupa of this culicid dipteran to remain poised at a given depth in the water. The first is a static function performed by the air sacs, effecting an adjustment to water pressure in dependence upon body weight. The second is a dynamic function, through rhythmic contractile movements of the appendages (i.e. "springing" in the larva, "somersaults" in the pupa). These movements differ according to the intensity of stimulation on sense hairs through current changes and through the insect's own movements. Water pressure indirectly causes active movements, by effecting passive shifts in position and thereby effecting stimulation of cutaneous receptors.

AB  - Disaster-prone area is declared to were already affected or may be affected by the disasters that have been occurred or are likely to occur in the disaster survey reports. In addition, these areas should be areas that cannot be rehabilitation for technically or economically reasons by means of improvement studies. However, the future impact of the landslide on the settlements located at the boundary of the area determined according to this definition is sometimes not evaluated. Istanbul Avcılar Ambarlı Landslide Area was declared a disaster-prone area in 2005. In the area, 56 buildings became unusable and all the buildings in the area were demolished due to resolution. However, during the ongoing process, any monitoring studies had not been working in the area. The landslide situation was left uncontrolled within this period, and risks to which the near structures might be affected were not evaluated. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the potential of growth of The Landslide Area and the current security conditions in the near structures. Previous studies in the field were evaluated and new soil exploration drillings and index and mechanical laboratory experiments were performed within the scope of the study. Inclinometer measurements were made for 6 months, sliding planes were determined and moving velocities were calculated for the landslide that were determined to continue active movement. For the current situation, despite the risks determined by static and dynamic stability analyzes, taking into account the structural loads in the impact area, the cantilever type shoring system was modeled, and the safety conditions for the north of the area were defined.

TI  - Концепт судьбы в картине мира англосаксов VII–XI веков
PY  - 2016
AB  - The article is devoted to the notions of fate in early medieval picture of the world on the material of Anglo-Saxon epic monuments. The novelty and relevance of the study is due to the lack of special works dealing with the problem in domestic medievalism. Based on the analysis of authentic old English texts it is shown that in VII—XI centuries the Anglo-Saxon views on fate were very complex and combined elements of the barbaric and the Christian worldview. In particular, attention is paid to the problem of the correlation between the images of “God” and “fate” in the written culture of the Anglo-Saxons, the problem of optimism and pessimism in understanding the life of a person, the problem of “active” and “passive” perception of destiny. It is proved that Anglo-Saxons’ awareness of distinction of human lives was combined with a belief in the justice of the Creator. In the first centuries after the adoption of Christianity by the Anglo-Saxons the fate was not seen as the doom that was impossible to resist, and the man in its attitude took quite an active position. Only with the further dissemination of Christian culture the “active” perception of destiny was replaced by the “passive”. The image of the fate is replaced by image of the share, which depends entirely on God’s Providence and with which the person has left to live with. Cтатья посвящена представлениям о судьбе в раннесредневековой картине мира на материале англосаксонских эпических памятников. Новизна и актуальность исследования обусловлены отсутствием в отечественной медиевистике специальных работ, посвященных данной проблеме. На основе анализа аутентичных древнеанглийских текстов показано, что в VII—XI веках представления англосаксов о судьбе отличались большой сложностью и соединяли элементы варварского и христианского мировоззрения. В частности, уделяется внимание проблеме соотношения образов «Бога» и «судьбы» в письменной культуре англосаксов, проблеме оптимиз- ма и пессимизма в осмыслении жизненного пути человека, проблеме «активного» и «пассивного» восприятия судьбы. Доказано, что осознание англосаксами различий человеческих судеб сочеталось с верой в справедливость Создателя. В первые столетия после принятия англосаксами христианства судьба не рассматривалась как рок, которому невозможно противостоять, и человек в ее отношении занимал вполне активную позицию. Лишь с дальнейшим распространением христианской культуры «активное» восприятие судьбы вытесняется «пассивным». Образ судьбы замещается образом доли, которая всецело зависит от Божьего Промысла и с которой человеку остается смириться.

AB  - The article describes the Russian Language Development Assessment, a standardized individual diagnostic tool for children aged from 3 to 9 that helps to assess the following components of a child's communicative function: passive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, knowledge of semantic constructs with logical, temporal and spatial relations, passive perception and active use of syntactic and morphological features of words in a sentence, active and passive phonological awareness, active and passive knowledge of syntactic structures and categories. The article provides descriptions of content and diagnostic procedures for all 7 subtests included in the assessment (Passive Vocabulary, Active Vocabulary, Linguistic Operators, Sentence structure, Word Structure, Phonology, Sentence Repetition). Basing on the data collected in the study that involved 86 firstgraders of a Moscow school, the article analyzes the internal consistency and construct validity of each subtest of the technique. It concludes that the Russian Language Development Assessment technique can be of much use both in terms of diagnostic purposes and in supporting children with ASD taking into account the lack of standardized tools for language and speech development assessment in Russian and the importance of this measure in general.

TI  - ‘Abduction brace versus sling after arthroscopic cuff repair‘
PY  - 2012
AB  - INTERVENTION: We will study the effect on pain in patients undergoing arthroscopic cuff repair comparing an abduction brace with a sling. Group 1: Sling The slings hold the elbow at 90 degrees, and restricts exorotation. Group 2: Abduction brace The brace holds the arm in 45 degrees of abduction and in neutral rotation. Before surgery, the patient is randomized into one of the two groups, by the researcher. The allocated group will be noted in the patient file and the orthopaedic surgeon will be informed. Surgery will be performed with the patient in the beach‐chair position and under general anesthesia and a interscalene block. The surgery will be fully arthroscopic, and a double row suture bride technique will be used. When the surgery is finished, before transferring the patient the brace of sling will be put on. Directly after surgery, pain scores are determined at the PACU and ward. The patient is asked to keep a diary of the pain score at home on daily or weekly base in a diary. The rehabilitation program for both groups is equal and will be communicated to their own physiotherapist by letter. The first 6 weeks they have to wear the sling or brace day and night and are advised to perform circumduction exercises at home. The physiotherapist will perform passive motions exercises to maximum 70 degrees of elevation and 20 degrees of exorotation. No active motion is allowed for six weeks or until complete recovery of passive motion had occurred. After six weeks, active motions exercises guided by the physiotherapist are allowed. CONDITION: Cuff lesion ; ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: The main parameter of this study will be the difference in pain between the patients receiving an abduction brace and patients receiving a sling. This will be measured once preoperatively, eight times in the first 48 hours postoperatively, twice a day in the remaining first week and then weekly up to three months. The participants will fill in the VAS score on a 10 cm wide horizontal scale. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Secondary parameters are the Constant, ASES (only ROM part), WORC and EQ‐5D score. Intra‐operatively the orthopaedic surgeon will classify the size of the cuff tear according to the classification systems described by Thomazeau (stage 1‐5) and by Boileau (A‐F). INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Cuff repair (primary procedure) for confirmed cuff lesion; 2. Subacromial decompression (optional secondary procedure); 3. Sufficient understanding of the Dutch language; 4. Competent adults; 5. Willing and able to comply to the study protocol.

TI  - ‘Zigzag motion’ goes in unexpected directions
PY  - 2009
AB  - In a novel ‘zigzag motion’ display, random dots made alternate long and short jumps, 10 mm downward and 1 mm to the right. The zigs and zags were either at right angles (differing by 90°) or in opposite directions (180°). Result: The perceived direction of motion varied with the viewing distance or spatial scale. During close-up [or distant] viewing the display appeared to move in the direction of the short [or long] jumps. When the motion was stopped after 30 s, a motion aftereffect (MAE) was seen, driven by the short jumps but not the long jumps. Therefore, the perceived direction of motion was dissociated from its aftereffect. A picture rotated alternately 5° clockwise (CW) and 1° counterclockwise (CCW) and appeared to rotate jerkily CW. When stopped, a clockwise MAE was seen, appropriate to the small 1° jumps. If the test field contained blurred, dynamic visual noise, the MAE was now CCW, appropriate to the large 5° jumps; the large jumps drove the perceived motion direction and dynamic MAE, but the small jumps drove the static MAE. Conclusion: Winner-take-all competition between pathways tuned to fast and slow movements. Their independent adaptation gave opposite static and dynamic MAEs.

TI  - “Flipping” The Classroom To Explore Active Learning In A Large Undergraduate Course
PY  - 2009
AB  - In traditional approaches to teaching engineering classes, the instructor plays the role of information conveyor, while the students assume a receiver role with primary responsibilities of listening and note-taking. Research into how students learn suggests that students need to be more actively engaged with the course material to maximize their understanding. The literature contains many examples of active learning strategies, such as teams solving problems in class and the use of student response systems with conceptual questions. Incorporating active learning strategies into a class means that there will be less time for delivering material via lecture. Therefore, instructors who choose to utilize active learning strategies must find ways to ensure that all required course content is still addressed. This paper discusses an instructional technique called the “classroom flip” model which was assessed in a larger, undergraduate architectural engineering class. In this model, lecture content is removed from the classroom to allow time for active learning, and the content that was removed is delivered to students via on-line video. This approach ‘flips’ the traditional use of lecture and more active learning approaches. Lecture occurs outside of class, and more active learning, such as problem solving, happens during class. Assessment data was collected to examine students’ use of the video lectures and perceptions of the classroom flip. The students’ feedback suggests that while the active learning and additional project time available in class improved their understanding, they would prefer that only about half the classes be flipped and some use of traditional lectures should be maintained. Engineering instructors are often encouraged to try instructional techniques that encourage their students to be more actively engaged with course material. Active learning is defined by the engineering education community as the “involvement of students in their own learning.”1 Active learning encompasses a variety of instructional techniques, in which students participate in activities during class time that involve more than passive listening. Active learning techniques include in-class group work, think-pair-share, “clicker” questions using student response systems, and minute papers. Active learning is necessary in order to increase understanding and for enhancing problem solving skills. The National Research Council has stated that “…the new science of learning is beginning to provide knowledge to improve significantly people’s abilities to become active learners who seek to understand complex subject matter and are better prepared to transfer what they have learned to new problems and settings” (p. 13) 2 However, many instructors still utilize class time for lecture and are concerned that active learning consumes valuable time that is needed to cover material. The lecture method is often used as the primary method to make sure

AB  - Investigations were carried out in regard to the relationship between an athlete's identity orientation and career decision making behavior. An athlete's identity orientation was defined operationally as a psychological orientation of self definition through the sports experience・That is ego orientation which is oriented to the internal environment or social orientation which is oriented to the external environment. In study 1, an athlete's identity orientation scale, occupational identity status scale and occupational decision making process scale were established・The occupational decision making process scale is used to examine the type of occupational decision making process during one's college years. Also, Melgosa's occupational identity status scale, based on the work of Marcia, was translated into Japanese and utilized for this study. This scale examines the degrees of achievement, moratorium, forclosure and diffusion which are four types of identity status・In study ２,5６1 male college athletes were rated using these scales. Considering the Z scores of each athlete's identity orientation subscales (ego and social scales), subjects rated to 4 groups (high in both subscales: ES, high in ego scale: Es, high in social scale: eS, low in both subscales es) were selected. Then the occupational identity status and occupational decision process were compared among the 4 groups. The ego scale dominant groups (ES and Es) were high in achievement score, and many subjects in these groups were rated as settlement type with active exploration in career decision making. The subjects in none of marked (es) or not dominant in ego scale groups showed passive and ambiguous career decision making. According to these results, it can be considered that athelete's identity orientation reflects the process of career desicion making. Subjects in ego subscale dominant groups are actively involved in it.

In the system, subjects wear the sensor on back of their hand and the display on their fingers. They feel tactile sensation by moving the hands. We adopt recurrent neural networks (RNNs) evolved by interactive evolutionary computation as relations between the sensor and the display. The subjects evolve the RNNs by using 2 Japanese Onomatopoeias (Uneune and Zarazara) as evolutionary goals, and we do experiments using the evolved RNNs for them. The results indicate that the system has ability to represent several tactile sensations, tactile sensations can not be represent by combinations of sine waves of static amplitude, and the system has application possibility to linguistics by comparison of onomatopoeias.

AB  - The contact force of a finger has been measured using various methods for applications in bio-mechanics and user interface, due to its importance for object manipulation and body motion. However, in most of the previous methods, the motion of the user is restricted in a limited space due to the sensing device structure. This research focused on the changes in blood flow due to deformation of blood vessels caused by mechanical stress on the body. Furthermore, this report proposes a novel method to estimate the contact force of a fingertip using a photoplethysmogram (PPG) measured at the proximal part of the finger. The proposed method detects non-pulsatile and pulsatile components of PPG signals, extracts feature values related to the contact force, and estimates the contact force at the fingertip by multiple regression. In the validation experiments, the participants wore a PPG detector at the proximal part of the index finger and applied a contact force. Then, the relationship between the contact force and PPG feature values was investigated. The estimated error was found to be 15％ of the maximum contact force for passive touch. Furthermore, the experiment indicated that the contact force could be estimated for active touch regardless of the finger angle.

AB  - Experiments on adaptation to distorted visual and tactile rectangles were carried out to investigate interactions between visuo-tactile sensory integration and active perception in shape perception. The interactions have two aspects: the effects of active perception on sensory integration and the effects of sensory integration on active perception. Therefore, the first part of this paper discusses sensory integration with active and passive touch, and the second part discusses the changes of active touch finger movement in the sensory integration process. During the experiments, cross-modal reaction tests were held to evaluate adaptation to the vertical/horizontal ratio of shapes. Amount of sensory integration was estimated by this evaluation. There are two features of sensory integration with active touch: perception with voluntary finger movement and perception with synchronized visual and tactile information. Therefore, comparisons were made first between adaptation experiments with voluntary touch and that with passive touch, and secondly among that with successive visual and tactile stimulation, that with concurrent stimulation, and that with concurrent stimulation with visualized finger movement which strengthened the synchronization. The first comparison showed that adaptation of subjects with voluntary touch was greater than that of those with passive touch. The second comparison showed that adaptation was enhanced by visualized finger movement. Thus, voluntariness and intermodal synchronization of active perception were important factors in sensory integration. In these adaptation experiments, the finger movements by which the subjects actively obtain tactile information of shapes were measured by PSD camera. From position data of the finger, maximum velocities of movement were calculated, and the finger movement system was identified by applying ARMA model. When subjects were exposed to visual and tactile information concurrently either with or without visualized finger movement, maximum velocities of finger movement increased as the experiment proceed. In order to observe changes in finger movement systems, simulations of identified systems were performed. Simulated step responses of finger movement showed that rise time shortened as the experiment proceeded. These results suggested that sensory integration causes a quick response of active touch to visual information. Sensory integration and active perception interact effectively.

AB  - Following primary repair of severed extensor tendons, various methods are used to limit tendon adhesions and avoid rupture. Early passive digital motion with wrist extension (a "reverse Kleinert" protocol) has been advocated. However, there are no data to support an optimum wrist position or how much finger motion may safely be permitted. In this study we used eight fresh cadaver arms to measure extensor tendon gliding in Verdan's Zones 3-8 when active grip and passive extension were simulated at different wrist positions. We found that if the wrist is extended more than 21.4 degree, the extensor tendon glides with little or no tension in Zone 5 and 6 throughout full simulated grip to full passive extension, permitting "passive motion" exercises to minimize tendon adhesions without risking rupture. Additionally, we found that up to 6.4 mm of tendon can be debrided safely if the wrist is splinted at 45 degree extension and full grip is still permitted postoperatively.

Moving object tasks on paper stimulus with several kinds of visual stimuli were done in experiments according to the hypotheses. The results showed that the magnitude of force perception can be modified by audio-visual information and can be explained as an average of tactile force and audio-visual information, suggesting that the contrast effect with a tactile gain control by audio-visual information may occur only in passive haptic events not in active ones.

AB  - Sci. Rep. Hokkaido Fish. Exp. Stn. Life history polymorphism and the population dynamics of wakasagi (Hypomesus nipponensis) in Lake Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan Masaru TORISAWA The life history polymorphism and the population dynamics of wakasagi Hypomesus nipponensis McALLISTER in Lake Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan were examined in this study. The catch-yield of wakasagi in Lake Abashiri always has a superior rank among the places of production of wakasagi in Japan. Lake Abashiri is also important as a base supplying eggs as artificial seeds to various areas of Japan. The catch-yield of wakasagi in Lake Abashiri, however, has been unstable. The mechanism of population dynamics of wakasagi in Lake Abashiri had not been elucidated. Wakasagi H. nipponensis is a diadromous fish and there are wakasagi with different types of life history polymor-phism concerned with diadromous fish in Lake Abashiri. The mechanism of divergence of the life history polymor-phism, however, had not been elucidated either. In this study, the author followed the whole life history of wakasagi in Lake Abashiri and discussed the mechanisms of divergence of life history polymorphism and population dynamics. The peak of spawning season was April to May and the period of ascending into rivers for spawning seemed to be controlled by water temperature. Ascending and descending rivers for spawning occurred during nighttime. Males ascended the rivers before females and took part in spawning for long periods. On the other hand, females finished spawning a short time after ascending rivers and descended soon after spawning. A mating experiment combining males and females with different body sizes revealed that successful mating had nothing to do with combinations of body sizes between males and females. Besides, most fertilized eggs normally hatched out. Consequently, strict reproductive isolation seemed not to occur between fish with different life history polymorphism even if the spawning seasons or the body sizes were different according to the life history polymorphism. Hatching out of wakasagi larvae was concentrated in a brief interval soon after sunset. The hatching periods had a little difference according to years and there were a couple of hatching peaks each year. Wakasagi in their early life stages were partially distributed in the lake and were abundantly distributed near the rivers flowing into the lake in May. However, after May, there was no fixed distribution pattern that was common to every year. Biomass and body sizes in early life stages fluctuated over the years. Daily seaward movement and daily amount of seaward migration were examined in anadromous-form 0+ aged fish using traps in the Abashiri River flowing out from Lake Abashiri. As a result, the movement of the fish was nocturnal and passive to the flow so that their direction and speed were changed according to the ebb and flow of tide, and no active movements to the sea were observed. Seaward migration mainly occurred between July and September every year and the movement was closely connected with the cycle of the tide. The amount of seaward migration, the peak period of seaward migration, and the body length at the peak of seaward migration were quite different each year. Furthermore, the daily sizes of seaward migrating fish in the same year were not constant and gradually became larger day by day. The amount of seaward migration suddenly increases when the density of fish exceeded some value in the lake just before the seaward migration occurred. No universal differences were ob-(Hokkaido Abashiri Fisheries Experimental Station. Masuura, Abashiri, Hokkaido 099-3119, Japan)

PY  - 2012
AB  - The importance of voluntary exercise and sensory input in rehabilitation training after spinal cord injury (SCI) or cerebrovascular disease has been demonstrated by recent studies. However, the voluntary exercise is an impossible task for severe paraplegic and hemiplegic patients who cannot move their lower limbs by themselves. The purpose of this study is to verify whether these patients can perform a new voluntary exercise by using a robot suit which generates walking motion in place of the wearerʼs paralyzed muscles by detecting their voluntary bioelectrical signals. Two severe SCI patients who can barely produce neuromuscular activation but cannot move their lower limb participated in this study. Experimental results demonstrated that the robot suit was able to detect their voluntary neuromuscular activities via bioelectrical signals and provide stepping and walking motion having appropriate temporal relationship with the voluntary activities. In addition, the proposed voluntary exercise using the robot suit can significantly promote neuromuscular activities of the target muscles more than passive exercise.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of rotation and delay of visual feedback on self-body movement recognition. In the present experiment, visual feedback of subject’s hand movement was delayed by hundreds of milliseconds and rotated by 0 - 270◦(at 90◦ intervals). The subject was required to judge the temporal discrepancy between the hand movement and its visual feedback in a forced-choice manner. In one group the subject was instructed to move their own hand at the experimenter’s instruction (active movement), while in another group the subject’s hand was moved by the experimenter (passive movement). The results showed that the delay detection rate was increased as the delay length becomes larger both in active and passive movements. Statistical analyses revealed that rotation of visual feedback has an effect to elongate the delay detection threshold (50% detection rate), and the threshold was significantly longer in the 180◦ rotation condition than in the 0◦ rotation condition. The steepness of delay detection curve was significantly steeper in active than passive movement. However, there was no significant interaction between rotation and movement (active / passive) factors. We suppose independent effects of rotation and delay of visual feedback on self-body recognition.f

AB  - The objective of this study is to develop the variable control mechanism to amplify the operating range of the end-effector of the wearable haptic device. The conventional haptic devices are classified into passive haptic devices and active haptic devices by means of the force display conditions. The passive haptic device has a wide operating range and a high bandwidth of the dynamic characteristics in the force non-displayed condition. On the other hand, the active haptic device provides accurate resistive force for the operator by changing the posture of the device by the active actuators. In this study, the variable control mechanism which has both of these advantages is developed. The proposed mechanism is able to control the mechanical connection between the active actuator and the end effector of the haptic device. In addition, the force detection mechanism and the angle detection mechanism of the wrist for the force feedback control are developed to display an accurate force. The experiments of the transition between the unconstraint condition and the constraint condition of the end effector were carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the variable control mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed haptic device with the proposed mechanism is able to improve the dynamic characteristics of the end-effector and to amplify the operating range of the end-effector of the wearable haptic device.

The result of analysis as follows; all unit spaces in museum assorted into three groups; a singular space, mixture space and passing space. 1) In a singular space, arranging exhibits which are encouraging static movement to visitors bring high value of holding power. 2) In a mixture space, reducing the number of adjacent spaces and arranging exhibits which are encouraging dynamic movement lead to the visual concentration of visitors. 3) In a passing space, arranging exhibits that can be appreciated as passing by is recommended. It should be taking care of not to disturb the visitor circulation as well.

AB  - [호흡은 춤 동작에 생명력을 불어 넣어 주는 원천적인 요소로서 충의 내적, 외적 흐름을 결정지어 주는 가장 중요한 요인이 된다. 또한 이 호흡과 충의 동작은 서로 떼어 놓고 생각 할 수 없을 만큼 불가분의 관계를 지닌다. 그러므로 본 연구에서는 한성준(韓成俊) 류 (類) 태평무(太平舞) 터벌림 과장 춤사위의 호흡구조 분석을 통하여 그 유형과 그에 따른 특성을 추출하여 알아봄으로써 이 춤을 보다 과학적이고도 객관적으로 분석, 그 실체를 파악해 보고자 하였다. 그 결과 다음과 같은 결론에 도달했다.  첫째, 태평무 터벌림 과장의 호흡구조를 들숨, 날숨, 멈춤의 호흡표기법에 의해 분석해 본 결과, 10박 1호흡(회)과 10박 2호흡(회), 그리고 10박 3호흡(회)과 10박 4호 흡(회)으로 구성되어 있음을 알 수 있었다.  둘째, 터벌림 과장에서 들숨 • 날숨 • 멈춤이 차지하고 있는 비율을 살펴보았을 때, 들 숨 75회와 날숨 81회, 그리고 멈춤 12회로 들숨보다 날숨이 다소 많은 것으로 나타났다. 여기에서 들숨과 날숨의 다양한 변화는 터벌림 춤사위의 기교적인 측면이 부각되었다고 볼 때 이는 멈춤 호흡의 정적인 멋과 더불어 그 역동성이 강조되는 춤을 이루는 원천이 되었다고 할 수 있다.  셋째, 터벌림의 호흡유형을 추출하여 분석해본 결과 큰호홉과 중간호홉 그리고 작은호 홉이 다양하게 구성되어 있다. 그러나 그 호흡의 기교에 따라 들숨과 날숨이 대칭을 이루는 호흡선 뿐만 아니라 멈춤을 나타내는 수직선 부호로 인하여 비대칭형의 변형된 호흡선의 두 가지 양상으로 나타났다.  넷째, 터벌림 춤사위의 호흡유형과 연관하여 특성을 분석해 정리해 본다면, 길고 깊은 호흡으로 시작하여 점진적으로 빨라지면서 짧고 얕은 호흡으로 맺음과 어름 그리고 풀음 기법에 의한 점一선一원의 호흡선으로 이어져 필체 • 학체 • 궁체의 춤사위가 되었다. 특히, 이때의 춤에서는 학체와 궁체의 춤사위가 주를 이루어 매우 부드러우면서 기교적이고 역동적인 춤사위를 드러냈다., As the original element of providing vitality to dancing motion, breathing becomes the most important factor of determining the internal and external flows of dancing. Also, it has an inseparable relation with the motion. Thus, this study tried to analyze the breathing structure of a Han, Sungjun style of Taepyeongmu (Peace Dance) motion, extract breathing patterns and features from the analysis and explore them, analyze the dance more scientifically and objectively and understand its substance. If 1 say the result here first, it can be summarized as follows.  First, analyzing the breathing structure of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim by the breathing notation of inhalation, exhalation and stop showed that Episode Tubullim one breath(twice), two breaths(four times), three breaths(eight times) and four breaths(nine times) of tenfold time.  Secondly, exploring the percentages accounted for by Episode Tubullim Quantifying them in detail showed that inhalation appeared 75 tines, exhalation 81 times and stop 12 times. In particular, the various changes of inhalation and exhalation here revealing the technical aspects of Taepyeongmu dance motion highlighted indicated that they became the origin for the dance whose dynamicity is emphasized together with the static taste of stop breathing.  Thirdly, extracting and analyzing the breathing pattern of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim showed that most of Episode Tubullim consisted variously of big, middle and small breaths. But not only a breath line of symmetrical inhalation and exhalation according to the techniques of the breaths but also a vertical sign expressive of stop caused two aspects of asymmetrical transformed breath lines.  Fourthly, analyzing and arranging the episode-specific feature of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim in connection with the breathing pattern of its motion showed that Episode Tubullim had bow-shaped, crane-shaped, and brush-shaped dancing motions from long and deep breaths through short and shallow breaths with progressive speed to breath lines of dot, line and circle by the techniques of fastening, tightrope dancing and unfastening.  In particular, crane-shaped and bow-shaped dancing motions which were very soft, technical and dynamic formed the mainstream of the dance at that time. Also, they showed Korean static, middle and dynamic feature with outstanding internal breathing technique by adding stop breathing between]
