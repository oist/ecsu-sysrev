"Split-Belt walking induces changes in active, but not passive, perception of step length",4,"Successful motor control requires accurate estimation of our body in space for planning, executing, and evaluating the outcome of our actions. It has been shown that the estimation of limb position is susceptible to motor adaptation. However, a similar effect has not been found in locomotion, possibly due to how it was tested. We hypothesized that split-belt walking with the legs moving at different speeds changes the estimation of the legs’ position when taking a step. Thus, we assessed young subjects’ perception of step length (i.e., inter-feet distance at foot landing) when they moved their legs (active perception) or when the legs were moved by the experimenter (passive perception). We found that the active perception of step length was substantially altered following split-belt walking, whereas passive perception exhibited minor changes. This suggests that split-belt walking induced the adaptation of efferent signals, without altering sensory signals. We also found that active perceptual shifts were sensitive to how they were tested: they were most salient in the trailing leg and at short step lengths. Our results suggest that split-belt walking could modulate the deficient perception of step length post-stroke, which may contribute to gait asymmetries impairing patients’ mobility.",01.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4cb02b940fe7b893b478a727f063aa16/77e4dbef/01.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,"""we assessed young subjects’ perception of step length (i.e., inter-feet distance at foot landing) when they moved their legs (active perception) or when the legs were moved by the experimenter (passive perception).""",,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52860-9
Haptic discrimination of distance,8,"While quite some research has focussed on the accuracy of haptic perception of distance, information on the precision of haptic perception of distance is still scarce, particularly regarding distances perceived by making arm movements. In this study, eight conditions were measured to answer four main questions, which are: what is the influence of reference distance, movement axis, perceptual mode (active or passive) and stimulus type on the precision of this kind of distance perception? A discrimination experiment was performed with twelve participants. The participants were presented with two distances, using either a haptic device or a real stimulus. Participants compared the distances by moving their hand from a start to an end position. They were then asked to judge which of the distances was the longer, from which the discrimination threshold was determined for each participant and condition. The precision was influenced by reference distance. No effect of movement axis was found. The precision was higher for active than for passive movements and it was a bit lower for real stimuli than for rendered stimuli, but it was not affected by adding cutaneous information. Overall, the Weber fraction for the active perception of a distance of 25 or 35 cm was about 11% for all cardinal axes. The recorded position data suggest that participants, in order to be able to judge which distance was the longer, tried to produce similar speed profiles in both movements. This knowledge could be useful in the design of haptic devices. © 2014 van Beek et al.",05.PDF (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d205f2c6544f5e8110fbefceed510461/43a6fc8a/05.PDF),checked,checked,checked,,"""eight conditions were measured to answer four main questions, which are: what is the influence of reference distance, movement axis, perceptual mode (active or passive) and stimulus type on the precision of this kind of distance perception?

"""Active"" and ""passive"" learning of three-dimensional object structure within an immersive virtual reality environment",10,"We used a fully immersive virtual reality environment to study whether actively interacting with objects would effect subsequent recognition, when compared with passively observing the same objects. We found that when participants learned object structure by actively rotating the objects, the objects were recognized faster during a subsequent recognition task than when object structure was learned through passive observation. We also found that participants focused their study time during active exploration on a limited number of object views, while ignoring other views. Overall, our results suggest that allowing active exploration of an object during initial learning can facilitate recognition of that object, perhaps owing to the control that the participant has over the object views upon which they can focus. The virtual reality environment is ideal for studying such processes, allowing realistic interaction with objects while maintaining experimenter control.",06.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c7ec975a95ba9ab3c9ee8abffdf33763/09245d59/06.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195466
An instance of tactile suppression: Active exploration impairs tactile sensitivity for the direction of lateral movement,11,"The phenomenon of a reduction in tactile sensitivity during voluntarily executed body movement we call ?tactile suppression?. This is in analogy to saccadic suppression where the visual sensitivity is reduced during voluntarily executed eye movements 1. Here we investigate tactile suppression using an integrated tactile/kinesthetic display consisting of a tactile shear force device 2 mounted on a hyper redundant haptic display (ViSHaRD10 3). To quantify the tactile suppression effect we measured subject?s motion-direction discrimination performance for tactile stimuli moving laterally on the index finger under various active and passive exploration conditions. In the baseline condition (?static?) only tactile stimuli were provided using the shear-force device while the arm was held still. In the ?active? condition subjects had to discriminate the direction of tactile motion while actively executing arm movements at the same time. Finally, in the ?passive? condition the kinesthetic device pas sively moved the subjects? arm, while the subject was performing the discrimination task. Compared to the ?still? condition results indicate a significant decrease of tactile sensibility during active movements whereas passive movements seem to have a minor effect on tactile discrimination performance.",07.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b6d8b89d54433a38eb60f8333abf1da2/e8309d55/07.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,"3 conditions: active, passive and static",https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1790891_3/component/file_3158556/content

Active versus passive touch in three dimensions,20,"Active subjects freely explored virtual three-dimensional geometric shapes using a phantom force-feedback device.

In experiment 1 the active subject's movements were recorded and ""played back"" to the passive counterpart at a later time - a delayed yoking.

Active touch does not improve sequential processing in a counting task,21,"Active touch involves tactile and proprioceptive sensory inputs, activation of the motor system and executive functions. It has been shown by the previous literature that active touch facilitates shape recognition. Since both active and passive exploration requires sequential presentation of the tactile inputs, this facilitation may be due to the improvement of the sequential-processing mechanism. The effects of active and passive touch on the sequential processing of tactile inputs were tested at different stimulus-presentation rates in a counting task. Active touch did not improve the performance, which shows that the additional sensory and motor information conveyed by active exploration are not utilized by the sequential-processing mechanism. Therefore, the results cannot be explained by the feature-specific theory of sequential processing. On the other hand, the counting errors were higher than those predicted by the limitation of the minimal inter-stimulus interval, which is suggested by the central-timing theory. Consequently, it is proposed that a mechanism based on the central-timing theory may contribute to tactile sequential processing, but the bottleneck at high presentation rates is probably due to short-term memory.",13.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/076ad82e8c0b75528d51672bf0d23688/f2b40964/13.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17691224
Dynamic cutaneous information is sufficient for precise curvature discrimination,24,"Our tactual perceptual experiences occur when we interact, actively and passively, with environmental objects and surfaces. Previous research has demonstrated that active manual exploration often enhances the tactual perception of object shape. Nevertheless, the factors that contribute to this enhancement are not well understood. The present study evaluated the ability of 28 younger (mean age was 23.1 years) and older adults (mean age was 71.4 years) to discriminate curved surfaces by actively feeling objects with a single index finger and by passively feeling objects that moved relative to a restrained finger. While dynamic cutaneous stimulation was therefore present in both conditions, active exploratory movements only occurred in one. The results indicated that there was a significant and large effect of age, such that the older participants' thresholds were 43.8 percent higher than those of the younger participants. Despite the overall adverse effect of age, the pattern of results across the active and passive touch conditions was identical. For both age groups, the curvature discrimination thresholds obtained for passive touch were significantly lower than those that occurred during active touch. Curvature discrimination performance was therefore best in the current study when dynamic cutaneous stimulation occurred in the absence of active movement.",16.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4214c70160c8a6047557769a3d928239/21fe1c18/16.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25473
Learning to find spatially reversed sounds,25,"Adaptation to systematic visual distortions is well-documented but there is little evidence of similar adaptation to radical changes in audition. We use a pseudophone to transpose the sound streams arriving at the left and right ears, evaluating the perceptual effects it provokes and the possibility of learning to locate sounds in the reversed condition. Blindfolded participants remain seated at the center of a semicircular arrangement of 7 speakers and are asked to orient their head towards a sound source. We postulate that a key factor underlying adaptation is the self-generated activity that allows participants to learn new sensorimotor schemes. We investigate passive listening conditions (very short duration stimulus not permitting active exploration) and dynamic conditions (continuous stimulus allowing participants time to freely move their heads or remain still). We analyze head movement kinematics, localization errors, and qualitative reports. Results show movement-induced perceptual disruptions in the dynamic condition with static sound sources displaying apparent movement. This effect is reduced after a short training period and participants learn to find sounds in a left-right reversed field for all but the extreme lateral positions where motor patterns are more restricted. Strategies become less exploratory and more direct with training. Results support the hypothesis that self-generated movements underlie adaptation to radical sensorimotor distortions.",17.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/12f5f73db73c4dca21523eaeef52a67e/4b2913e2/17.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61332-4
Estimation of self-turning in the dark: Comparison between active and passive rotation,28,"The present work compares passive and active rotations in darkness with the aim of characterizing the contribution of efferent and proprioceptive information to the perception of angular displacement. The perception of angular displacements was measured in 12 naive subjects (Ss), who either stood on a rotating platform (passive mode, P) or actively turned about their vertical axis by stepping around 'on the spot' on a stationary platform (active mode, A). Rotations consisted of short acceleration epochs followed by constant velocity periods of 18.5, 37, and 55°/s, with angular displacements ranging from 30°to 810°(presented in a randomized order); in the case of active turning, Ss had learned to approximately produce any of these three velocity levels on command. Ss indicated perceived displacement either verbally (verbal estimation mode, E), or by stopping their rotation when self-displacement appeared to match the magnitude specified by the experimenter (targeting, T). The resulting four conditions (PE, PT, AE, AT) were administered blockwise. In none of the four conditions was there a systematic dependence of perception on turning velocity. Therefore, the results were pooled across velocities, and the Ss' performance was summarized in the form of estimation curves showing median estimates as a function of physical displacement. There were several differences between the passive and active modes: AE- and AT-estimation curves were linear, close to veracity, and fairly similar to each other. In contrast, the PE-curve was curved rightwardly ('saturation'), with small displacements being overestimated and large ones underestimated, whereas the PT-curve was linear and indicated a pronounced overestimation of large displacements. Moreover, both the random and the systematic errors (measures of individual consistency and correctness of individual calibration, respectively) were significantly smaller in the active than in the passive modes. The observed independence of Ss' perception from turning velocity also during passive rotation suggests that the perceptual time constant was significantly longer than 16 s (a value cited as typical for vestibular perception), being possibly 'enhanced' by contextual implications and by expectations of the Ss. The clear improvement of perceptual performance in the active mode testifies to the importance of the efferent and proprioceptive signals arising during active motion. On the assumption that these signals are about as 'noisy' as the vestibular ones, the smaller errors during active turning could result from their combination with the vestibular signal. Alternatively, they could also be intrinsically less noisy than the vestibular signal and simply replace the latter during active motion. In the context of these alternatives (which are not exhaustive), the general problem of sensory fusion is discussed, that is, by which mechanisms are signals from different sensory sources combined to obtain a unified representation of the self's orientation.",18.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/989dfe5d5fe1b27ca5f61db38af92079/04dae47b/18.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,self-rotation/propioception,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002210050872
Context-dependent changes in tactile perception during movement execution,37,"Tactile perception is inhibited during movement execution, a phenomenon known as tactile suppression. Here, we investigated whether the type of movement determines whether or not this form of sensory suppression occurs. Participants performed simple reaching or exploratory movements. Tactile discrimination thresholds were calculated for vibratory stimuli delivered to participants' wrists while executing the movement, and while at rest (a tactile discrimination task, TD). We also measured discrimination performance in a same vs. different task for the explored materials during the execution of the different movements (a surface discrimination task, SD). The TD and SD tasks could either be performed singly or together, both under active movement and passive conditions. Consistent with previous results, tactile thresholds measured at rest were significantly lower than those measured during both active movement and passive touch (that is, tactile suppression was observed). Moreover, SD performance was significantly better under conditions of single-tasking, active movements, as well as exploratory movements, as compared to conditions of dual-tasking, passive movements, and reaching movements, respectively. Therefore, the present results demonstrate that when active hand movements are made with the purpose of gaining information about the surface properties of different materials an enhanced perceptual performance is observed. As such, it would appear that tactile suppression occurs for irrelevant tactual features during both reaching and exploratory movements, but not for those task-relevant features that result from action execution during tactile exploration. Taken together, then, these results support a context-dependent modulation of tactile suppression during movement execution. © 2013 Juravle, McGlone and Spence.",21.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cef908c6e94c45137d48ccac00a4f862/af832f50/21.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00913
Active versus passive proprioceptive straight-ahead pointing in normal subjects,39,"Eighty blindfolded healthy female subjects participated in an active and a passive straight-ahead pointing task to study the estimation of the subjective sagittal middle in the presence or absence of an active haptic exploration. Subjects were to point straight-ahead with their left or right index finger starting from different right- or left-sided locations, while performing either an active movement or with the hand being passively moved by the examiner. Results showed: (i) a significant effect of the hand used only on the active straight-ahead pointing task performance; (ii) a significant effect of the starting position both on the active and passive pointing performance; (iii) a significant correlation between the two protocols only in terms of spatial bias (algebraic error) but not in terms of precision (absolute errors). These results are discussed with regards to normal and neuropsychological studies of the egocentric frame of reference. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Efference Copy Is Necessary for the Attenuation of Self-Generated Touch,43,"Self-generated touch feels less intense than external touch of the same intensity. According to theory, this is because the brain predicts and attenuates the somatosensory consequences of our movements using a copy of the motor command, i.e., the efference copy. However, whether the efference copy is necessary for this somatosensory attenuation is unclear. Alternatively, a predictable contact of two body parts could be sufficient. Here we quantified the attenuation of touch applied on the participants' left index finger when the touch was triggered by the active or passive movement of the right index finger and when it was externally generated. We observed attenuation only when the touch was triggered by the participants' active movement. In contrast, during the passive movement, the touch was perceived to be as strong as when the touch was externally triggered. Our results suggest that the efference copy is necessary for the attenuation of self-generated touch.",26.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/23916625f52e32740c8c613bf596dd00/8a856511/26.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,it's ok even if within the same modality,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.100843
Where is your arm? Variations in proprioception across space and tasks,159,"The sense of limb position is crucial for movement control and environmental interactions. Our understanding of this fundamental proprioceptive process, however, is limited. For example, little is known about the accuracy of arm proprioception: Does it vary with changes in arm configuration, since some peripheral receptors are engaged only when joints move toward extreme angles? Are these variations consistent across different tasks? Does proprioceptive ability change depending on what we try to localize (e.g., fingertip position vs. elbow angle)? We used a robot exoskeleton to study proprioception in 14 arm configurations across three tasks, asking healthy subjects to 1) match a pointer to elbow angles after passive movements, 2) match a pointer to fingertip positions after passive movements, and 3) actively match their elbow angle to a pointer. Across all three tasks, subjects overestimated more extreme joint positions; this may be due to peripheral sensory signals biasing estimates as a safety mechanism to prevent injury. We also found that elbow angle estimates were more precise when used to judge fingertip position versus directly reported, suggesting that the brain has better access to limb endpoint position than joint angles. Finally, precision of elbow angle estimates improved in active versus passive movements, corroborating work showing that efference copies of motor commands and alpha-gamma motor neuron coactivation contribute to proprioceptive estimates. In sum, we have uncovered fundamental aspects of normal proprioceptive processing, demonstrating not only predictable biases that are dependent on joint configuration and independent of task but also improved precision when integrating information across joints.

Heading judgments during active and passive self-motion,44,"Previous studies have generally considered heading perception to be a visual task. However, since judgments of heading direction are required only during self-motion, there are several other relevant senses which could provide supplementary and, in some cases, necessary information to make accurate and precise judgments of the direction of self-motion. We assessed the contributions of several of these senses using tasks chosen to reflect the reference system used by each sensory modality. Head-pointing and rod-pointing tasks were performed in which subjects aligned either the head or an unseen pointer with the direction of motion during whole body linear motion. Passive visual and vestibular stimulation was generated by accelerating subjects at sub- or supravestibular thresholds down a linear track. The motor-kinesthetic system was stimulated by having subjects actively walk along the track. A helmet-mounted optical system, fixed either on the cart used to provide passive visual or vestibular information or on the walker used in the active walking conditions, provided a stereoscopic display of an optical flow field. Subjects could be positioned at any orientation relative to the heading, and heading judgments were obtained using unimodal visual, vestibular, or walking cues, or combined visual-vestibular and visual-walking cues. Vision alone resulted in reasonably precise and accurate head-pointing judgments (0.3° constant errors, 2.9° variable errors), but not rod-pointing judgments (3.5° constant errors, 5.9° variable errors). Concordant visual-walking stimulation slightly decreased the variable errors and reduced constant pointing errors to close to zero, while head-pointing errors were unaffected. Concordant visual-vestibular stimulation did not facilitate either response. Stimulation of the vestibular system in the absence of vision produced imprecise rod-pointing responses, while variable and constant pointing errors in the active walking condition were comparable to those obtained in the visual condition. During active self-motion, subjects made large headpointing undershoots when visual information was not available. These results suggest that while vision provides sufficient information to identify the heading direction, it cannot, in isolation, be used to guide the motor response required to point toward or move in the direction of self-motion. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",29.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f6605167c16b7ee4d178e4d04d72fd38/0417a5f4/29.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00231984
Tactile localization of the direction and distance of sounds,45,"In a previous paper, experiments were reported which demonstrated that human subjects can judge accurately the azimuthal direction of sounds using a tactile localization device. It was also demonstrated that a tactile analogue of selective auditory attention was possible with this system. Three additional experiments, reported here, indicate that subjects are also able to judge the distance of the sound source and can concurrently judge both the azimuthal direction and distance of a source. Comparisons were made between conditions where head movements were permitted lactive~ and conditions where the head was held still Ipassive, and between normal auditory judgments and tactile judgments. Active tactile performance was essentially similar to auditory performance. Active performance was superior to passive in both directional and distance judgment, but different components of the motor-sensory complex were found to contribute to active superiority in the two tasks. The implication of these experiments for the design of auditory prosthetic devices is discussed. © 1979 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",31.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3101adc6b5401cc1eca16afe96e868bf/0eed0046/31.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03198813
A Tactile Virtual Reality for the Study of Active Somatosensation,48,"Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.",34.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2e83bd9c5fa673aa7b7425e7e0665057/a50b8636/34.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2020.00005
Contact force and duration effects on static and dynamic tactile texture discrimination,229,"Tactile roughness magnitude estimates increase with contact force. However, it is not known whether discrimination thresholds are affected by contact force and other parameters, such as duration and tangential movement. The effects of these factors on roughness discrimination thresholds were determined using an adaptive staircase procedure for coarse and fine texture discrimination during active touch. The presence of tangential movement (dynamic touch) significantly reduced thresholds in coarse and fine texture discrimination compared to static touch, with effects more marked with fine textures. Contact force did not affect discrimination except in static touch of coarse texture when the threshold was significantly higher with low force. Within the perspective that texture discrimination involves distinct vibratory and spatial mechanisms, the results suggest that spatial-dependent texture discrimination deteriorates when contact force is reduced whereas vibration-dependent texture discrimination is unaffected by contact force. Texture discrimination was independent of contact duration in the range 1.36s to 3.46s, suggesting that tactile integration processes are completed relatively quickly. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",37.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2eebc074a5e9cc6ad993876d44fd4c97/a3101277/37.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,passive is static,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14075-4_2
The integration and dissociation of thermal and frictional cues during material identification,242,"This study investigated the effects of thermal and frictional cues during a forced-choice material identification task. Thermal properties of the three materials presented (pine, Lexan, aluminum) were conveyed using either real materials or a temperature-controlled aluminum pad to simulate real material effusivities. Friction either varied for the real materials presented, or was constant when the temperature-controlled aluminum simulation pad was presented. Experiments 1 and 2 employed natural materials, while experiments 3 and 4 involved thermal simulations. Thermal cues alone were allowed in experiments 1 and 3 by allowing participants only static exploration with the index finger, with cutaneous contact only in the normal direction. In Experiments 2 and 4, there was dynamic exploration by lateral stroking of the index finger, allowing both thermal and friction cues to be transmitted. Dependent measures included a judgment of the material that was explored, as well as contact forces. The simulation of material effusivity was shown to be valid as participants had identification accuracies that were similar to real materials during static exploration. Material, identification accuracy was higher when congruent cues were presented and was lower when incongruent cues were presented. Peak normal force was higher during static exploration, compared to dynamic. These results were interpreted in terms of a framework, of single modality competition and cooperation. © 2008 IEEE.",41.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/70ae1c413a14fa6885a44435b384302c/248a56e5/41.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,passive as static,https://doi.org/10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479906
Multisensory integration in the estimation of walked distances,54,"When walking through space, both dynamic visual information (optic flow) and body-based information (proprioceptive and vestibular) jointly specify the magnitude of distance travelled. While recent evidence has demonstrated the extent to which each of these cues can be used independently, less is known about how they are integrated when simultaneously present. Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.09) or incongruent (0.7 × or 1.4 ×) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking. These observed results were effectively described using a basic linear weighting model. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",43.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a756e2a9674a705da6e6de042a78c5d4/f2882a28/43.pdf),checked,checked,checked,"Not sure.

Illusion of Wetness by Dynamic Touch,56,"Humans perceive wetness on contact with a dry-cold material; however, the magnitude of wetness that can be perceived using dynamic touch remains unclear. This study assessed how the type of touch, namely hand movement (either statically or dynamically) and pressing force (either low or high pressure), affect the perception of wetness. The participants judged the magnitude of perceived wetness after four types of touch of four stimuli comprising four fabrics of varying water content and surface temperatures. Overall, the perceived wetness was differed between static and dynamic touch independent of pressure and the participants scored the dry-cold stimulus as relatively dry for dynamic touch. Furthermore, cluster analysis revealed individual differences in the recognition of wetness in dynamic touch conditions. These results revealed the variability in the mechanisms used by humans to perceive wetness.

A comparison of visual and two modes of tactual letter resolution,57,"Confusion matrices were obtained for visual letter recognition and for tactual letter recognition with (1) the finger held stationary on small raised letters and (2) the finger allowed to scan them. In each sensory mode, performance was investigated at four letter sizes, with heights ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 min of arc for vision and from 3.0 to 8.0 mm for touch. The two tactual modes yielded similar recognition performance, although performance was always better in the scanned mode. For both vision and touch, performance appeared to be limited by primary receptor spacing. Letter heights corresponding to 50% correct identification (vision, 2.2 rain arc; scanned touch, 4 ram; static touch, 5 ram) spanned about five receptor spacings in each sensory system, indicating that the dimensional equivalence of vision and touch is determined by receptor spacing rather than central factors. The patterns of letter confusions and the productmoment correlations for correct identifications (vision vs. static touch, 0.83; vision vs. scanned touch, 0.75; and static touch vs. scanned touch, 0.89, all taken at comparable performance levels) imply that similar spatial processes are involved in the different modes. © 1983 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",46.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f1b8f390176d8a29b2dd060730b972ce/46a27e44/46.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,passive here means static,https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03202952
Haptic discrimination of two-dimensional angles: Influence of exploratory strategy,58,"The aim of this study was to define the relative contribution of self-generated cutaneous and proprioceptive feedback to haptic shape discrimination by systematically constraining the exploratory strategy. Subjects (n = 23) explored pairs of two-dimensional (2-D) angles (standard angle, 90°; comparison angles, 91°-103°) placed at arm's length from the subject, and identified the larger angle of each pair. The exploratory strategies included a reference condition, dynamic scan of the index finger over the entire object [combined cutaneous and proprioceptive (shoulder) feedback], and modified conditions, static touch of the intersection of the two bars that formed the angle using the index finger (cutaneous feedback) and dynamic scans of the object using a hand-held tool (proprioceptive feedback, shoulder). Discrimination thresholds (75% correct) were very similar for dynamic and static touch with the index finger. Thresholds varied as a function of the static contact duration (<1 s, 7.2° ± 0.6°; ∼3 s, 4.2° ± 0.5°), but were not different from the reference condition (6.0° ± 0.9°). The higher threshold with short static touch likely reflects movement-related gating of self-generated tactile inputs. Together, the results suggested that cutaneous feedback alone may be sufficient to explain 2-D angle discrimination, because the added proprioceptive feedback did not improve performance. Also, threshold did not vary with the number of dynamic scans (one or two), suggesting that the critical information was gathered on the first pass over the angle. In contrast, when the angles were explored with the tool, the threshold increased relative to the corresponding reference condition from the same session (tool, 9.6° ± 0.9°; dynamic scan with the finger, 6.2° ± 1.0°). Thus, performance was poorer with proprioceptive feedback alone, suggesting that cutaneous feedback was relatively more important for 2-D haptic angle discrimination in the present experiment. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",48.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ad6ce543277f853a51dfee3ee1e6f3a1/78a17ca1/48.pdf),checked,checked,checked,,,passive here means static,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-006-0728-8
Specificity and coherence of body representations,346,"Bodily illusions differently affect body representations underlying perception and action. We investigated whether this task dependence reflects two distinct dimensions of embodiment: the sense of agency and the sense of the body as a coherent whole. In experiment 1 the sense of agency was manipulated by comparing active versus passive movements during the induction phase in a video rubber hand illusion (vRHI) setup. After induction, proprioceptive biases were measured both by perceptual judgments of hand position, as well as by measuring end-point accuracy of subjects' active pointing movements to an external object with the affected hand. The results showed, first, that the vRHI is largely perceptual: passive perceptual localisation judgments were altered, but end-point accuracy of active pointing responses with the affected hand to an external object was unaffected. Second, within the perceptual judgments, there was a novel congruence effect, such that perceptual biases were larger following passive induction of vRHI than following active induction. There was a trend for the converse effect for pointing responses, with larger pointing bias following active induction. In experiment 2, we used the traditional RHI to investigate the coherence of body representation by synchronous stimulation of either matching or mismatching fingers on the rubber hand and the participant's own hand. Stimulation of matching fingers induced a local proprioceptive bias for only the stimulated finger, but did not affect the perceived shape of the hand as a whole. In contrast, stimulation of spatially mismatching fingers eliminated the RHI entirely. The present results show that (i) the sense of agency during illusion induction has specific effects, depending on whether we represent our body for perception or to guide action, and (ii) representations of specific body parts can be altered without affecting perception of the spatial configuration of the body as a whole. © 2009 a Pion publication.",49.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/85f5951692cfe93059a36939c44e4155/ce27711f/49.pdf),checked,checked,checked,"I think that we should include it, but we can discuss it because it is not so clear",I have doubts since they have to judge video recordings ,only experiment 1,https://doi.org/10.1068/p6389
Texture perception in sighted and blind observers,59,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the utility of visual imagery for texture perception. In Experiment 1, sighted, early-blind, and late-blind observers made relative smoothness judgments of abrasive surfaces using active or passive touch. In Experiment 2, subjects compared vision and touch in the accuracy of smoothness detection, using a broad range of textures, including very fine surfaces. No differences appeared between the sighted and the blind, and it did not matter if touch were active or passive. Vision and touch showed similar performance with relatively coarse textures, but touch was superior to vision for much finer surface textures. The results were consistent with the notion that visual ceding of tactual stimuli is not advantageous (or necessary) for texture perception, since touch may hold advantages for the detection of the smoothness of surfaces. © 1989 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",50.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c4ea44a773af565a7bb7aef76c3251a4/52fb174f/50.pdf),checked,checked,checked,Data for sighted OK,,only experiment 1,https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03208032
Regional differences intaste responsiveness: Effect of stimulus andtasting mode,53,"Previous studies have shown that there are differences in taste responses between various regions of the tongue. Most of those studies used a controlled “passive” tasting mode due to the nature of investigation. However, food is rarely tasted in a passive manner. In addition, recent studies have suggested that humans can taste maltooligosaccharides (MOS) and that the gustatory detection of MOS is independent of the known sweet receptor. It is unknown whether regional differences in responsiveness to MOS exist. This study was set up to revisit previous work by investigating the effects of tasting mode (“passive” vs. “active”) on regional differences in taste responsiveness to sucrose, monopotassium glutamate (MPG), and quinine, while also investigating potential regional differences in responsiveness to MOS. The stimuli were applied to 1 of 4 target areas, the left and right sides of the front and back of the tongue, using cotton-tipped swabs. In the passive tasting condition, the front of the tongue was found to be more responsive to both sucrose and MOS, but no regional differences were seen for quinine and MPG. In contrast, in the active tasting condition, the back of the tongue was found to be more responsive to quinine and MPG, but no differences were found for sucrose or MOS. These findings indicate that there are regional differences in taste responsiveness between the front and back of the tongue and that regional responsiveness is dependent on stimulus and tasting mode.",40.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cb5a5cb8dd744f741125e41848d32a1a/9f38041e/40.pdf),checked,checked,,,great! :D,the goal of the study is not to compare the quality of perception depending on active-passive mode but the role of different tongue regions,https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjy055
Softness discrimination with a tool,150,"The abilities of humans to discriminate the softness of rubber objects of differing compliance with a handheld tool (a stylus) was measured under experimental conditions that differed as to how the tool was used and the kind of sensory information available. When the subject actively tapped or pressed the compliant objects, they discriminated softness as well by means of a stylus as they did by contacting the objects directly with the fingerpad. Discrimination with the stylus was unaffected by whether the stylus was controlled by one or two fingers. While tapping or pressing a stylus held in a precision grip, the grip force increased before, reached a maximum at the same time as, and decreased in parallel with the compressional force. This relationship was suggestive of anticipatory motor control based on an internal model of the motor system and the physical properties of the object. Discrimination was significantly better when tapping as opposed to pressing the objects with the stylus. This was hypothesized as due to the presence of tactile cues generated by the rapid increase in force rate as the stylus struck and indented the object during tapping. During tapping, the magnitude and rate of compressional force produced by the stylus against the object were greater, the harder the object. An additional cue, possibly kinesthetic, during pressing and tapping was the magnitude of indentation of the specimen by the stylus that was greater, the softer the object. Subjects could discriminate differences on softness by tactile cues alone in the absence of kinesthetic when compliant objects were tapped at approximately the same velocity by the experimenter against a stylus in contact with the subject's passive fingerpad. Discrimination deteriorated if the softer specimen of a pair was tapped with a slightly greater velocity than the harder and not possible if the specimens were pressed against the stylus without generating tactile cues of mechanical contact. In contrast, discrimination was possible during active pressing and unaffected by variations in velocity during active tapping. It is concluded that during active movements, kinesthetic information and knowledge of central efferent commands provide useful cues that are not present during passive touch. These cues allow the observer to discriminate differences in object compliance not confounded by differences in applied velocity.",27.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/67d60ae85a72b140e9eb3839125f8f67/5cf85e66/27.pdf),checked,,checked,I think we cannot include this.

Perceiving your hand moving: BOLD suppression in sensory cortices and the role of the cerebellum in the detection of feedback delays,337,"Sensory consequences of self-generated as opposed to externally generated movements are perceived as less intense and lead to less neural activity in corresponding sensory cortices, presumably due to predictive mechanisms. Self-generated sensory inputs have been mostly studied in a single modality, using abstract feedback, with control conditions not differentiating efferent from reafferent feedback. Here we investigated the neural processing of (a) naturalistic action-feedback associations of (b) self-generated versus externally generated movements, and (c) how an additional (auditory) modality influences neural processing and detection of delays. Participants executed wrist movements using a passive movement device (PMD) as they watched their movements in real time or with variable delays (0-417 ms). The task was to judge whether there was a delay between the movement and its visual feedback. In the externally generated condition, movements were induced by the PMD to disentangle efferent from reafferent feedback. Half of the trials involved auditory beeps coupled to the onset of the visual feedback. We found reduced BOLD activity in visual, auditory, and somatosensory areas during selfgenerated compared with externally generated movements in unimodal and bimodal conditions. Anterior and posterior cerebellar areas were engaged for trials in which action-feedback delays were detected for self-generated movements. Specifically, the left cerebellar lobule IX was functionally connected with the right superior occipital gyrus. The results indicate efference copy-based predictive mechanisms specific to self-generated movements, leading to BOLD suppression in sensory areas. In addition, our results support the cerebellum's role in the detection of temporal prediction errors during our actions and their consequences.",47.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/832f347f608661d991d5f8595b58bfae/19c74c0f/47.pdf),checked,,,,"I have doubts since they have to judge video recordings

Passive and active discrimination of natural frequency of virtual dynamic systems,6,"It has been shown that humans use combined feedforward and feedback control strategies when manipulating external dynamic systems and when exciting virtual dynamic systems at resonance and that they can tune their control parameters in response to changing natural frequencies. We present a study to determine the discrimination thresholds for the natural frequency of such resonant dynamic systems. Weber fractions (WF, %) are reported for the discrimination of 1, 2, 4, and 8 Hz natural frequencies. Participants were instructed either to passively perceive or actively excite the virtual system via a one degree-of-freedom haptic interface with visual and/or haptic feedback. The average WF for natural frequency ranged from 4% to 8.5% for 1, 2, and 4 Hz reference natural frequencies, while the WF was approximately 20% for systems with a reference natural frequency of 8 Hz. Results indicate that sensory feedback modality has a significant effect on WF during passive perception, but no significant effect in the active perception case. The data also suggest that discrimination sensitivity is not significantly affected by excitation mode. Finally, results for systems with equivalent natural frequencies but different spring stiffness indicate that participants do not discriminate natural frequency based on the maximum force magnitude perceived. © 2010 IEEE.",03.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2918c1d6da7a2f99b605770d82f6f6a7/fa33c1be/03.pdf),,checked,checked,,they only extract neural data,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2008.21
Early interaction between vision and touch during binocular rivalry,14," Growing evidence shows that early sensory areas are involved in cross-modal processing, challenging the traditional view that confined multisensory analysis to high-level temporal and parietal areas. Haptic signals have been shown to influence the dynamics of binocular rivalry, a form of perceptual bistability that engages competition between monocular signals (Lunghi et al. , 2010, Current Biology , 20 (4), R143–R144). We investigated the role of spatial proximity, type of tactile stimulation (active or passive) and cross-modal attention in promoting fusion between vision and touch during binocular rivalry of orthogonally oriented gratings (±45°, size 2.5°, SF 2 c/cm). By varying the haptic orientation (±7.5°, ±15°, ±30°), we further investigated the orientation selectivity of the interaction. We found that both active exploration and passive tactile stimulation boosted the visual stimulus congruent with the tactile one (engraved grating), both prolonging conscious perception and restoring it from binocular rivalry suppression. The interaction was strictly tuned (less than one octave) to visuo-haptic spatial frequency and orientation. We also found that voluntary attention played a minor role in mediating the interaction, while temporal alignment and spatial proximity between visual and tactile stimuli were necessary for fusion of the cross-sensory signals, this latter result suggesting that the visual and the somatosensory spatial maps are aligned. Taken together, our results points to a very early multisensory interaction site, possibly V1.

Transfer of the curvature aftereffect in dynamic touch,50,"A haptic curvature aftereffect is a phenomenon in which the perception of a curved shape is systematically altered by previous contact to curvature. In the present study, the existence and intermanual transfer of curvature aftereffects for dynamic touch were investigated. Dynamic touch is characterized by motion contact between a finger and a stimulus. A distinction was made between active and passive contact of the finger on the stimulus surface. We demonstrated the occurrence of a dynamic curvature aftereffect and found a complete intermanual transfer of this aftereffect, which suggests that dynamically obtained curvature information is represented at a high level. In contrast, statically perceived curvature information is mainly processed at a level that is connected to a single hand, as previous studies indicated. Similar transfer effects were found for active and passive dynamic touch, but a stronger aftereffect was obtained when the test surface was actively touched. We conclude that the representation of object information depends on the exploration mode that is used to acquire information. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Similar mechanisms underlie curvature comparison by static and dynamic touch,55,"In four experiments, we tested whether haptic comparison of curvature ranging from -4/m to +4/m is qualitatively the same for static and for dynamic touch. In Experiments 1 and 3, we tested whether static and dynamic curvature discrimination are based on height differences, attitude (slope) differences, curvature differences, or a combination of these geometrical variables. It was found that both static and dynamic haptic curvature discrimination are based on attitude differences. In Experiments 2 and 4, we tested whether this mechanism leads to errors in the comparison of stimuli with different lengths for static and dynamic touch, respectively. If the judgments are based on attitude differences, subjects will make systematic errors in these comparisons. In both experiments, we found that subjects compared the curvatures of strips of the same length veridically, whereas they made systematic errors if they were required to compare the curvatures of strips of different lengths. Longer stimuli were judged to be more curved than shorter stimuli with the same curvature. We conclude that similar mechanisms underlie static and dynamic haptic curvature comparison. Moreover, additional data comparison showed that static and dynamic curvature comparison is not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively similar.",44.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/93f26ec1e0702982b7d424a740434ebe/b599a36e/44.pdf),,checked,checked,I don't see the comparison we look for.,,passive here means static,https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03206903
Tactile exploration of virtual objects for blind and sighted people: The role of beta 1 EEG band in sensory substitution and supramodal mental mapping,12,"The neural correlates of exploration and cognitive mapping in blindness remain elusive. The role of visuo-spatial pathways in blind vs. sighted subjects is still under debate. In this preliminary study, we investigate, as a possible estimation of the activity in the visuo-spatial pathways, the EEG patterns of blind and blindfolded-sighted subjects during the active tactile construction of cognitive maps from virtual objects compared with rest and passive tactile stimulation. Ten blind and ten matched, blindfolded-sighted subjects participated in the study. Events were defined as moments when the finger was only stimulated (passive stimulation) or the contour of a virtual object was touched (during active exploration). Event-related spectral power and coherence perturbations were evaluated within the beta 1 band (14-18 Hz). They were then related to a subjective cognitive-load estimation required by the explorations [namely, perceived levels of difficulty (PLD)]. We found complementary cues for sensory substitution and spatial processing in both groups: both blind and sighted subjects showed, while exploring, late power decreases and early power increases, potentially associated with motor programming and touch, respectively. The latter involved occipital areas only for blind subjects (long-term plasticity) and only during active exploration, thus supporting tactile-to-visual sensory substitution. In both groups, coherences emerged among the fronto-central, centro-parietal, and occipito-temporal derivations associated with visuo-spatial processing. This seems in accordance with mental map construction involving spatial processing, sensory-motor processing, and working memory. The observed involvement of the occipital regions suggests that a substitution process also occurs in sighted subjects. Only during explorations did coherence correlate positively with PLD for both groups and in derivations, which can be related to visuo-spatial processing, supporting the existence of supramodal spatial processing independently of vision capabilities. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.",08.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/23ec765182592de7713bd19b24019770/7f9ed73a/08.pdf),,checked,,No behavioral data,there are blindfolded participants and they do not only take leg into account,only neural data reported,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00624.2011
The relative timing of active and passive touch,41,"Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Roles of Force Cues and Proprioceptive Joint Angles in Active Exploration of Compliant Objects,16,"We employ distinct exploratory procedures to improve our perceptual judgments of an object's properties. For instance, with respect to compliance, we exert pressure against a resisting force. The present work investigates ties between strategies for active control of the finger and resultant cues by which compliances may be discriminated. In particular, we employ elastic spheres that co-vary in compliance and radius, as these generate non-differentiable contact areas and are discriminable only in active touch with proprioceptive inputs. During human-subjects psychophysical experiments, we measure touch force, fingertip displacement, and joint kinematics. Two active touch paradigms are used, with and without a force constraint. First, in behaviorally-controlled situations that make force cues non-useful, the results indicate that participants can employ a force-matching strategy between the compliant objects and rely upon displacement-related cues to differentiate them. We show these cues are directly tied to a proprioception mechanism, specifically, the angle of the MCP joint. However, in the fully active paradigm, participants control displacements instead and discriminate via force-related cues. Similar to prior findings in passive touch, we find that force-related cues, likewise, are used in active touch for the optimal and efficient discrimination of compliant objects.",10.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/80c06c5335ddb79f20198c0f03d795f8/82037519/10.pdf),,,checked,"I would check the differences between the two active conditions.

Short psychotherapy in the treatment of psychosomatic vascular disorders,62,"Essential hypertension is one of the most frequent vascular and most typical psychosomatic diseases. The casual therapy is psychotherapy in a form of a short analysis dynamically oriented. This paper deals with the method and results obtained by short psychotherapy of 60 patients with essential hypertension, aged between 23 and 54. The therapeutic procedure is directed to the patients and to the patient-therapist conflict and interaction. The autopsychic conflict of not being able to invest a whole personality into the task of treatment was revealed in each patient. If free associations were manifested in the patient, the further treatment was aimed at revealing symptomatology and actual conflicts. Dispositions with aggressive tendencies were psychoreactively discovered, whereas, as relates the characters, those patients were extremely gay and vital personalities. The therapist's attitude kept varying from a passive listening to an active perceiving of emotional oscillations, never being that of a transfer neurosis. In achieving a therapeutical goal, a positive motivation was proved to be significant. Only in four patients the failure in treatment was due to a negative motivation and inability to choose a substitute. Although the estimation of short psychotherapy outcome based on the improvement of symptoms in essential hypertension has not been scientifically confirmed, it cannot be refuted as well, because each positive outcome is considered useful for the patient.",,,,,,"""The therapist's attitude kept varying from a passive listening to an active perceiving of emotional oscillations"" nothing related to our topic",,
On the relative complexity of active vs. passive visual search,63,"Here, this author attempts to tie the concept of active perception to attentive processing in general and to the complexity level analysis of visual search described previously; the aspects of active vision as they have been currently described form a subset of the full spectrum of attentional capabilities. Our approach is motivated by the search requirements of vision tasks and thus we cast the problem as one of search preceding the application of methods for shape-from-X, optical flow, etc., and recognition in general. This perspective permits a dimension of analysis not found in current formulations of the active perception problem, that of computational complexity. This article describes where the active perception paradigm does and does not provide computational benefits along this dimension. A formalization of the search component of active perception is presented in order to accomplish this. The link to attentional mechanisms is through the control of data acquisition and processing by the active process. It should be noted that the analysis performed here applies to the general hypothesize-and-test search strategy, to time-varying scenes as well as to the general problem of integration of successive fixations.

Active touch for robust perception under position uncertainty,2,"In this paper, we propose that active perception will help attain autonomous robotics in unstructured environments by giving robust perception. We test this claim with a biomimetic fingertip that senses surface texture under a range of contact depths. We compare the performance of passive Bayesian perception with a novel approach for active perception that includes a sensorimotor loop for controlling sensor position. Passive perception at a single depth gave poor results, with just 0.2mm uncertainty impairing performance. Extending passive perception over a range of depths gave non-robust performance. Only active perception could give robust, accurate performance, with the sensorimotor feedback compensating the position uncertainty. We expect that these results will extend to other stimuli, so that active perception will offer a general approach to robust perception in unstructured environments. © 2013 IEEE.",,,,,"We have to discuss if robots are going to be included.

Active force perception depends on cerebellar function,3,"Damage to the cerebellum causes characteristic movement abnormalities but is thought to have minimal impact on somatosensory perception. Traditional clinical assessments of patients with cerebellar lesions reveal no perceptual deficits despite the fact that the cerebellum receives substantial somatosensory information. Given that abnormalities have been reported in predicting the visual consequences of movement, we suspect that the cerebellum broadly participates in perception when motor output is required (i.e., active perception). Thus we hypothesize that cerebellar integrity is essential for somatosensory perception that requires motor activity, but not passive somatosensory perception. We compared the perceptual acuity of human cerebellar patients to that of healthy control subjects in several different somatosensory perception tasks with minimal visual information. We found that patients were worse at active force and stiffness discrimination but similar to control subjects with regard to passive cutaneous force detection, passive proprioceptive detection, and passive proprioceptive discrimination. Furthermore, the severity of movement symptoms as assessed by a clinical exam was positively correlated with impairment of active force perception. Notably, within the context of these perceptual tasks, control subjects and cerebellar patients displayed similar movement characteristics, and hence differing movement strategies are unlikely to underlie the differences in perception. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is vital to sensory prediction of self-generated movement and suggest a general role for the cerebellum in multiple forms of active perception. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.",,,,,"No, excluded given they used patients for the ""passive conditions)","control subjects might be of interest: ""We compared the perceptual acuity of human cerebellar patients to that of healthy control subjects in several different somatosensory perception tasks with minimal visual information.

Active visual perception for mobile robot localization,65,"Localization is a key issue for a mobile robot, in particular in environments where a globally accurate positioning system, such as GPS, is not available. In these environments, accurate and efficient robot localization is not a trivial task, as an increase in accuracy usually leads to an impoverishment in efficiency and viceversa. Active perception appears as an appealing way to improve the localization process by increasing the richness of the information acquired from the environment. In this paper, we present an active perception strategy for a mobile robot provided with a visual sensor mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism. The visual sensor has a limited field of view, so the goal of the active perception strategy is to use the pan-tilt unit to direct the sensor to informative parts of the environment. To achieve this goal, we use a topological map of the environment and a Bayesian non-parametric estimation of robot position based on a particle filter. We slightly modify the regular implementation of this filter by including an additional step that selects the best perceptual action using Monte Carlo estimations. We understand the best perceptual action as the one that produces the greatest reduction in uncertainty about the robot position. We also consider in our optimization function a cost term that favors efficient perceptual actions. Previous works have proposed active perception strategies for robot localization, but mainly in the context of range sensors, grid representations of the environment, and parametric techniques, such as the extended Kalman filter. Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are: i) Development of a sound strategy for active selection of perceptual actions in the context of a visual sensor and a topological map; ii) Real time operation using a modified version of the particle filter and Monte Carlo based estimations; iii) Implementation and testing of these ideas using simulations and a real case scenario. Our results indicate that, in terms of accuracy of robot localization, the proposed approach decreases mean average error and standard deviation with respect to a passive perception scheme. Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, the active scheme is able to operate in real time without adding a relevant overhead to the regular robot operation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,,,"No, same reason than 4",robots,,10.1007/s10846-009-9348-4
Integration of passive and active vision for range calculation in 2D images,66,"Computer vision is a complicated process. It involves the acquisition of sensed data, extracting relevant information from it and organizing the resulting information in a mathematical and symbolic representation for reasoning purposes. In this paper, we introduce a new method for the acquisition of range information associated with points on 2D images. The irregular triangular mesh (ITM), which is a feature-based modeling technique, is used to synthesize 3D models for the observed scenes. The correspondence between the ITM features and those extracted from the 2D images leads to the integration of active and passive vision. The addition of the range information to 2D intensity images is useful in various applications. While the modeling phase synthesizes the ITM off-line, it is suitable for real-time applications where range information is a key element. Additionally, it is adequate for guiding data acquisition using laser digitizer to acquire the range at selected points of interest. Thus, using monocular vision, accurate 3D knowledge of scenes and objects is synthesized. This technique was tested on a robot cap.",,,,,,testing with robots,,
Microsaccades for neuromorphic stereo vision,67,"Depth perception through stereo vision is an important feature of biological and artificial vision systems. While biological systems can compute disparities effortlessly, it requires intensive processing for artificial vision systems. The computing complexity resides in solving the correspondence problem – finding matching pairs of points in the two eyes. Inspired by the retina, event-based vision sensors allow a new constraint to solve the correspondence problem: time. Relying on precise spike-time, spiking neural networks can take advantage of this constraint. However, disparities can only be computed from dynamic environments since event-based vision sensors only report local changes in light intensity. In this paper, we show how microsaccadic eye movements can be used to compute disparities from static environments. To this end, we built a robotic head supporting two Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capable of independent panning and simultaneous tilting. We evaluate the method on both static and dynamic scenes perceived through microsaccades.

Active sensorimotor control for tactile exploration,68,"In this paper, we present a novel and robust Bayesian approach for autonomous active exploration of unknown objects using tactile perception and sensorimotor control. Despite recent advances in tactile sensing, robust active exploration remains a challenging problem, which is a major hurdle to the practical deployment of tactile sensors in robots. Our proposed approach is based on a Bayesian perception method that actively controls the sensor with local small repositioning movements to reduce perception uncertainty, followed by explorative movements based on the outcome of each perceptual decision making step. Two sensorimotor control strategies are proposed for improving the accuracy and speed of the active exploration that weight the evidence from previous exploratory steps through either a weighted prior or weighted posterior. The methods are validated both off-line and in real-time on a contour following exploratory procedure. Results clearly demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and exploration time when using the proposed active methods compared to passive perception. Our work demonstrates that active perception has the potential to enable robots to perform robust autonomous tactile exploration in natural environments.",,,,,,robots,,10.1016/j.robot.2016.09.014
The effect of motor action and different sensory modalities on terrain classification in a quadruped robot running with multiple gaits,69,"Discriminating or classifying different terrains is an important ability for every autonomous mobile robot. A variety of sensors, preprocessing techniques, and algorithms in different robots were applied. However, little attention was paid to the way sensory data was generated and to the contribution of different sensory modalities. In this work, a quadruped robot traversing different grounds using a variety of gaits is used, equipped with a collection of proprioceptive (encoders on active, and passive compliant joints), inertial, and foot pressure sensors. The effect of different gaits on classification performance is assessed and it is demonstrated that separate terrain classifiers for each motor program should be employed. Furthermore, poor performance of randomly generated motor commands confirms the importance of coordinated behavior on sensory information structuring. The collection of sensors sensitive to active, ""tactile"", terrain exploration proved effective.

The Cat is on the Mat. or is it a Dog? Dynamic competition in perceptual decision making,5,"Recent neurobiological findings suggest that the brain solves simple perceptual decision-making tasks by means of a dynamic competition in which evidence is accumulated in favor of the alternatives. However, it is unclear if and how the same process applies in more complex, real-world tasks, such as the categorization of ambiguous visual scenes and what elements are considered as evidence in this case. Furthermore, dynamic decision models typically consider evidence accumulation as a passive process disregarding the role of active perception strategies. In this paper, we adopt the principles of dynamic competition and active vision for the realization of a biologically-motivated computational model, which we test in a visual categorization task. Moreover, our system uses predictive power of the features as the main dimension for both evidence accumulation and the guidance of active vision. Comparison of human and synthetic data in a common experimental setup suggests that the proposed model captures essential aspects of how the brain solves perceptual ambiguities in time. Our results point to the importance of the proposed principles of dynamic competition, parallel specification, and selection of multiple alternatives through prediction, as well as active guidance of perceptual strategies for perceptual decision-making and the resolution of perceptual ambiguities. These principles could apply to both the simple perceptual decision problems studied in neuroscience and the more complex ones addressed by vision research. © 2013 IEEE.",02.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fd41fd54e0122553fb3a5a1b3d94d438/4cb7cbde/02.pdf),,,,"It could be relevant if they show this ""Comparison of human (and synthetic) data in a common experimental setup"" ",categorization of abstract forms,not a relevant topic (dynamics in perceptual categorization),https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2013.2279664
Study on visuo-tactile sensory integration in shape perception,7,"Experiments on adaptation to distorted visual and tactile rectangles were carried out to investigate interactions between visuo-tactile sensory integration and active perception in shape perception. The interactions have two aspects: the effects of active perception on sensory integration and the effects of sensory integration on active perception. Therefore, the first part of this paper discusses sensory integration with active and passive touch, and the second part discusses the changes of active touch finger movement in the sensory integration process. During the experiments, cross-modal reaction tests were held to evaluate adaptation to the vertical/horizontal ratio of shapes. Amount of sensory integration was estimated by this evaluation. There are two features of sensory integration with active touch: perception with voluntary finger movement and perception with synchronized visual and tactile information. Therefore, comparisons were made first between adaptation experiments with voluntary touch and that with passive touch, and secondly among that with successive visual and tactile stimulation, that with concurrent stimulation, and that with concurrent stimulation with visualized finger movement which strengthened the synchronization. The first comparison showed that adaptation of subjects with voluntary touch was greater than that of those with passive touch. The second comparison showed that adaptation was enhanced by visualized finger movement. Thus, voluntariness and intermodal synchronization of active perception were important factors in sensory integration. In these adaptation experiments, the finger movements by which the subjects actively obtain tactile information of shapes were measured by PSD camera. From position data of the finger, maximum velocities of movement were calculated, and the finger movement system was identified by applying ARMA model. When subjects were exposed to visual and tactile information concurrently either with or without visualized finger movement, maximum velocities of finger movement increased as the experiment proceed. In order to observe changes in finger movement systems, simulations of identified systems were performed. Simulated step responses of finger movement showed that rise time shortened as the experiment proceeded. These results suggested that sensory integration causes a quick response of active touch to visual information.

Autonomous active exploration for tactile sensing in robotics,70,"The sense of touch permits humans to directly touch, feel and perceive the state of their surrounding environment. For an exploration task, humans normally reduce uncertainty by actively moving their hands and fingers towards more interesting locations. This active exploration is a sophisticated procedure that involves sensing and perception processes. In robotics, the sense of touch also plays an important role for the development of intelligent systems capable to safely explore and interact with their environment. However, robust and accurate sensing and perception methods, crucial to exploit the benefits offered by the sense of touch, still represents a major research challenge in the field of robotics. A novel method for sensing and perception in robotics using the sense of touch is developed in this research work. This novel active Bayesian perception method, biologically inspired by humans, demonstrates its superiority over passive perception modality, achieving accurate tactile perception with a biomimetic fingertip sensor. The accurate results are accomplished by the accumulation of evidence through the interaction with the environment, and by actively moving the biomimetic fingertip sensor towards better locations to improve perception as humans do. A contour following exploration, commonly used by humans to extract object shape, was used to validate the proposed method using simulated and real objects. The exploration procedure demonstrated the ability of the tactile sensor to autonomously interact, performing active movements to improve the perception from the contour of the objects being explored, in a natural way as humans do. An investigation of the effects on the perception and decisions taken by the combination of the experience acquired along an exploration task with the active Bayesian perception process is also presented. This investigation, based on two novel sensorimotor control strategies (SMC1 and SMC2), was able to improve the performance in speed and accuracy of the exploration task. To exploit the benefits of the control strategies in a realistic exploration, the learning of a forward model and confidence factor was needed. For that reason, a novel method based on the combination of Predicted Information Gain (PIG) and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) permitted to achieve an online and adaptive learning of the forward model and confidence factor, allowing to improve the performance of the exploration task for both sensorimotor control strategies. Overall, the novel methods presented in this thesis, validated in simulated and real environments, demonstrated to be robust, accurate and suitable for robots to perform autonomous active perception and exploration using the sense touch.",,,,,"No, robot",robots,robots,

Plasticity in neuromagnetic cortical responses suggests enhanced auditory object representation,73,"Background: Auditory perceptual learning persistently modifies neural networks in the central nervous system. Central auditory processing comprises a hierarchy of sound analysis and integration, which transforms an acoustical signal into a meaningful object for perception. Based on latencies and source locations of auditory evoked responses, we investigated which stage of central processing undergoes neuroplastic changes when gaining auditory experience during passive listening and active perceptual training. Young healthy volunteers participated in a five-day training program to identify two pre-voiced versions of the stop-consonant syllable 'ba', which is an unusual speech sound to English listeners. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain responses were recorded during two pre-training and one post-training sessions. Underlying cortical sources were localized, and the temporal dynamics of auditory evoked responses were analyzed. Results: After both passive listening and active training, the amplitude of the P2m wave with latency of 200 ms increased considerably. By this latency, the integration of stimulus features into an auditory object for further conscious perception is considered to be complete. Therefore the P2m changes were discussed in the light of auditory object representation. Moreover, P2m sources were localized in anterior auditory association cortex, which is part of the antero-ventral pathway for object identification. The amplitude of the earlier N1m wave, which is related to processing of sensory information, did not change over the time course of the study.Conclusion: The P2m amplitude increase and its persistence over time constitute a neuroplastic change. The P2m gain likely reflects enhanced object representation after stimulus experience and training, which enables listeners to improve their ability for scrutinizing fine differences in pre-voicing time. Different trajectories of brain and behaviour changes suggest that the preceding effect of a P2m increase relates to brain processes, which are necessary precursors of perceptual learning.

"Bouncing between model and data: Stability, passivity, and optimality in hybrid dynamics",9,"Rhythmically bouncing a ball with a racket is a seemingly simple task, but it poses all the challenges critical for coordinative behavior: perceiving the ball's trajectory to adapt position and velocity of the racket for the next ball contact. To gain insight into the underlying control strategies, the authors conducted a series of studies that tested models with experimental data, with an emphasis on deriving model-based hypotheses and trying to falsify them. Starting with a simple dynamical model of the racket and ball interactions, stability analyses showed that open-loop dynamics affords dynamical stability, such that small perturbations do not require corrections. To obtain this passive stability, the ball has to be impacted with negative accelerationa strategy that subjects adopted in a variety of conditions at steady state. However, experimental tests that applied perturbations revealed that after perturbations, subjects applied active perceptually guided corrections to reestablish steady state faster than by relying on the passive model's relaxation alone. Hence, the authors derived a model with active control based on optimality principles that considered each impact as a separate reaching-like movement. This model captured some additional features of the racket trajectory but failed to predict more fine-grained aspects of performance. The authors proceed to present a new model that accounts not only for fine-grained behavior but also reconciles passive and active control approaches with new predictions that will be put to test in the next set of experiments.

The effect of active versus passive exploration on memory for spatial location in children.,77,"The effect of active exploration upon memory for spatial location of an event was assessed for children at 2 age levels. Each child took a walk through the same unfamiliar hallway in search of a hidden object which he was later asked to relocate. Half the children were accompanied by an adult holding their hand (passive condition), while the other half proceeded on their own with an adult following behind (active condition). An age x condition interaction revealed that active exploration significantly improved performance of the 3- and 4-year-old group while not affecting the performance of the 9- and 10-year-olds. The 3- and 4-year-olds in the active condition, however, were still significantly less accurate than the older children, despite their experience of self-directed exploration. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that self-directed activity serves to increase attention of preoperational children to relevant topological cues in the environment, whereas concrete operational children, due to their knowledge of projective and Euclidean space, demonstrate increased capacity to efficiently encode spatial information regardless of the mode of exploration.",,,,,Not sure: relocation of an object does not seem a perceptual task.

Active and passive spatial learning in human navigation: Acquisition of graph knowledge,13,"It is known that active exploration of a new environment leads to better spatial learning than does passive visual exposure. We ask whether specific components of active learning differentially contribute to particular forms of spatial knowledge-the exploration-specific learning hypothesis. Previously, we found that idiothetic information during walking is the primary active contributor to metric survey knowledge (Chrastil & Warren, 2013). In this study, we test the contributions of 3 components to topological graph and route knowledge: visual information, idiothetic information, and cognitive decision making. Four groups of participants learned the locations of 8 objects in a virtual hedge maze by (a) walking or (b) watching a video, crossed with (1) either making decisions about their path or (2) being guided through the maze. Route and graph knowledge were assessed by walking in the maze corridors from a starting object to the remembered location of a test object, with frequent detours. Decision making during exploration significantly contributed to subsequent route finding in the walking condition, whereas idiothetic information did not. Participants took novel routes and the metrically shortest routes on the majority of both direct and barrier trials, indicating that labeled graph knowledge-not merely route knowledge-was acquired. We conclude that, consistent with the exploration-specific learning hypothesis, decision making is the primary component of active learning for the acquisition of topological graph knowledge, whereas idiothetic information is the primary component for metric survey knowledge.",,,,,Same as in 26,it is about decision making but might include something of interest,,10.1037/xlm0000082

Motor commands in children interfere with their haptic perception of objects,17,"Neural processes of sensory-motor- and motor-sensory integration link perception and action, forming the basis for human interaction with the environment. Haptic perception, the ability to extract object features through action, is based on these processes. To study the development of motor-sensory integration, children judged the curvature of virtual objects after exploring them actively or while guided passively by a robot. Haptic acuity reached adult levels only at early adolescence. Unlike in adults, haptic precision in children was consistently lower during active exploration when compared to passive motion. Thus, the exploratory movements themselves constitute a form of noise for the developing haptic system that younger brains cannot compensate until mid-adolescence. Computationally, this is consistent with a noisy efference copy mechanism producing imprecise predicted sensory feedback, which compromises haptic precision in children, while the mature mechanism aids the adult brain to account for the effect of self-generated motion on perception. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,"""children judged the curvature of virtual objects after exploring them actively or while guided passively by a robot.

Early vestibular processing does not discriminate active from passive self-motion if there is a discrepancy between predicted and actual proprioceptive feedback,79,"Most of our sensory experiences are gained by active exploration of the world. While the ability to distinguish sensory inputs resulting of our own actions (termed reafference) from those produced externally (termed exafference) is well established, the neural mechanisms underlying this distinction are not fully understood. We have previously proposed that vestibular signals arising from self-generated movements are inhibited by a mechanism that compares the internal prediction of the proprioceptive consequences of self-motion to the actual feedback. Here we directly tested this proposal by recording from single neurons in monkey during vestibular stimulation that was externally produced and/or self-generated. We show for the first time that vestibular reafference is equivalently canceled for self-generated sensory stimulation produced by activation of the neck musculature (head-on-body motion), or axial musculature (combined head and body motion), when there is no discrepancy between the predicted and actual proprioceptive consequences of self-motion. However, if a discrepancy does exist, central vestibular neurons no longer preferentially encode vestibular exafference. Specifically, when simultaneous active and passive motion resulted in activation of the same muscle proprioceptors, neurons robustly encoded the total vestibular input (i.e., responses to vestibular reafference and exafference were equally strong), rather than exafference alone. Taken together, our results show that the cancellation of vestibular reafference in early vestibular processing requires an explicit match between expected and actual proprioceptive feedback. We propose that this vital neuronal computation, necessary for both accurate sensory perception and motor control, has important implications for a variety of sensory systems that suppress self-generated signals. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.",,,,,,only neural data,not tied to perception,10.1152/jn.00600.2013
Haptic discrimination of object shape in humans: Two-dimensional angle discrimination,19,"The human ability to recognize objects on the basis of their shape, as defined by active exploratory movements, is dependent on sensory feedback from mechanoreceptors located both in the skin and in deep structures (haptic feedback). Surprisingly, we have little information about the mechanisms for integrating these different signals into a single sensory percept. With the eventual aim of studying the underlying central neural mechanisms, we developed a shape discrimination test that required active exploration of objects, but was restricted to one component of shape, two-dimensional (2D) angles. The angles were machined from 1-cm-thick Plexiglas, and consisted of two 8-cm-long arms that met to form an angle of 90° (standard) or 91° to 103° (comparison angles). Subjects scanned pairs of angles with the index finger of the outstretched arm and identified the larger angle of each pair explored. Discrimination threshold (75% correct) was 4.7° (range 0.7° to 12.1°), giving a precision of 5.2% (0.8-13.4%: difference/standard). Repeated blocks of trials, either in the same session or on different days, had no effect on discrimination threshold. In contrast, the motor strategy was partly modified: scanning speed increased but dwell-time at the intersection did not change. Finally, 2D angle discrimination was not significantly modified by rotating the orientation of one of the angles in the pair (0°, 4° or 8° rotation towards the midline, in the vertical plane), providing evidence that subjects evaluated each angle independently in each trial. Subject reports indicated that they relied on cutaneous feedback from the exploring digit (amount of compression of the finger at the angle) and mental images of the angles, most likely arising from proprioceptive information (from the shoulder) generated during the to-and-fro scans over the angle. In terms of shoulder angles, the mean discrimination threshold here was 0.54° (range 0.08° to 1.36°). These values are lower than previous estimates of position sense at the shoulder. In light of the subjects' strategies, it therefore seems likely that both cutaneous and proprioceptive (including both dynamic and static position-related signals) feedback contributed to the haptic discrimination of 2D angles.",,,,,,"""Subjects scanned pairs of angles with the index finger of the outstretched arm and identified the larger angle of each pair explored.

Active tactile exploration with uncertainty and travel cost for fast shape estimation of unknown objects,80,"In this paper, active tactile exploration for object shape estimation is explored. A prior work suggested to touch the most uncertain part of the estimated shape for minimizing the required number of touches. In this paper, it is pointed out that it may not be the best approach for fast estimation. We propose a novel criterion in active touch point selection for fast estimation, which considers both uncertainty of shape estimation and travel cost to touch. Our method employs a Gaussian process implicit surface model to learn the object shape from tactile information, which allows us to evaluate the uncertainty of the shape estimation with an analytic form. To estimate the travel costs for all the touch candidates, our method utilizes a computationally-efficient graph-based path planning method based on stochastic optimal control theory. Simulations with 2D and 3D objects and real-robot experiments with a 7DOF robot arm and a single finger device equipped with a tactile sensor are conducted. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method for fast tactile object shape estimation as compared to passive exploration and active exploration that touches the most uncertain part of the estimated shape.",,,,,,simulations with robots,,10.1016/j.robot.2017.01.014
Dynamic Control of Robot Perception Using Stochastic Spatial Models,81,"Robot perception has traditionally been addressed as a passive and incidental activity, rather than an active and task-directed activity. Consequently, although sensor systems are essential to provide the information required by the decision-making and actuation components of a robot system, no explicit planning and control of the sensory activities of the robot is performed. This has lead to the development of sensor modules that are either excessively specialized, or inefficient and unfocused in their informational output. In this paper, we develop strategies for the dynamic control of robot perception, using stochastic sensor and spatial models to explicitly plan and control the sensory activities of an autonomous mobile robot, and to dynamically servo the robot and its sensors to acquire the information necessary for successful execution of robot tasks. We discuss the explicit characterization of robot task-specific information requirements, the use of information-theoretic measures to model the extent, accuracy and complexity of the robot’s world model, and the representation of inferences about the robot’s environment using the Inference Grid, a multi- property tesselated random field model. We describe the use of stochastic sensor models to determine the utility of sensory actions, and to compute the loci of observation of relevant information. These models allow the development of various perception control strategies, including attention control and focussing, perceptual responsiveness to varying spatial complexity, and control of multi-goal perceptual activities. We illustrate these methodologies using an autonomous multi-sensor mobile robot, and show the application of dynamic perception strategies to active exploration and multi-objective motion planning.",,,,,,,,10.1007/978-3-662-07896-9_6
Both stiff and compliant: Morphological and biomechanical adaptations of stick insect antennae for tactile exploration,82,"Active tactile exploration behaviour is constrained to a large extent by the morphological and biomechanical properties of the animal's somatosensory system. In the model organism Carausius morosus, the main tactile sensory organs are long, thin, seemingly delicate, but very robust antennae. Previous studies have shown that these antennae are compliant under contact, yet stiff enough to maintain a straight shape during active exploration. Overcritical damping of the flagellum, on the other hand, allows for a rapid return to the straight shape after release of contact. Which roles do the morphological and biomechanical adaptations of the flagellum play in determining these special mechanical properties? To investigate this question, we used a combination of biomechanical experiments and numerical modelling. A set of four finite-element (FE) model variants was derived to investigate the effect of the distinct geometrical and material properties of the flagellum on its static (bending) and dynamic (damping) characteristics. The results of our numerical simulations show that the tapered shape of the flagellum had the strongest influence on its static biomechanical behaviour. The annulated structure and thickness gradient affected the deformability of the flagellum to a lesser degree. The inner endocuticle layer of the flagellum was confirmed to be essential for explaining the strongly damped return behaviour of the antenna. By highlighting the significance of two out of the four main structural features of the insect flagellum, our study provides a basis for mechanical design of biomimetic touch sensors tuned to become maximally flexible while quickly resuming a straight shape after contact.",,,,,,simulations,,10.1098/rsif.2018.0246
Psychophysical evaluation of a low density and portable tactile device displaying small-scale surface features,22,"This work evaluates the haptic rendering capabilities of a low density and portable tactile device displaying small-scale surface features, such as ridge patterns and sinusoidal gratings. Psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate and compare JND's for distance, angle and wavelength perception of virtual and real surface features. Velocity was monitored during the active exploration of ridges and controlled during the passive-guided exploration of gratings. JND's found for the virtual surfaces are 22%, 12.6% and 13.3% of the standard stimuli (4.2mm, 45° and 5.09mm). JND's for real surfaces indicate that subjects' discrimination ability using the tactile device decreases roughly 65%. Results provide insight of the sensory resolution associated with the tactile device which can guide the development of an improved device, suitable applications and effective tactile rendering methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",14.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1f035a7ffa94388a5e5d414ee7bee9e6/fdfc29d3/14.pdf),,,,the aim is testing the display,,no comparison between active and passive,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14075-4_8
A Robotic Perceptual System Utilizing Passive Vision and Active Touch,83,"This paper presents a robotic perceptual system which utilizes passive vision and active touch. The task is one-fingered exploration of a single unmodeled object for apprehension— the determination of the features of the object and the rela tions among them. A two-stage exploration is utilized. Vision is first used in a feedforward manner to segment the object and to obtain its position. Touch is then used in a feedback mode to further explore the object. In designing this system, we have addressed several issues. The first concerns the way in which the robotic perceptual system should be structured. The model which we propose here is based upon theories of human perception. It consists of a highly modularized set of knowledge-based modules, each of which is domain specific and informationally encapsulated. Within the framework of this model, we have designed both vision and touch subsys tems. In each case, we have defined the primitives, features, and representations extracted and created by the system. The visual system is passive and relatively simple. The touch system is active and is an attempt to systematically structure a robotic haptic perception system. Finally, we have ad dressed the issues of how these two subsystems interact dur ing active exploration and how the information from each is integrated. The work described has been implemented and tested on a robot system consisting of a combination tactile array/force-torque sensor, a PUMA robot arm, a pair of CCD cameras, and a Vax 750. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Cognitive load can explain differences in active and passive touch,23,"Active touch is often described as yielding ""better-quality"" information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",15.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/adede59b58d088936fbea4eb0e2c64d1/a2d61ed1/15.pdf),,,,Check if they have behavioral data No BEhavioral Data,"""Post-scanning questioning provided participants with the

O papel da experiência motora no desenvolvimento global: as implicações na criança com paralisia cerebral,84,"Resumo A influência da atividade motora e da manipulação na aprendizagem global tem sido suportada pela perspetiva de que o movimento ativo é importante para o desenvolvimento percetivo típico, não podendo ser substituído por movimentos passivos. Por outro lado, considera-se que a atividade psicomotora potencia a internalização do movimento e a relação do corpo com o espaço. Assim, a aprendizagem humana e a conquista de estádios de desenvolvimento surgirá como resultado da experiência motora, posteriormente reforçada na organização cerebral pela experiência reflexiva. No entanto, nem todas as crianças cumprem as etapas de desenvolvimento psicomotor nos períodos típicos. Quando a questão se coloca face a crianças em desvantagem, nomeadamente com necessidades educativas especiais de caráter motor, como é o caso da paralisia cerebral, a tónica pode ganhar expressão particular. As experiências psicomotoras e sociais são, por vezes, barradas por condicionantes que privam as crianças de vivências que ocorrem de forma autónoma e espontânea, tipicamente, resultantes do desenvolvimento global. No presente texto, atravessaremos uma revisão de estudos que trazem evidências no domínio da influência da experiência motora no desenvolvimento e na aprendizagem, nomeadamente do papel da exploração ativa em idades precoces. Esta abordagem e a sua discussão, com ênfase na implicação na aprendizagem e desenvolvimento de crianças com necessidades educativas especiais de caráter motor, com destaque para a Martins, Catarina (2013).

Abstract The influence of motor activity and manipulation on the global learning has been supported by the perspective that active movement is vital to typical visuomotor and perceptual development and that it cannot be replaced by passive movements. Moreover, it is also considered that motor experience enables psychomotor development, the internalization of the body in space and the conquest of development stages. Thus, human learning emerges as the result of motor experience, later reinforced in the brain organization by reflective experience. However, not all children comply with the stages of psychomotor development in typical periods. When the issue arises regarding disadvantaged children, in particular, children with special educational needs as is the case of children with cerebral palsy, the focus can gain higher relevance. Motor and social experiences are sometimes blocked out by conditions that deprive children of experiences that are typically experienced autonomously and spontaneously. In this text, we will cross a review of major studies that provide evidence within the area of influence of motor experience on development and learning. What is the role of active exploration at early ages? To what extent does the motor action underlie perception? The discussion of this issue with focus on implications in learning and development of children with special educational needs, with an emphasis on cerebral palsy, are some of the topics that underlie this paper.",,,,,Portuguese,review,non-English review article on the topic,
Active visual object exploration and recognition with an unmanned aerial vehicle,85,"In this paper, an active control method for visual object exploration and recognition with an unmanned aerial vehicle is presented. This work uses a convolutional neural network for visual object recognition, where input images are obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle from multiple objects. The object recognition task is an iterative process actively controlled by a saliency map module, which extracts interesting object regions for exploration. The active control allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to autonomously explore better object regions to improve the recognition accuracy. The iterative exploration task stops when the probability from the convolutional neural network exceeds a decision threshold. The active control is validated with offline and real-time experiments for visual exploration and recognition of five objects. Furthermore, passive exploration is also tested for performance comparison. Experiments show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable to autonomously explore interesting object regions. Results also show an improvement in recognition accuracy from 88.14% to 95.66% for passive and active exploration, respectively. Overall, this work offers a framework to allow robots to autonomously decide where to move and look next, to improve the performance during a visual object exploration and recognition task.",,,,,,,,10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851738
A Novel Treadmill with a Function of Simulating Walkway-Walking,26,"There are differences between walkway walking and walking on a treadmill. It is considered that these differences are based on the fact that the walking on the treadmill is a passive motion, while the walkway walking is an active motion. The differences in walking between on a floor and on a treadmill are investigated using the electromyograph and on the oral questionnaires from subjects. The obtained knowledge is as follows. (1) The muscular activity of the legs in walking on the treadmill without the tractive force is smaller than that in walking on the floor. (2) The walking on the treadmill with 60% of the tractive force being equivalent to the walkway walking from the rear downward of 30 degrees becomes similar to the usual walking on the floor. This paper proposes a novel treadmill with a function of simulating walkway-walking. The developed treadmill has a walking-load device towing the subject from the rear downward and controlling the walking speed according to the position of subject on the treadmill. The verification experiment of walking on the developed treadmill shows the availability to gait training and rehabilitation. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The protective effec of continuous passive motion on living articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis: An experimental investigation in the rabbit,86,"A review of the literature on the pathogenesis of the destruction of articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis in humans presents a paradox in treatment by complete rest and intermittent active motion in its management. The paradox is resolved by observations on an experimental acute staphylococcal septic arthritis of the knee joint in adolescent rabbits. Twenty-four hours after the intra-articular injection of Staphylococcus aureus, the infected joints were surgically drained and the rabbits were treated by penicillin. During the first two weeks the involved knee joints of 51 rabbits were managed by one of the following three methods: Series I-immobilization (cast); Series II-intermittent active motion (cage activity); Series III-continuous passive motion. At the end of two weeks all rabbits were permitted normal cage activity until the time of sacrifice. The methods of assessment of the articular cartilage of the involved joints included lateral radiographs, gross examination, microscopic examination (including histochemistry), and biochemical determinations of the percent composition of collagen, keratin sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. A scoring system was developed to assess the articular cartilage in relation to cellularity, loss of matrix, cloning of chondrocytes, adhesions (pannus), and orthochromasia (with safranin-O). The rabbits in Series III tolerated continuous passive motion of their infected joints well; they appeared to be comfortable, slept and ate well, and continued to gain weight. Assessment of 28 involved joints after ten weeks revealed that continuous passive motion for two weeks had a striking and statistically significant protective effect on preventing progressive degeneration to the effects of either immobilization or intermittent active motion. In the knee joints of the animals managed by continuous passive motion there were fewer radiographic abnormalities, erosions, and osteophytes; less loss of cellularity and matrix; less cloning of chondrocytes; fewer adhesions (pannus); better orthochromasia with safranin-O; and more normal content of collagen, keratin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, and total hexosamine than in the knee joints of those rabbits managed either by immobilization or by intermittent active motion. Possible explanations of the protective effect of continuous passive motion the articular cartilage in an experimental model of acute septic arthritis include: (1) the prevention of adhesions (pannus); (2) the improvement of nutrition of the cartilage through increased diffusion of synovial fluid; (3) the enhancement of clearance of lysosomal enzymes and purulent exudate from the infected joint; and (4) the stimulation of living chondrocytes to synthesize the various components of the matrix. In the experimental model of septic arthritis neither immobilization nor intermittent active motion protected the articular cartilage from progressive degeneration. The concept of continuous passive motion may be applicable to the clinical management of acute septic arthritis in the human in combination with early surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.",,,,,,,,
Comparison of active and passive reduction-test methods on discrimination of ankle joint angle of patients with functional ankle instability,27,"[Purpose] To examine the differences in joint position sense (JPS) test methods in patients with functional ankle instability (FAI). [Subjects] The subjects were seventeen patients with FAI and 29 healthy men. [Methods] The subjects were examined using active and passive reduction methods. Targets were located at eight specified angles. Constant errors and absolute errors were used as measurement indicators. [Results] In the active motion test no trend was observed with a change in target angle between the FAI and healthy groups. On the other hand, in the passive motion test the FAI group showed a significant increase in overshoot toward dorsiflexion with higher plantar flexion angles than the healthy group. [Conclusion] In the active motion test, there was less error in the ankle joint position sense because of the effects of the muscle contraction, but in the passive motion test there was a greater tendency of error when the ankle was in plantar flexion.",,,,,,"might be interesting, talks about joint position ",,10.1589/rika.26.557
The Compass Elbow Hinge: Indications and initial results,87,"The Compass Elbow Hinge uses Illizarov's methods of fixation to externally hold the elbow reduced and allow both passive and active motion.

One was lost to follow-up. Patients with degenerative changes underwent fascia lata interposition while those treated for contractures underwent anterior and posterior capsular release with or without fascia lata interposition. Those with elbow instability underwent ligament reconstruction. The device was removed after 6 weeks and seven of the 11 patients were satisfied with the outcome of the operation. Stability could not be achieved in two patients with coronoid fractures that were not reconstructed. One patient did not tolerate the device and requested its removal with subsequent subluxation.

Adaptive fuzzy torque control of passive torque servo systems based on small gain theorem and input-to-state stability,88,"Passive torque servo system (PTSS) simulates aerodynamic load and exerts the load on actuation system, but PTSS endures position coupling disturbance from active motion of actuation system, and this inherent disturbance is called extra torque. The most important issue for PTSS controller design is how to eliminate the influence of extra torque. Using backstepping technique, adaptive fuzzy torque control (AFTC) algorithm is proposed for PTSS in this paper, which reflects the essential characteristics of PTSS and guarantees transient tracking performance as well as final tracking accuracy. Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy logic system is utilized to compensate parametric uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties. The output velocity of actuator identified model is introduced into AFTC aiming to eliminate extra torque. The closed-loop stability is studied using small gain theorem and the control system is proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed AFTC algorithm is applied to an electric load simulator (ELS), and the comparative experimental results indicate that AFTC controller is effective for PTSS. © 2012 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.",,,,,,simulation,,10.1016/S1000-9361(11)60461-5

Hand transplant still remains a partly experimental procedure because of the small number of patients and short follow-up (not longer than 10 years). Most hand transplantations have been performed at the distal forearm level. Material and method. The transplant recipient was a 29-year-old man who had lost his dominant right hand 3 years before in a milling machine accident; the donor was a 52-year-old woman. The procurement and transport of the limb were performed according to standard procedures. Preparation of the donor limb and the patient's stump was performed simultaneously by two surgical teams. Anastomoses were done in the following order : bones-tendons-nerves-veins- artery. The radial artery and 3 large veins were anastomosed. The operative wound was closed without a skin graft. Ischemia time was 9 hours. Pharmacological treatment was similar to that usually administered to replantation patients; immunotherapy consisted of Simulect, Prograf, Cell-Cept, and steroids. Physiotherapy was started on the second postoperative day; it consisted of early protective active motion (EPM), continuous passive motion (CPM), splinting, and sensory stimulation. The function of internal organs was monitored; the early outcome was evaluated at 6 months after the transplantation. Results. The function of internal organs remained undisturbed, no rejection episodes were observed. Bony union was achieved after 11 weeks and progressed steadily, as did the range of motion and reinnervation. On the day of the preliminary assessment, the active range of motion was 200°, 2PD exceeded 15 mm, and electromyography demonstrated temperature sensation and hypothenar muscle function. Functional assessment according to the DASH questionnaire was rated at 67 points, and a quality of life evaluation with the SF-36 questionnaire produced a score of 110 points. Conclusion.

Respiratory motion-management in stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung cancer – A dosimetric comparison in an anthropomorphic lung phantom (LuCa),91,"Background and purpose The objective of this study was to compare the latest respiratory motion-management strategies, namely the internal-target-volume (ITV) concept, the mid-ventilation (MidV) principle, respiratory gating and dynamic couch tracking. Materials and methods An anthropomorphic, deformable and dynamic lung phantom was used for the dosimetric validation of these techniques. Stereotactic treatments were adapted to match the techniques and five distinct respiration patterns, and delivered to the phantom while radiographic film measurements were taken inside the tumor. To report on tumor coverage, these dose distributions were used to calculate mean doses (Dmean), changes in homogeneity indices (ΔH2-98), gamma agreement, and areas covered by the planned minimum dose (A>Dmin). Results All techniques achieved good tumor coverage (A>Dmin > 99.0%) and minor changes in Dmean (±3.2%). Gating and tracking strategies showed superior results in gamma agreement and ΔH2-98 compared to ITV and MidV concepts, which seem to be more influenced by the interplay and the gradient effect. For lung, heart and spinal cord, significant dose differences between the four techniques were found (p < 0.05), with lowest doses for gating and tracking strategies.

Active hair bundle movements in auditory hair cells Mechanoelectrical transduction and adaptation,93,"The frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing depends on not only the passive mechanics of the basilar membrane but also an active amplification of the mechanical stimulus by the cochlear hair cells. The common view is that amplification stems from the somatic motility of the outer hair cells (OHCs), changes in their length impelled by voltage-dependent transitions in the membrane protein prestin. Whether this voltage-controlled mechanism, whose frequency range may be limited by the membrane time constant, has the band width to cover the entire auditory range of mammals is uncertain. However, there is ample evidence for an alternative mode of force generation by hair cells of non-mammals, such as frogs and turtles, which probably lack prestin. The latter process involves active motion of the hair bundle underpinned by conformational changes in the mechanotransducer (MT) channels and activation of one or more isoforms of myosin. This review summarizes evidence for active hair bundle motion and its connection to MT channel adaptation. Key factors for the hair bundle motor to play a role in the mammalian cochlea include the size and speed of force production.",,,,,,,,10.1113/jphysiol.2006.115949
Direct and reversed dorsal digital island flaps: a review of 65 cases,94,"BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of soft tissue defects in fingers continues to be a challenging problem. The purpose of this study is to report the reconstruction of small-to-moderate defects of fingers with dorsal digital island flap (DDIF) and to evaluate the efficacy of use of the flap.
METHODS: Over last six years, a retrospective study was conducted with 65 patients who had soft tissue defects of fingers treated with the DDIF. Sixty-nine soft-tissue defects were found in 69 fingers in 65 patients. Based on the flow direction of blood supply, the patients were divided into two groups: the direct (n=35) and reversed (n=30) DDIF groups. In addition, based on the different donor sites, the direct DDIF group was divided into two subgroups: the proximal phalangeal direct DDIF subgroup (n=16) and the extended pedicle direct DDIF subgroup (n=19). The main outcomes were static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of flap and joint motion.
RESULTS: At the final follow-up, the mean static two-point discrimination of the flaps was 9.7mm (range, 8 to 12mm) in the proximal phalangeal direct DDIF subgroup and 8.3mm (range, 7 to 11mm) in the extended pedicle direct DDIF subgroup, with a significant difference (p=0.005). In the direct DDIF group, there was no significant difference in total active motion between the donor fingers and the opposite sides. In the reversed DDIF group, the mean total active motion of the donor fingers was 170° and the data of the opposite sides was 181°, with a significant difference (p=0.024). Maximum amplitude losses of 15° were seen in 12% of patients in the distal interphalangeal joint.
CONCLUSIONS: The DDIF is reliable and technically easy for reconstructing small-to-moderate defects of fingers. The extended pedicle direct DDIF may be an optional solution when sensory reconstruction is needed.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.injury.2014.08.030
Analysis and Synthesis of Underactuated Compliant Mechanisms Based on Transmission Properties of Motion and Force,95,"This article analyzes and designs the transmission structure for underactuated compliant mechanisms (UCMs). The transmission structure of UCMs consists of serial and parallel transmission chains. At first, the UCMs are classified systematically according to the number and distribution of the serial and parallel transmissions. Next, the active and passive transmission properties of motion and force in UCMs are analyzed on the defined four subspaces of tangent and cotangent spaces of joint space. Synthesizing the classification and the transmission properties of UCMs, the congruent relationship between mechanical structure and transmission function is established, and different cases of UCMs are discussed and compared. A novel type of UCMs can achieve the independent regulation of passive stiffness, active force, and active motion that is useful for improving the transmission performance in robotic and prosthetic hands. Finally, a functional oriented design method is proposed and used to design a single-actuator two-fingered gripper for enveloping and precision grasps.

Repetitive TMS of the somatosensory cortex improves writer's cramp and enhances cortical activity,96,"OBJECTIVE: Since the somatosensory system is believed to be affected in focal dystonia, we focused on the modulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to improve symptoms of writers cramp. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with writer's cramp (N=9 in the pilot study and N=11 in the advanced study) were treated with 30-minute 1 Hz real- or sham-rTMS of the SI cortex every day for 5 days. Before and after rTMS, 1.5 T fMRI was examined during simple hand movements. While in the pilot study the rTMS coil was navigated over the SI cortex with a maximum of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal induced by passive movement, patients in the advanced study had the coil above the postcentral sulcus. RESULTS: After real-rTMS, 4 pilot study patients and 10 advanced study patients experienced subjective and objective improvement in writing, while only minimal changes were observed after sham-rTMS. Patients involved in the active movement task exhibited a rTMS-induced BOLD signal increase bilaterally in the SI cortex, posterior parietal cortex and in the supplementary motor area (p<0.001 corrected). After sham-rTMS, no BOLD signal changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1 Hz rTMS of the SI cortex can improve writer's cramp while increasing the cortical activity in both hemispheres. Handwriting improved in most patients, as well as the subjective benefit, and lasted for 2-3 weeks. The beneficial effects of rTMS paralleled the functional reorganization in the SI cortex and connected areas, reflecting the impact of somatosensory system on active motion control. ©2010 Neuroendocrinology Letters.",,,,,,,,
A unified internal model theory to resolve the paradox of active versus passive self-motion sensation,97,"Brainstem and cerebellar neurons implement an internal model to accurately estimate self-motion during externally generated (‘passive’) movements. However, these neurons show reduced responses during self-generated (‘active’) movements, indicating that predicted sensory consequences of motor commands cancel sensory signals. Remarkably, the computational processes underlying sensory prediction during active motion and their relationship to internal model computations during passive movements remain unknown. We construct a Kalman filter that incorporates motor commands into a previously established model of optimal passive self-motion estimation. The simulated sensory error and feedback signals match experimentally measured neuronal responses during active and passive head and trunk rotations and translations. We conclude that a single sensory internal model can combine motor commands with vestibular and proprioceptive signals optimally. Thus, although neurons carrying sensory prediction error or feedback signals show attenuated modulation, the sensory cues and internal model are both engaged and critically important for accurate self-motion estimation during active head movements.",,,,,,,,10.7554/eLife.28074
Effective motion learning for a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling,98,"We propose a method for realizing effective dynamic motion learning in a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling. Flexible-joint robots have recently attracted attention because of their adaptiveness, safety, and, in particular, dynamic motions. It is difficult to control robots that require dynamic motion. In past studies, attractors and oscillators were designed as motion primitives of an assumed task in advance. However, it is difficult to adapt to unintended environmental changes using such methods. To overcome this problem, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) that does not require predetermined parameters. In this research, we propose a method for facilitating effective learning. First, a robot learns simple motions via motor babbling, acquiring body dynamics using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Motor babbling is the process of movement that infants use to acquire their own body dynamics during their early days. Next, the robot learns additional motions required for a target task using the acquired body dynamics. For acquiring these body dynamics, the robot uses motor babbling with its redundant flexible joints to learn motion primitives. This redundancy implies that there are numerous possible motion patterns. In comparison to a basic learning task, the motion primitives are simply modified to adjust to the task. Next, we focus on the types of motions used in motor babbling. We classify the motions into two motion types, passive motion and active motion. Passive motion involves inertia without any torque input, whereas active motion involves a torque input. The robot acquires body dynamics from the passive motion and a means of torque generation from the active motion. As a result, we demonstrate the importance of performing prior learning via motor babbling before learning a task. In addition, task learning is made more efficient by dividing the motion into two types of motor babbling patterns.",,,,,,,,10.1109/IROS.2015.7353750
Internal models of self-motion: Computations that suppress vestibular reafference in early vestibular processing,99,"In everyday life, vestibular sensors are activated by both self-generated and externally applied head movements. The ability to distinguish inputs that are a consequence of our own actions (i.e., active motion) from those that result from changes in the external world (i.e., passive or unexpected motion) is essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. Recent work has made progress toward understanding how the brain distinguishes between these two kinds of sensory inputs. We have performed a series of experiments in which single-unit recordings were made from vestibular afferents and central neurons in alert macaque monkeys during rotation and translation. Vestibular afferents showed no differences in firing variability or sensitivity during active movements when compared to passive movements. In contrast, the analyses of neuronal firing rates revealed that neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing (i.e., in the vestibular nuclei) were effectively less sensitive to active motion. Notably, however, this ability to distinguish between active and passive motion was not a general feature of early central processing, but rather was a characteristic of a distinct group of neurons known to contribute to postural control and spatial orientation. Our most recent studies have addressed how vestibular and proprioceptive inputs are integrated in the vestibular cerebellum, a region likely to be involved in generating an internal model of self-motion. We propose that this multimodal integration within the vestibular cerebellum is required for eliminating self-generated vestibular information from the subsequent computation of orientation and posture control at the first central stage of processing. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,only neural data,,10.1007/s00221-011-2555-9
Multimodal integration of self-motion cues in the vestibular system: Active versus passive translations,100,"The ability to keep track of where we are going as we navigate through our environment requires knowledge of our ongoing location and orientation. In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion. © 2013 the authors.",,,,,,,"not related to perception, mechanism of distinguishing passive from active self-motion",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3051-13.2013
Modality-specific and amodal aspects of object perception in infancy: The case of active touch,29,"Three experiments investigated 4.5-month-old infants' perception of the unity and boundaries of haptically presented objects. When infants actively explored the two handles of an unseen object assembly, perception of the unity of the assembly depended on the handles' motion. Infants perceived a single, connected object if the handles moved rigidly together, and they perceived two distinct objects if the handles underwent relative vertical or horizontal motion. When infants passively explored the same object assembly undergoing the same motions, object perception appeared to be indeterminate. The findings of the active motion experiments accord with the findings of studies of visual object perception and suggest that object perception depends on amodal processes, operating on representations of either seen or felt surface motions. The findings of the passive motion experiments nevertheless suggest a difference between visual and haptic perception: for infants as for adults, haptic perception is enhanced by the active production of surface motion. © 1993.",,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(93)90051-V
Anterior cruciate ligament-deficient patients with passive knee joint laxity have a decreased range of anterior-posterior motion during active movements,101,"Background: Although instability of the knee joint is known to modify gait patterns, the amount that patients compensate for joint laxity during active movements remains unknown. Purpose: By developing a novel technique to allow the assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics, this study aimed to elucidate the role of passive joint laxity on active tibiofemoral kinematics during walking. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Using motion capture, together with combinations of advanced techniques for assessing skeletal kinematics (including the symmetrical axis of rotation approach [SARA], symmetrical center of rotation estimation [SCoRE], and optimal common shape technique [OCST]), a novel noninvasive approach to evaluate dynamic tibiofemoral motion was demonstrated as both reproducible and repeatable. Passive and active anterior-posterior translations of the tibiofemoral joint were then examined in 13 patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures that were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and compared with those in their healthy contralateral limbs. Results: Passive tibial anterior translation was significantly greater in the ACL-ruptured knees than in the contralateral healthy controls. However, the femora of the ACL-ruptured knees generally remained more posterior (∼3 mm) relative to the tibia within a gait cycle of walking compared with the healthy limbs. Surprisingly, the mean range of tibiofemoral anterior-posterior translation over an entire gait cycle was significantly lower in ACL-ruptured knees than in the healthy joints (P = .026). A positive correlation was detected between passive laxity and active joint mobility, but with a consistent reduction in the range of tibiofemoral anteriorposterior translation of approximately 3 mm in the ACL-deficient knees. Conclusion: It seems that either active stabilization of tibiofemoral kinematics or anterior subluxation of the tibia reduces joint translation in lax knees. This implies that either a muscular overcompensation mechanism or a physical limitation due to secondary passive stabilizers occurs within the joint and thus produces a situation that has a reduced range of active motion compared with knees with physiological stability. Clinical Relevance: The reduced range of active tibiofemoral translation suggests overloading of the passive structures in passively lax knees, either through excessive muscular action or joint subluxation, and could provide a plausible mechanism for explaining posttraumatic degeneration of cartilage in the joint. © 2013 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,10.1177/0363546513480465
"Flexor tendon injuries of hand: experience at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan.",102,"BACKGROUND: Flexor tendon injury is one of the most common hand injuries. This initial treatment is of the utmost importance because it often determines the final outcome; inadequate primary treatment is likely to give poor long tem results. Various suture techniques have been devised for tendon repair but the modified Kessler's technique is the most commonly used. This study was conducted in order to know the cause, mechanism and the effects of early controlled mobilization after flexor tendon repair and to assess the range of active motion after flexor tendon repair in hand. METHODS: This study was conducted at the department of Plastic Surgery, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad from 1st March 2002 to 31st August 2003. Only adult patients of either sex with an acute injury were included in whom primary or delayed primary tendon repair was undertaken. In all the patients, modified Kessler's technique was used for the repair using non-absorbable monofilament (Prolene 4-0). The wound was closed with interrupted non-absorbable, polyfilament (Silk 4-0) suture. A dorsal splint extending beyond the finger tip to proximal forearm was used with wrist in 20-30 degrees palmer flexion, metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint flexed at 60 degrees. Passive movements of fingers were started from the first post operative day, and for controlled, active movements, a dynamic splint was applied. RESULTS: During this study, 33 patients with 39 digits were studies. 94% of the patients had right dominated hand involvement. 51% had the complete flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) injuries. Middle and ring fingers were most commonly involved. Thumb was involved in 9% of the patients. Zone III(46%) was the commonest to be involved followed by zone II (28%). Laceration with sharp object was the most frequent cause of injury. Finger tip to distal palmer crease distance (TPD) was < 2.0 cm in 71% cases (average 2.4cm) at the end of 2nd postoperative week. Total number of patients was 34 at the end of 6th week. TPD was < 2.0 cm in 55% patients and < 1.0 cm in 38% cases (average 1.5cm) at the end of 6th week. Total 9 patients were lost to the follow up at the end of 8th week. TPD was < 1.0 cm in 67% (average 0.9 cm) at the end of 8th postoperative week. No case of disruption of repair was noted during the study. CONCLUSION: Early active mobilization programme is essential after tendon repair. Majority of the patients (92%) had fair to good results at the end of 2nd week which increased to 97% at the end of 8th week to good to excellent.",,,,,,,,
The ventral posterior lateral thalamus preferentially encodes externally applied versus active movement: Implications for self-motion perception,30,"Successful interaction with our environment requires that voluntary behaviors be precisely coordinated with our perception of self-motion. The vestibular sensors in the inner ear detect self-motion and in turn send projections via the vestibular nuclei to multiple cortical areas through 2 principal thalamocortical pathways, 1 anterior and 1 posterior. While the anterior pathway has been extensively studied, the role of the posterior pathway is not well understood. Accordingly, here we recorded responses from individual neurons in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus of macaque monkeys during externally applied (passive) and actively generated self-motion. The sensory responses of neurons that robustly encoded passive rotations and translations were canceled during comparable voluntary movement (~80% reduction). Moreover, when both passive and active self-motion were experienced simultaneously, neurons selectively encoded the detailed time course of the passive component. To examine the mechanism underlying the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active motion, we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement. We found that suppression only occurred if the actual sensory consequences of motion matched the motor-based expectation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the posterior thalamocortical vestibular pathway selectively encodes unexpected motion, thereby providing a neural correlate for ensuring perceptual stability during active versus externally generated motion.",,,,,They could have behavioral data,"""we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement."" might be of interest?",,10.1093/cercor/bhx325
Active Vision for Tremor Disease Monitoring,103,"The aim of this work is to introduce a prototype for monitoring tremor diseases using computer vision techniques. While vision has been previously used for this purpose, the system we are introducing differs intrinsically from other traditional systems. The essential difference is characterized by the placement of the camera on the user's body rather than in front of it, and thus reversing the whole process of motion estimation. This is called active motion tracking. Active vision is simpler in setup and achieves more accurate results compared to traditional arrangements, which we refer to as “passive” here. One main advantage of active tracking is its ability to detect even tiny motions using its simple setup, and that makes it very suitable for monitoring tremor disorders.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.252
Flexor tendon excursion and load during passive and active simulated motion: A cadaver study,104,"The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of tendon excursion and load experienced during simulated active and passive rehabilitation exercises. Six cadaver specimens were utilized to examine tendon excursion and load. Lateral fluoroscopic images were used to measure the excursions of metal markers placed in the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons of the index, middle, and ring fingers. Measurements were performed during ten different passive and active simulated motions. Mean tendon forces were higher in all active versus passive movements. Blocking movements placed the highest loads on the flexor tendons. Active motion resulted in higher tendon excursion than did passive motion. Simulated hook position resulted in the highest total tendon excursion and the highest inter-tendinous excursion. This knowledge may help optimize the management of the post-operative exercise therapy regimen. © The Author(s) 2012.",,,,,,,,10.1177/1753193412469128
Ultrasonographic Assessment of Long Finger Tendon Excursion in Zone V During Passive and Active Tendon Gliding Exercises,105,"Purpose: Cadaver and in vivo studies report variable results for tendon excursion during active and passive hand movements. The purpose of this study was to measure long finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon excursion during active and passive movement using high-resolution ultrasound images. Methods: The FDP tendon excursion was measured at the wrist level in 10 healthy subjects during full tip-to-palm active and passive flexion of the fingers. Passive movement was performed 2 ways: (1) straight to full fist: passive flexion starting at the metacarpophalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joint flexion; and (2) hook to full fist: passive flexion starting at the distal interphalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion. Tendon excursion was measured using an in-house-developed, frame-to-frame analysis of high-resolution ultrasound images. Results: Median FDP excursion was 24.3 mm, 14.0 mm, and 13.6 mm for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Tendon excursions during active movements was significantly larger than excursions during passive movements (p = .005). The adjusted median tendon excursion was 12.7 mm/100°, 7.5 mm/100°, and 7.4 mm/100° for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Adjusted tendon excursions during active movement were significantly larger than those achieved during passive straight to full fist movement). Adjusted tendon excursions during straight to full fist movements were significantly larger than those achieved during passive hook to full fist movement. Conclusions: Active motion produced 74% and 79% increases in excursions compared to both passive motions in healthy controls. The study results can serve as a reference for evaluating excursions in patients with tendon pathology, including those who have had tendon repair and reconstruction. © 2010 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.jhsa.2010.01.010
Stretch-reflex threshold modulation during active elbow movements in post-stroke survivors with spasticity,106,"Objectives Voluntary movements post-stroke are affected by abnormal muscle activation due to exaggerated stretch reflexes (SRs). We examined the ability of post-stroke subjects to regulate SRs in spastic muscles. Methods Elbow flexor and extensor EMGs and joint angle were recorded in 13 subjects with chronic post-stroke spasticity. Muscles were either stretched passively (relaxed arm) or actively (antagonist contraction) at different velocities. Velocity-dependent SR thresholds were defined as angles where stretched muscle EMG exceeded 3SDs of baseline. Sensitivity of SRs to stretch velocity was defined as µ. The regression through thresholds was interpolated to zero velocity to obtain the tonic SR threshold (TSRT) angle. Results Compared to passive stretches, TSRTs during active motion occurred at longer muscle lengths (i.e., increased in flexors and decreased in extensors by 10–40°). Values of μ increased by 1.5–4.0. Changes in flexor TSRTs during active compared to passive stretches were correlated with clinical spasticity (r = −0.68) and arm motor impairment (r = 0.81). Conclusions Spasticity thresholds measured at rest were modulated during active movement. Arm motor impairments were related to the ability to modulate SR thresholds between the two states rather than to passive-state values. Significance Relationship between spasticity and movement disorders may be explained by deficits in SR threshold range of regulation and modifiability, representing a measure of stroke-related sensorimotor deficits.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.clinph.2017.07.411
Comparison of 2 analgesia modalities in total knee replacement surgery: Is there an effect on knee function rehabilitation?,107,"Background: We compared the effects of continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) and continuous intraarticular block (CIAB) on pain, functional recovery and adverse effects after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Material/Methods: We prospectively randomized 54 patients undergoing TKA into 2 groups: CFNB (Group F) and CIAB (Group I). Surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine, diclofenac, and acetaminophen for the first 72 h postoperatively. Pain was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS), 48-h morphine consumption and 72-h local anesthetic dosage were recorded, motor blockade was assessed, maximum range of motion (ROM) was measured, and adverse effect profiles were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference in postoperative pain at rest, in passive motion, active motion, or active movement (2-min walk test (2MWT)) between study groups. Group I had less opioid usage in the first 24 h postoperatively (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups in the postoperative local anesthetic dosage (p>0.05). Significantly lower scores of Bromage scale in Group I in 72 h after surgery (p<0.05) were found. Group I had superior passive maximum ROM in 1 month after surgery and superior active maximum ROM on day 7 and at 1 month after surgery (p<0.05). Conclusions: Both CFNB and CIAB are effective postoperative analgesia methods after TKA. CIAB leads to lower postoperative opioid usage in the first 24 h, lower motor blockade in the first 72 h, and better knee function on day 7 and at 1 month after surgery.",,,,,,,,10.12659/MSM.899320
Repetitive TMS of the somatosensory cortex improves writer ’ s cramp and improves writer ' s cramp and enhances cortical,108,"OBJECTIVE: Since the somatosensory system is believed to be affected in focal dystonia, we focused on the modulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to improve symptoms of writer’s cramp. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with writer’s cramp (N=9 in the pilot study and N=11 in the advanced study) were treated with 30-minute 1 Hz real- or sham- rTMS of the SI cortex every day for 5 days. Before and after rTMS, 1.5 T fMRI was examined during simple hand movements. While in the pilot study the rTMS coil was navigated over the SI cortex with a maximum of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal induced by passive movement, patients in the advanced study had the coil above the postcentral sulcus. RESULTS: After real-rTMS, 4 pilot study patients and 10 advanced study patients experienced subjective and objective improvement in writing, while only minimal changes were observed after sham-rTMS. Patients involved in the active move- ment task exhibited a rTMS-induced BOLD signal increase bilaterally in the SI cortex, posterior parietal cortex and in the supplementary motor area (p<0.001 corrected). After sham-rTMS, no BOLD signal changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1 Hz rTMS of the SI cortex can improve writer’s cramp while increasing the cortical activity in both hemispheres. Handwriting improved in most patients, as well as the subjective benefit, and lasted for 2–3 weeks. The ben- eficial effects of rTMS paralleled the functional reorganization in the SI cortex and connected areas, reflecting the impact of somatosensory system on active motion control. To",,,,,,,,
Plasticity of cerebellar purkinje cells in behavioral training of body balance control,109,"Neural responses to sensory inputs caused by self-generated movements (reafference) and external passive stimulation (exafference) differ in various brain regions. The ability to differentiate such sensory information can lead to movement execution with better accuracy. However, how sensory responses are adjusted in regard to this distinguishability during motor learning is still poorly understood. The cerebellum has been hypothesized to analyze the functional significance of sensory information during motor learning, and is thought to be a key region of reafference computation in the vestibular system. In this study, we investigated Purkinje cell (PC) spike trains as cerebellar cortical output when rats learned to balance on a suspended dowel. Rats progressively reduced the amplitude of body swing and made fewer foot slips during a 5-min balancing task. Both PC simple (SSs; 17 of 26) and complex spikes (CSs; 7 of 12) were found to code initially on the angle of the heads with respect to a fixed reference. Using periods with comparable degrees of movement, we found that such SS coding of information in most PCs (10 of 17) decreased rapidly during balance learning. In response to unexpected perturbations and under anesthesia, SS coding capability of these PCs recovered. By plotting SS and CS firing frequencies over 15-s time windows in double-logarithmic plots, a negative correlation between SS and CS was found in awake, but not anesthetized, rats. PCs with prominent SS coding attenuation during motor learning showed weaker SS-CS correlation. Hence, we demonstrate that neural plasticity for filtering out sensory reafference from active motion occurs in the cerebellar cortex in rats during balance learning. SS-CS interaction may contribute to this rapid plasticity as a form of receptive field plasticity in the cerebellar cortex between two receptive maps of sensory inputs from the external world and of efference copies from the will center for volitional movements.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fnsys.2015.00113
A trap motion in validating muscle activity prediction from musculoskeletal model using EMG,31,"Musculoskeletal modeling nowadays is becoming the most common tool for studying and analyzing human motion. Besides its potential in predicting muscle activity and muscle force during active motion, musculoskeletal modeling can also calculate many important kinetic data that are difficult to measure in vivo, such as joint force or ligament force. This paper will validate muscle activity predicted by the model during a static motion like knee flexion motion (squat motion). In this experiment, knee flexion motion was performed by 5 healthy subjects and modeled by using Gait Lower Extremity model from AnyBody Modeling System (AMS). Eight lower limb muscle activity prediction from the model will be validated by 8 EMG electrodes that measured the same muscles during squat motion. Muscle activity pattern and the position of onset would be used as a key factor in this validation study. Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to compare the pattern of both graphs. Knee joint force prediction from the model will also be compared with the literature studies. The result showed that 3 muscles showed high correlation coefficient, while the other 4 muscles showed slightly medium and one showed low correlation. Time delay of muscle activation between the model and EMG was recorded from Vastus Medialis muscle (18.38 ms) and Vastus Lateralis (22.8 ms), with muscle activation from the model was late compared to EMG. In conclusion, this statistical study has shown some detail differences between EMG and muscle activity prediction from the model. Knee flexion motion can be used as a trap motion when validating muscle activity of a musculoskeletal model, because the model will activate muscle activity based on motion data of markers, while in knee-flexed position, there was no marker’s movement, but the EMG was highly active due to the posture of the subjects in maintaining the knee-flexed position. However, the knee compressive force prediction from the model has showed positive confirmation from the literatures.",,,,,,"flexion motion and they measure muscles, but might be of interest",,10.14257/ijbsbt.2016.8.6.07
Estimating Sit-to-Stand Dynamics Using a Single Depth Camera,32,"Kinetic and dynamic motion analysis provides quantitative, functional assessments of human ability that are unobtainable through static imaging methods or subjective surveys. While biomechanics facilities are equipped to perform this measurement and analysis, the clinical translation of these methods is limited by the specialized skills and equipment needed. This paper presents and validates a method for estimating dynamic effects such as joint torques and body momenta using a single depth camera. An allometrically scaled, sagittal plane dynamic model is used to estimate the joint torques at the ankles, knees, hips, and low back, as well as the torso momenta, and shear and normal loads at the L5-S1 disk. These dynamic metrics are applied to the sit-to-stand motion and validated against a gold-standard biomechanical system consisting of full-body active motion-capture and force-sensing systems. The metrics obtained from the proposed method were found to have excellent concordance with peak metrics that are consistent with prior biomechanical studies.

The immediate reproduction of tactually perceived figures and the drawing process in reproducing the figures,33,"The present paper was to analyze experimentally how the immediate reproduction of tactually perceived geometrical figures was influenced by some factors of touching such as (i) the movement of the hand, (ii) the starting point of touching, and (iii) the extent in tactual surface and others, and to examine what S's drawing process in reproducing the figures were, in order to find out the conditions necessary for the tactile apprehension of figures. In Exp. I, the two conditions of touching were set; (a) the condition of active touch in which S with closed eyes was asked to feel actively, moving his forefinger once along the contour of the figures, and (b) the condition of passive touch in which S was asked to hold constantly the finger on the same position and to feel once, passively, the contour of the figures which were moved by E. The four starting points of touching were set in each stimulus figure (Fig. 1). After touching a figure S was asked to reproduce it with open eyes. The results were: (1) The apprehension of figures in Active touch was better than in Passive touch (Table 2 and Fig. 2). (2) Point a was the most favorable starting point of touching in the scalene square. In the square and the lozenge, the starting points and the conditions of touching were interacting, and the favorable points for apprehension varied with the variation of stimulus figures (Table 1 and Fig. 2). All these favourable points, however, coincided with the starting points or the terminal points of open eyed drawing of the same figure (Table 6). Thus they were relevant to the drawing processes of figures in some respects. (3) In both Active and Passive touch, most of the S's reproduced the figures in uninterrupted lines, repeating the same course as in the touching condition (“continuous reproduction”). On the other hand, “dividing construction” which one employed ordinarily with open eyes in drawing the figures, scarecely appeared (Table 4). In Exp. II a four segment (Table 7) and in Exp. II b eight patterns (Table 8) were used as stimulus figures. Besides the conditions of Active and Passive touch, the two conditions as to the direction of touching were set in each figure (Table 7 and 8). The results in Exp. II a were: (1) Only the perception of the orientation of the segments in Active touch was better than that in Passive touch (Table 7). (2) For the vertical and horizontal segments in the active condition, the directions of touching which were favorable for perceiving tend to correspond to those of drawing of the lines (Fig. 4). In Exp. II b, on the other hand, it was observed that (3) the perception of the angles contained by two segments, that of the orientation of each segment, and that of the equivalence between a vertical segment and a horizontal one were all better under the active touch condition than were under the passive touch condition (Table 8 and 9), (4) In Active touch of the stimulus patterns consisting of a horizontal segment and a vertical one, the touching in the direction opposite to that of the drawing was more favorable for the correct perception than the touching in the same direction as that of drawing, in contrast with Exp. II a (Table 8). (5) In Exp. II a and II b most of Ss employed the “continuous reproduction”. In Exp. III Ss were allowed to feel a figure freely to their satisfaction, with one finger, one hand or both hands, respectively. The results were: (1) As the condition of touching shifted from “single touching” (Exp. I) to “free touching” with one finger (Exp. III), the perception of a figure gradually improved (Fig. 6). (2) The increase of tactual surface, however, did not necessary result in the improvement of the perception of a figure (Fig. 5). (3) “Dividing construction” remarkably increased in every condition of Exp. III (Table 13). (4) It was suggested that if perception of a figure remained ambiguous, one employed “continuous reproduction”, and also that as the perception of a figure became clear, one used “dividing construction” with which one connected components of a figure into a whole. (5) Analysis of touching processes revealed that the function of active motion and the increase in tactual surface gave more chances of performing some operations with which one could analyze features in components of a figure. © 1967, The Japanese Psychological Association.

Effect of muscle loading and forearm rotation on radiocapitellar joint congruency,110,"INTRODUCTION: Degenerative changes are thought to occur as a result of altered j oint contact area and stresses caused by trauma. Much of the current literature related to the radiocapitellar joint focuses on the prosthetic design of radial head implants and their effect on joint contact mechanics. Native radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics, however, remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of muscle loading and forearm rotation on radiocapitellar joint congruency. Joint congruency is a measure of the relative 3D joint space between the subchondral surfaces of the joint and can be used to understand the underlying joint contact mechanics. METHODS: Joint congruency was examined in 7 cadaveric specimens (Male: 77±10 years) employing a previously developed inter-bone distance algorithm. Muscle tendons were attached to pneumatic actuators of a previously developed motion simulator to rotate the forearm from full pronation to supination2. Active and passive forearm rotation was performed with the elbow in 90° of flexion. CT scans were acquired prior to testing to create three-dimensional bony reconstructions of the proximal radius and distal ulna. Rigid-body computer registration was used to align the 3D CT models to the specimen during testing3. Inter-bone distances were measured to investigate the relative position of the capitellum to the radial head to assess overall joint congruency (2.5mm of inter-bone distance). Distances were displayed on 3D color-contour maps. Differences in congruency during active and passive forearm rotation were examined across the range of motion (two-way) and for every 10° of rotation using a one-way repeated measures of variance. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Figure 1 shows the mean (±1 SD) joint congruency as measured by the surface area on the subchondral bone that has an inter-bone distance of < 2.5mm for all specimens undergoing active and passive forearm rotation. The joint congruency decreases from active to passive forearm rotation (p=0.001). Examining the individual forearm positions, statistically significant differences between active and passive motion were found at -40° (p=0.04) and at -20° (p=0.03). Color-contour maps are shown across the range of motion in active and passive forearm rotation for a representative specimen (Figure 2). During active and passive rotation, as the elbow rotates from pronation to supination, the region of close proximity (shown from green-blue) decreases and is focused on the medial region of the radial head. DICUSSION: Previous investigations examining radiocapitellar joint contact have relied on invasive techniques (experimental casting, tekscan). Using this previously developed technique to evaluate joint tracking patterns, physiologic motion was simulated and the resulting joint congruency was non-invasively examined. The results of this current study suggest that the radiocapitellar joint is more reduced due to muscle forces acting across the joint during active motion. This effect is seen more in pronation than supination as indicated by finding statistical differences in joint congruency at 20 and 40 degrees of pronation. Future work is needed to better define the patterns of congruency pattern between active and passive rotation and explore the relationship to the patterns of degenerative changes which have been documented for this articulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Increasing our understanding of native radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics is useful in prosthetic design and in understanding the etiology of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, having knowledge of the effect of muscle load during physiologic forearm rotation may have implications for rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,10.1002/jor.23247 LK  - http://WT3CF4ET2L.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE&issn=1554527X&id=doi:10.1002%2Fjor.23247&atitle=Effect+of+muscle+loading+and+forearm+rotation+on+radiocapitellar+joint+congruency&stitle=J.+Orthop.+Res.&title=Journal+of+Orthopaedic+Research&volume=34&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Lalone&aufirst=Emily+A.&auinit=E.A.&aufull=Lalone+E.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2016&auinit1=E&auinitm=A
Improvement of hand function in African Americans with scleroderma: Use of a hand continuous passive motion,111,Introduction: Movement in the hands is essential to daily functional activities however persons with Scleroderma are at high risk for loosing this function which can lead to loss of independence. It is therefore essential that rehabilitation healthcare professionals work to maintain hand function in these individuals so that independent living can continue while living with this disease and that a good quality of life can be preserved. Subjects: Three African American individuals who were diagnosed with Scleroderma and had hand involvement were assessed for hand function and given standard exercise program. Methods: Active range of motion (ROM) was performed on bilateral wrists and hands and the Arthritis Hand Function Test (AHFT) was performed. Each individual was instructed to participate in a daily active motion exercise program for both hands. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine was placed on the right hand of each individual and the left hand received no CPM intervention. The Arthritis Hand Function Test was also administered. Each individual wore the CPM at night from 2-4 hours on the right hand only. Measurements were taken after at least four weeks of CPM for comparison. The medical records of these individuals were reviewed for this study. Results: Two of the subjects gained greater than 60 degrees of total active movement of the digits on the hand that received the CPM as compared to the hand that had only active exercise. The other subject gained more active movement in the hand that did not have CPM treatment but did have daily active exercise. All of the subjects had improvement in the AHFT. Significance: This pilot study shows that improvement in hand function can improve with intervention addressing motion of the hands. Whether active motion alone or active motion with the addition of continuous passive motion is optimal treatment intervention is not clear. This pilot should provide a basis for further research into which is the best treatment for individuals at risk of losing hand function and independence.,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/art.29841
Intra- and inter-raters reliabilities of a stepped clinical assessment of chronic spastic paresis in adults,112,"Objective To determine intra- and inter-raters reliabilities of a stepped clinical assessment in chronic spastic paresis for upper and lower limbs in adults. Methods Eighteen adult subjects (age: 50 ± 14 years, women: 21%) with upper and lower limbs chronic hemiparesis were evaluated by four raters (3 PMR, 1 physiotherapist, age 47 ± 11 years; experience in spastic paresis 14 ± 9 years). This assessment involves performing a passive muscle stretch at 2 velocities, very slow and very fast, followed by an active maximal movement by the patient against the tested muscle and then a 15-second series of active movements of maximal amplitude of which only the last one is measured. Eight muscles were tested: shoulder extensors, elbow flexors, wrist flexors, fingers flexors, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, soleus and gastrocnemii. Five parameters were collected: maximal range of passive motion XV1, angle of catch XV3, spasticity grade Y, maximal range of active motion XA, and residual range of motion XVA15 after 15 seconds of rapid alternating movements. Each patient was evaluated on two occasions by each rater one week apart. After the first 9 patients, a 2-hour training was organized before assessing the last 9 patients. Main outcome measures were intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI95%) for quantitative data and agreement frequencies for ranges of movement (ordinal data). Results Before training, intra- and inter-reliabilities were excellent: intra-rater ICCs by parameter all muscles taken together: XV1 0.90 [0.60-0.98], XV3 0.84 [0.45-0.96], XA 0.92 [0.68-0.98], XA15 0.90 [0.68-0.98] and inter-raters ICCs, XV1 0.90 [0.72-0.97], XV3 0.83 [0.56-0.95], XA 0.95 [0.87-0.99], XA15 0.95 [0.86-0.98]. After training, both reliabilities improved: intra-rater ICCs, XV1 0.91 [0.65-0.98], XV3 0.92 [0.66-0.98], XA 0.94 [0.67-0.99], XA15 0.93 [0.64-0.99] and inter-raters ICCs, XV10.91 [0.74-0.98], XV3 0.91 [0.75-0.97], XA 0.94 [0.85-0.99], XA15 0.96 [0.87-0.99] (P < 0.05). Training also improved intra- and inter-raters agreement frequencies for ranges of movement (Y): respectively 75 and 70% before training, 84 and 76% after training (P < 0.05). Discussion The stepped clinical assessment shows an excellent reliability to evaluate resistance against movement in chronic spastic paresis in the upper and lower limbs of adults. Training, associated with further improvement in reliability, needed nevertheless to be strengthened for shoulder extensors, fingers flexors and rectus femoris.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.rehab.2015.07.016
How the wide awake approach is changing hand surgery and therapy,113,"The wide-awake approach to flexor tendon repair has decreased our rupture and tenolysis rates, and permitted us to get consistently good results in cooperative patients. We no longer perform flexor tendon repair with the tourniquet, sedation and muscle paralysis of general or block (Bier or axillary) anesthesia. Injection of only lidocaine with epinephrine wherever incisions will be made in the finger and hand permits comfortable tourniquet-free awake patients cooperate with active finger full flexion and extension testing during the surgery. 5 main reasons that I never want to do a flexor tendon repair asleep or with a motor block ever again 1) Avoid gap and rupture When a patient takes the tendon repair through a full active range of motion during the surgery, 7% of the time, the surgeon will observe a gap that occurs because the tendon suture is not tight enough. The gap can be repaired with a tighter suture before the skin is closed to avoid rupture. In our series of 102 patients with intraoperative testing of wide awake flexor tendon repair, 7 patients showed intraoperative gapping that was repaired before the skin was closed. They did not rupture postoperatively. None of the 102 patients who followed proper postoperative instructions with true active early protected movement ruptured after surgery. (Higgins A, Lalonde DH, Bell M, et al. Avoiding flexor tendon repair rupture with intraoperative total active movement examination. Plast Reconstr Surg 2010; 126:941-5.) 2) Seeing a full fist of flexion and full active extension during the surgery without gap gives us the confidence to know they will not rupture with half a fist of flexion and half full extension with protected movement 3 days after the surgery We no longer use Kleinert rubber bands or 'place and hold' with protected post-operative active movement. True active movement, just enough to keep the tendon gliding a little, is giving us better results. In the first 2-4 days after surgery, we keep the hand elevated and immobile in a splint with the wrist in comfortable 25-45degree of extension (not flexed or neutral). The MP joint is flexed to a comfortable 45degreeto 80degree from full extension, and the PIP and DIP joints are fully extended. Collagen formation does not start until day 3, so serious adhesions will not start before then. We avoid immediate movement after surgery as this generates bleeding inside the wound which adds to the scar tissue. Also, the finger and tendons are swollen and have more friction as they try to move in the sheath in the first 3 days. Elevation and immobilization decrease bleeding and swelling in the first days after surgery. Day 3 to 4 weeks after surgery, they stay in the splint but come out hourly for early protected movement hourly while awake if the fingers are not swollen and hurting, and if they are off all pain medication. They passively warm up the MP, PIP, and DIP joints with flexion to decrease friction and work of the tendons before starting active movement. We allow up to half a fist of midrange active flexion of the fingers and focus on full active extension of the PIP and DIP joints. (45-90degreeof active flexion of MP, 0-45degreeof active flexion of the PIP and DIP joints). We do not allow full active or passive full flexion of the PIP and DIP joints (45-90degree) because this would increase the friction across the repair as well as increase the risk that the tendon repair site flex at 90degreeor more and get caught on the proximal hard edge of a fully flexed A4 pulley and pulling the repair apart. We have seen this problem with active movement during surgery and solved it by dividing the A4 pulley. We tell patients: 'You can move it but you can't use it and you can't do what hurts.' 3) Decrease the need for tenolysis We almost never need to do tenolysis after flexor tendon repair now. The reason is that we make sure we have a full range of active flexion and extension before the skin is closed so that tenolysis is less likely to be needed postoperatively. If the repair does not fit through the pulleys during the surgery, it is not likely to fit through the pulleys later and will almost certainly require a tenolysis. After the repair, the awake comfortable patient with no tourniquet is asked to flex and extend the finger completely. If the repair gets caught on pulleys, we incrementally vent (divide) only as much pulley as we need to in order to see full active flexion and extension. We agree with Jin Bo Tang that the entire A4 pulley and up to half of the distal A2 pulley can be divided without causing bowstringing if most of the cruciate pulleys are preserved. What you see with active movement during surgery is what you get. It changes the whole operation. An alternative to venting pulleys is to trim the repair or slim it with more sutures so it can fit through the pulleys before you close the skin. 4) You get at least a full hour during which the surgeon (and the therapist) can educate the patient during the surgery An educated patient is much more likely to do what he should right after surgery than one who wakes up with a freshly repaired flexor tendon and has no idea what he should or should not be doing. In addition, the awake patient has seen his finger move well during the surgery and knows it will work if he follows the instructions given to him during the surgery. Seeing is believing. I talk to my patients during the surgery and explain to them how to look after their hand after surgery. We also have our therapists come into the clinic room where we do our surgery to intraoperatively assess the patients, see the repaired structures moving, and educate the patient before and during skin closure. The patient gets to meet and know the therapist during the surgery. 5) You get to see the effect of repairing superficialis in zone II and deciding whether or not to keep that repair We first repair profundus and be sure we see full active movement with no gapping. If the repair of superficialis seems like it will be possible or helpful, we go ahead and do it and retest full active fist flexion and extension. If the movement is downgraded by repairing superficialis, we will take down that repair. There is currently debate about to repair or not repair superficialis. Seeing the movement during the surgery takes away all debate because seeing movement is understanding results.",,,,,,,,10.1186/1753-6561-9-s3-a80
Shoulder External Rotation Tendon Transfers for Brachial Plexus Birth Palsy,114,INDICATIONS n Weak shoulder external rotation associated with C5-6 palsy and: • Strong donor muscles (latissimus dorsi and teres major) on Active Movement Scale (AMS) for infant assessment • Active shoulder abduction ≥ 60° on AMS • Well-maintained passive range of motion (PROM) of the shoulder • Impairment of bimanual overhead activities • Good hand function on AMS P i t f a l l s • Severe glenohumeral dysplasia and/or dislocation • Deltoid paralysis (ERTT cannot sub-stitute for absent abduction) Controversies • Timing of external rotation tendon transfer (ERTT) n ERTT should be performed before contracture (diminished PROM) occurs; this can be seen in infancy. n Compliance with postoperative therapy (which is limited in infants and toddlers) may improve outcomes. n ERTT may halt progression of glenohumeral dysplasia; early dysplasia is a possible indication. • Poor hand function limits functional improvement from ERTT.,,,,,,,,10.1016/b978-1-4160-4915-9.00002-8
Dynamic alterations in chemokine gradients induce transendothelial shuttling of human T cells under physiologic shear conditions,115,"The active movement of cells from subendothelial compartments into the bloodstream (intravasation) has been recognized for several decades by histologic and physiologic studies, yet the molecular effectors of this process are relatively uncharacterized. For extravasation, studies based predominantly on static transwell assays support a general model, whereby transendothelial migration (TEM) occurs via chemoattraction toward increasing chemokine concentrations. However, this model of chemotaxis cannot readily reconcile how chemokines influence intravasation, as shear forces of blood flow would likely abrogate luminal chemokine gradient(s). Thus, to analyze how T cells integrate perivascular chemokine signals under physiologic flow, we developed a novel transwell-based flow chamber allowing for real-time modulation of chemokine levels above (luminal/apical compartment) and below (abluminal/subendothelial compartment) HUVEC monolayers. We routinely observed human T cell TEM across HUVEC monolayers with the combination of luminal CXCL12 and abluminal CCL5. With increasing concentrations of CXCL12 in the luminal compartment, transmigrated T cells did not undergo retrograde transendothelial migration (retro-TEM). However, when exposedto abluminal CXCL12, transmigrated T cells underwent striking retro-TEM and re-entered the flow stream [corrected]. This CXCL12 fugetactic (chemorepellant) effect was concentration-dependent, augmented by apical flow, blocked by antibodies to integrins, and reduced by AMD3100 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CXCL12-induced retro-TEM was inhibited by PI3K antagonism and cAMP agonism. These findings broaden our understanding of chemokine biology and support a novel paradigm by which temporospatial modulations in subendothelial chemokine display drive cell migration from interstitial compartments into the bloodstream.",,,,,,,,10.1189/jlb.0309214
Role of peripheral afference during acquisition of a complex coordination task,34,"It has long been supposed that the interference observed in certain patterns of coordination is mediated, at least in part, by peripheral afference from the moving limbs. We manipulated the level of afferent input, arising from movement of the opposite limb, during the acquisition of a complex coordination task. Participants learned to generate flexion and extension movements of the right wrist, of 75° amplitude, that were a quarter cycle out of phase with a 1-Hz sinusoidal visual reference signal. On separate trials, the left wrist either was at rest, or was moved passively by a torque motor through 50°, 75° or 100°, in synchrony with the reference signal. Five acquisition sessions were conducted on successive days. A retention session was conducted 1 week later. Performance was initially superior when the opposite limb was moved passively than when it was static. The amplitude and frequency of active movement were lower in the static condition than in the driven conditions and the variation in the relative phase relation across trials was greater than in the driven conditions. In addition, the variability of amplitude, frequency and the relative phase relation during each trial was greater when the opposite limb was static than when driven. Similar effects were expressed in electromyograms. The most marked and consistent differences in the accuracy and consistency of performance (defined in terms of relative phase) were between the static condition and the condition in which the left wrist was moved through 50°. These outcomes were exhibited most prominently during initial exposure to the task. Increases in task performance during the acquisition period, as assessed by a number of kinematic variables, were generally well described by power functions. In addition, the recruitment of extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and the degree of co-contraction of flexor carpi radialis and ECR, decreased during acquisition. Our results indicate that, in an appropriate task context, afferent feedback from the opposite limb, even when out of phase with the focal movement, may have a positive influence upon the stability of coordination.",,,,,,might be of interest,comparison between static and passive,10.1007/s00221-002-1063-3
E36. FEATURES OF ALGORITHM-STAGE OF MEDICAL REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS AND DISABLEDS AFTER TOTAL ARTHROPLASTY IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,116,"Background: Lesions of the hip especially hip ankylosis joints, manifested severe dysfunction of the lower extremities and spine on background of severe pain syndrome occupy one of the second largest ankylosing spondyloarthrosis. The purpose is to optimize the medical rehabilitation of pateints and disableds with pathology of ankylosing joints. Methods: In our clinic, during 2010-2015, total replacement of both coxofemoral joints were implemented in 14 patients. Age ranged from 25 to 49 years: 12 men and 2 women and 11 patients with ankylosing spondyloarthrosis and 3 with rheumatoid arthritis. Results: Massage courses of thigh and gluteal region and gymnastics classes with an active development movements in adjacent joints were performed in the process of preparing patients for surgery, which helps to strengthen thigh muscles biarticular and facilitates the process of postoperative recovery movements. Period of early functional rehabilitation begins in operation day in ward of intensive therapy. The patient were performed gymnastics in the hip on passive flexion of up to 10-15°C, an active movement in the ankle and knee joint. The patient is taught of self-fulfillment of isometric exercises for both lower extremities. The patient is taught to get up and go on the bed, take the stairs. The objective of the period of intensive functional rehabilitation is restore normal muscle strength and range of motion in the hip joint. During this period, electrical stimulation of abductor muscle groups are carried out and patients are involved in treadmill walking and balance development. Training and developing the correct gait of new movement patterns is carried out with the participation of the instructor and held in a specially equipped gymnastics hall. Positive (good) results were determined in 12 patients, two patients results were satisfactory result. Conclusion: Our algorithm-stage of rehabilitation of patients and disabled people after arthroplasty seems to be effective but requires further study.",,,,,,,,10.1093/rheumatology/kex063.035
Management of shoulder deformities in brachial plexus birth palsies,117,"Background: During the last century, there has been growing evidence that dislocation of the glenohumeral joint in children commonly occurs with brachial plexus birth palsy, often in the first year of life. Etiology: Permanent injuries to the brachial plexus in childhood create a muscle imbalance about the shoulder during the reinnervation process. This results in an internal rotation contracture, external rotation weakness, and subsequent glenoid retroversion, posterior deficiency, joint subluxation, and eventual dislocation. Evaluation: On physical examination with scapular stabilization, there is limited passive external rotation in adduction and abduction. Ultrasounds, arthrograms, and magnetic resonance imaging help in evaluating the deformity of glenohumeral deformity and dislocation. At present magnetic resonance imaging is the standard on which operative intervention is based. Treatment: Initial treatment is physical therapy with passive glenohumeral mobilization with scapular stabilization. Failure to regain or maintain passive external rotation and evidence of joint instability or dislocation on examination are indicators for for futher evaluation and intervention. Nonsurgical interventions such as Botox injections, or splinting or SPICA cast may be considered. Ultimately, contracture release, potential joint reduction, and extra-articular muscle transfer surgery has been the standard of care, though there is ongoing debate regarding whether release alone is sufficient. It is important not to overlengthen the subscapularis or over release the glenohumeral joint, which can cause loss of internal rotation power and development of external rotation contracture. Outcomes: Early operative intervention in the form of extra-articular rebalancing techniques has become the standard of care, providing the best opportunity for enhanced motion and function, and improved validated Mallet, Active Movement, and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument scores. Long-term improvements in outcome may rest on joint remodeling by arthroscopic or open reduction, though further research is still required to evaluate remodeling of joints over the course of a lifetime. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,,,,,,,10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181c1893d
Brain representation of active and passive hand movements in children,118,"Several functional neuroimaging studies have been performed exploring the sensorimotor function in children with neurologic disorders. However, little is known about normal activation patterns of the sensorimotor system at a young age. We explored brain representation of active and passive hand movements in school-age children and young adults. Nine healthy children (7-15 y) and six adults were studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired on a 1.5-T scanner in block designs. Active movement consisted of repetitive opening and closing of the hand; passive movement consisted of the same movement performed by the examiner. Both hands were assessed separately. The pattern of brain activation (contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), ipsilateral cerebellum, supplementary motor area (SMA), and lateral premotor cortex (PMC) was generally more widespread in the adult group, suggesting a developmental course in the organization of both motor and sensory cortex. Surprisingly, no difference was generally detected when contrasting active versus passive tasks. Our results suggest that active and passive hand movements can be used for the exploration of the sensorimotor system in children. Passive and active tasks confirmed to be tightly coupled, thus supporting the idea of the former as a helpful performance-independent paradigm in the study of brain reorganization and presurgical assessment. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

"Characteristics of shoulder-position sense: Effects of mode of movement, scapular support, and arm orientation",35,"Context: Although the repositioning test is widely used to evaluate proprioception, the effects of several test-associated variables on the test outcome are not known. Objective: To determine the effects of mode of movement, scapular support, and arm orientation on shoulder-position sense. Participants: 49 healthy, randomly selected men. Methods: The repositioning test was conducted in 4 settings in which mode of movement, scapular support, and arm orientation were manipulated differently. Main Outcome Measure: Position-sense acuity was quantified as repositioning accuracy and consistency. Results: Active limb movement significantly enhanced repositioning accuracy and consistency compared with passive movement. Repositioning consistency was significantly better when the scapula was supported than when it was not. Arm orientation had no significant effect on repositioning accuracy and consistency. Conclusion: The protocol for evaluating or rehabilitating shoulder proprioception should include active limb movement with the scapula unsupported to ensure that it reflects a patient's proprioceptive demand during functional activities.",,,,,,might be of interest,,https://doi.org/10.1123/jsr.11.3.157
Corticomotor excitability of wrist flexor and extensor muscles during active and passive movement,119,"The excitability of the corticospinal projection to upper and lower limbs is constantly modulated during voluntary and passive movement; however a direct comparison during a comparable movement has not been reported. In the present study we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to compare corticomotor excitability to the extensor and flexor carpi radialis (ECR/FCR) muscles of the forearm during voluntary rhythmic wrist movement (through 45° of range), during a matched (for range and rhythm) passive movement of the wrist, and while the wrist was stationary (in mid-range). TMS was delivered when the wrist was in the neutral position. With passive and active movement, and for both FCR and ECR, corticomotor excitability was reduced during lengthening relative to shortening phases of movement. With active movement, this pattern was maintained and superimposed on an overall increase in excitability to both muscles that was greater for the ECR. The results favor a common pattern of excitability changes shared by extensor and flexor muscles as they undergo lengthening and shortening, which may be mediated by afferent input during both passive and active movement. This is combined with an overall increase in excitability associated with active movement that is greater for extensor muscles perhaps due to differences in the strength of the corticomotor projection to these muscles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.humov.2010.03.003

Synergistic movements predominate. 5. Spasticity wanes. Can move out of synergies although synergies still present. 6. Coordination and movement patterns near normal. Trouble with more rapid complex movements. 7. Normal. Stages of Motor Recovery of the Chedoke McMaster Stroke Impairment Inventory (Gowland et al. 1993) Stages Characteristics 1 Flaccid paralysis is present. Phasic stretch reflexes are absent or hypoactive. Active movement cannot be elicited reflexively with a facilitatory stimulus or volitionally. 2 Spasticity is present and is felt as a resistance to passive movement. No voluntary movement is present but a facilitatory stimulus will elicit the limb synergies reflexively. These limb synergies consist of stereotypical flexor and extensor movements. 3 Spasticity is marked. The synergistic movements can be elicited voluntarily but are not obligatory. 4 Spasticity decreases. Synergy patterns can be reversed if movement takes place in the weaker synergy first. Movement combining antagonistic synergies can be performed when the prime movers are the strong components of the synergy. 5 Spasticity wanes, but is evident with rapid movement and at the extremes of range. Synergy patterns can be revised even if the movement takes place in the strongest synergy first. Movements that utilize the weak components of both synergies acting as prime movers can be performed. 6 Coordination and patterns of movement can be near normal. Spasticity as demonstrated by resistance to passive movement is no longer present. Abnormal patterns of movement with faulty timing emerge when rapid or complex actions are requested. 7 Normal. A "" normal "" variety of rapid, age appropriate complex movement patterns are possible with normal timing, coordination, strength and endurance.

Assessing proprioception: A critical review of methods,121,"To control movement, the brain has to integrate proprioceptive information from a variety of mechanoreceptors. The role of proprioception in daily activities, exercise, and sports has been extensively investigated, using different techniques, yet the proprioceptive mechanisms underlying human movement control are still unclear. In the current work we have reviewed understanding of proprioception and the three testing methods: threshold to detection of passive motion, joint position reproduction, and active movement extent discrimination, all of which have been used for assessing proprioception. The origin of the methods, the different testing apparatus, and the procedures and protocols used in each approach are compared and discussed.

Diagnosis and classification of temporomandibular dysfunction by the general dental practitioner [Diagnostiek en classificatie van temporomandibulaire dysfuncties door de tandarts algemeen-practicus.],122,"Because of other diseases mimicking the symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance. Diagnostic subgroups of TMD (osteoarthrosis, anterior disc displacement with/without reduction, TMD-myo) can be distinguished by a combination of active movements, passive opening and palpation. Active movement appeared to be the most powerful test for distinguishing the subgroups of TMD, e.g. myogenous, arthrogenous, myogenous and arthrogenous. It is advised to have an open mind in the clinical examination and to be aware of the many mimicking disorders before reaching a diagnosis. An anamnestic questionnaire addressing the pain history, signs and symptoms of TMD, functional impairments, correlates of TMD, psychosocial evaluation and general health status is mandatory. Headache and neck pain often accompany TMD. In appropriate situations it is advised to refer to the proper specialist, before starting treatment for TMD. Orthopedic tests of the cervical spine are of minor importance in discriminating between patients with TMD and patients with cervical spine disorders (CSD). It is therefore advised to evaluate the function of the stomatognathic system in patients with neck complaints to rule out a possible involvement of this system.",,,,,,,,
Rapid increases in ventilation accompany the transition from passive to active movement,123,"We used a novel movement transition technique to look for evidence of a rapid onset drive to breathe related to the active component of exercise in humans. Ten volunteers performed the following transitions in a specially designed tandem exercise chair apparatus: rest to passive movement, passive to active movement, and rest to active movement. The transition from rest to active exercise was accompanied by an immediate increase in ventilation, as was the transition from rest to passive leg movement (Δ = 6.06 ± 1.09 l min-1, p < 0.001 and Δ = 3.30 ± 0.57 l min-1, p = 0.002, respectively). When subjects actively assumed the leg movements, ventilation again increased immediately and significantly (Δ = 2.55 ± 0.52 l min-1, p = 0.032). Ventilation at the first point of active exercise was the same when started either from rest or from a background of passive leg movement (p = 1.00). We conclude that the use of a transition from passive to active leg movements in humans recruits a ventilatory drive related to the active component of exercise, and this can be discerned as a rapid increase in breathing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of passive and active movement on vibrotactile detection thresholds of the Pacinian channel and forward masking,36,"We investigated the gating effect of passive and active movement on the vibrotactile detection thresholds of the Pacinian (P) psychophysical channel and forward masking. Previous work on gating mostly used electrocutaneous stimulation and did not allow focusing on tactile submodalities. Ten healthy adults participated in our study. Passive movement was achieved by swinging a platform, on which the participants stimulated hand was attached, manually by a trained operator. The root-mean-square value of the movement speed was kept in a narrow range (slow: 10-20 cm/s, fast: 50-60cm/s). Active movement was performed by the participant him-/herself using the same apparatus. The tactile stimuli consisted of 250-Hz sinusoidal mechanical vibrations, which were generated by a shaker mounted on the movement platform and applied to the middle fingertip. In the forward-masking experiments, a high-level masking stimulus preceded the test stimulus. Each movement condition was tested separately in a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Both passive and active movement caused a robust gating effect, that is, elevation of thresholds, in the fast speed range. Statistically significant change of thresholds was not found in slow movement conditions. Passive movement yielded higher thresholds than those measured during active movement, but this could not be confirmed statistically. On the other hand, the effect of forward masking was approximately constant as the movement condition varied. These results imply that gating depends on both peripheral and central factors in the P channel. Active movement may have some facilitatory role and produce less gating. Additionally, the results support the hypothesis regarding a critical speed for gating, which may be relevant for daily situations involving vibrations transmitted through grasped objects and for manual exploration.",,,,,,might be interesting,,https://doi.org/10.3109/08990220.2015.1091771
Transcortical reflexes and servo control of movement,124,"Sherrington proposed that the major role of proprioceptors is in processing afferent inputs generated by the active movements of the animal itself, and noted that the reflex effects of proprioceptive inputs are 'mild'. Current experimental results are consistent with the view that the major role of both segmental and transcortical proprioceptive reflexes is in small active movements and active postural stability, with muscle afferent inputs reducing '...errors of muscle length produced by fluctuating levels of motor discharge...' as stated by Goodwin and coworkers in 1978. Exteroceptive reflexes generate intense muscular responses and are of critical importance in prompt reprogramming essential for effective responses to environmental stimuli. Within the motor cortex (MI) there is a caudal region (MI/c) which receives exteroceptive cutaneous inputs and a rostral region (MI/r) which receives proprioceptive inputs. Transcortical reflexes mediated via pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) of MI/r have properties which are analogous to segmental proprioceptive reflexes: changes of muscle length elicit PTN discharges which oppose the length change and so act to maintain stability. Furthermore, MI/r PTNs which are recruited earliest for small active movements are most sensitive to proprioceptive inputs. Data are not yet available concerning transcortical reflexes via MI/c during voluntary movement, but it is speculated that the cutaneous reflexes via MI/c might be functionally analogous to segmental cutaneous reflexes. Short-latency reflex responses also occur in postcentral (PoC) PTNs, and in this report we present results concerning the properties of PoC PTNs during active and passive movement. Caudal (area 2-5) PoC PTNs were similar to MI PTNs in that they often discharged prior to electromyogram (EMG) activity with active movement, and had different discharge frequencies with different steady state loads, but were unlike most MI PTNs in having the same changes of discharge with active and passive movement. Our finding of PoC discharge prior to movement onset, confirming that of Soso and Fetz in 1980, is discussed in connection with the concept of corollary discharge.",,,,,,,,10.1139/y81-112
Functional reorganization in chronic hemiparetic patients after training: FMRI studies,125,"The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of short-term repetitive-bilateral exercise on the activation of motor network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eight control subjects and four chronic hemiparetic patients were investigated for the present study. The training program with a symmetrical upper-limb motion trainer was performed at 1 hr/day, 5 days/week during 6 weeks. Fugl-Meyer assessments (FMA) were performed every two weeks during the training. We compared cerebral and cerebellar cortical activations in two different tasks before and after the training program: (1) the only unaffected hand movement (Task 1), and (2) passive movements of the affected hand by the active movement of the unaffected hand (Task 2). fMRI was performed at 3T with wrist flexion-extension movement at 1 Hz during the motor tasks. All patients showed significant improvements of FMA scores in their paretic limbs after training. fMRI studies in Task 1 showed that cortical activations decreased in ipsilateral SMC but increased in contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and ipsilateral cerebellum (CRB). Task 2 showed cortical reorganizations in bilateral SMC, pre-motor area (PMA), supplementary area (SMA) and CRB. This study demonstrated that plastic changes of motor network occurred as a neural basis of the improvement subsequent to repetitive-bilateral exercises using the symmetrical upper-limb motion trainer.",,,,,hemiparetic patients ?,only neural analysis,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/kem.321-323.1016
FMRI assessment of upper extremity related brain activation with an MRI-compatible manipulandum,126,"Purpose: Longitudinal studies to evaluate the effect of rehabilitative therapies require an objective, reproducible and quantitative means for testing function in vivo. An fMRI assessment tool for upper extremity related brain activation using an MRI-compatible manipulandum was developed and tested for use in neurorehabilitation research. Methods: Fifteen healthy, right-handed subjects participated in two fMRI sessions, which were three to four weeks apart. A block design paradigm, composed of three conditions of subject-passive movement, subject-active movement and rest, was employed for the fMRI recordings. During the rest condition, subjects simply held the device handle without applying any force or movement. The same type of auditory and visual instructions were given in all the three conditions, guiding the subjects to perform the motor tasks interactively with the MRI-compatible arm manipulandum. The tasks were controlled across the fMRI sessions. The subjects' brain activation was recorded by fMRI, and their behavioral performance was recorded by the manipulandum. The brain network activated by the subjects' interaction with the manipulandum was identified, and the reproducibility and reliability of the obtained activation were determined. Results: All subjects completed the trial protocol. Two subjects were excluded from analysis due to head motion artifacts. All passive movements were performed well. Four out of the total 780 active movements were missed by two subjects. Brain activation was found in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and non-primary motor cortex as well as in subcortical areas in the thalamus, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. These activations were consistent across the two fMRI sessions. Conclusion: The MRI-compatible manipulandum elicited robust and reproducible brain activations in healthy subjects during the subject-active and subject-passive upper extremity motor tasks with a block design paradigm. This system is promising for many applications in neurorehabilitation research and may be useful for longitudinal studies. © 2010 CARS.",,,,,,fMRI,,10.1007/s11548-010-0525-5
Central neural mechanisms of touch and proprioception,127,"The argument is made that somesthesia is not a strictly passive process, and its central neuronal mechanisms cannot be studied in all their complexity and subtlety by applying passive stimuli to uninterested or unconscious animals. The case is clear for kinesthesia. Peripheral proprioceptive signals are altered by active muscle contractions, and the central mechanisms of kinesthetic sensations should be studied during active movement. Moreover, the generation of a central neural representation of the mechanical stimulus is only part of the tactile preceptual process. It is also influenced by the behavioral, attentive, and motivational state of the animal, whose effects can only be revealed in awake animals actively participating in discrimination tasks.",,,,,,seems like a review paper,,10.1139/y94-078
The virtual hand illusion and body ownership,38,"The illusion described here is well documented, and known as the rubber hand illusion (RHI). It is used to investigate perceptual processes and multisensory interactions. In the presented study we aimed to achieve the projected sensation using a paradigm designed to achieve a Virtual Hand Illusion (VHI). This allowed the exploration of novel stimuli including passive and active movement of the arm, self stimulus and haptic stimuli other than just brushing.

Single unit analysis of the human ventral thalamic nuclear group: Activity correlated with movement,128,"During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells). The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response). The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement.Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg. Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body. Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87). Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells). Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields. Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell. Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint. The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",,,,,,,,10.1093/brain/113.6.1795
Active versus passive touch: Factors influencing the transmission of somatosensory signals to primary sornatosensory cortex,129,"Active and passive touch, respectively with and without voluntary movement on the part of the subject, are frequently reported to be equivalent in terms of the resultant perceptual abilities. This review reexamines the notion of perceptual equivalence in the light of growing evidence that the transmission of tactile inputs is diminished, or 'gated,' during the Course of active movement. It is concluded that there is indeed gating of cutaneous inputs during active touch. In most experiments, the paradoxical observation of perceptual equivalence between active and passive touch can partly be explained by the choice of task, namely, tactile discriminations that depend on relative, and not absolute, differences in inputs. The surprising lack of evidence for any superiority of passive touch over active touch can likely be explained by several factors. First, performance with active touch may be enhanced by the motor strategy, e.g., by reducing the speed; of movement at critical points, and so reducing the degree of gating, and (or) by optimally orienting the exploring digits so as to bring the most sensitive skin areas into contact with the object in question. Second, central influences, including attention and motor set, may be specifically activated during voluntary movement and contribute to enhancing performance during active touch. Thus, the gating influences associated with active touch may be offset, partly or wholly, by the combined influence of these factors to yield (near) perceptual equivalence for active and passive touch.",,,,,,review,relevant review but not experimental data,10.1139/y94-080
Prediction of primary somatosensory neuron activity during active tactile exploration,130,"Primary sensory neurons form the interface between world and brain. Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neurons of awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by whisker angle, but well- predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are in apparent contrast to previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of sense organs.",,,,,They could have behavioral data,,,10.7554/eLife.10696
Achronopresence: how temporal visuotactile and visuomotor mismatches modulate embodiment,40,"The loss of body ownership, the feeling that your body and its limbs no longer belong to you, presents a severe clinical condition that has proven difficult to study directly. We here propose a novel paradigm using mixed reality to interfere with natural embodiment using temporally conflicting sensory signals from the own hand. In Experiment 1 we investigated how such a mismatch affects phenomenological and physiological aspects of embodiment, and identified its most important dimensions using a principle component analysis. The results suggest that such a mismatch induces a strong reduction in embodiment accompanied by an increase in feelings of disownership and deafference, which was, however, not reflected in physiological changes. In Experiment 2 we refined the paradigm to measure perceptual thresholds for temporal mismatches and compared how different multimodal, mismatching information alters the sense of embodiment. The results showed that while visual delay decreased embodiment both while actively moving and during passive touch, the effect was stronger for the former. Our results extend previous findings as they demonstrate that a sense of disembodiment can be induced through controlled multimodal mismatches about one’s own body and more so during active movement as compared to passive touch. Based on the ecologically more valid protocol we propose here, we argue that such a sense of disembodiment may fundamentally differ from disownership sensations as discussed in the rubber hand illusion literature, and emphasize its clinical relevance. This might importantly advance the current debate on the relative contribution of different modalities to our sense of body and its plasticity.",24.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/bbbe2c0a2c806a9ba4d95fb346e868d8/faa43456/24.pdf),,,,This deserves to be checked,,nothing about active-passive distinction,https://doi.org/10.1101/596858
Contribution of motion parallax to segmentation and depth perception,131,"Relative image motion resulting from active movement of the observer could potentially serve as a powerful perceptual cue, both for segmentation of object boundaries and for depth perception. To examine the perceptual role of motion parallax from shearing motion, we measured human performance in three psychophysical tasks: segmentation, depth ordering, and depth magnitude estimation. Stimuli consisted of random dot textures that were synchronized to head movement with sine- or square-wave modulation patterns. Segmentation was assessed with a 2AFC orientation judgment of a motion-defined boundary. In the depth-ordering task, observers reported which modulation half-cycle appeared in front of the other. Perceived depth magnitude was matched to that of a 3D rendered image with multiple static cues. The results indicate that head movement might not be important for segmentation, even though it is crucial for obtaining depth from motion parallax-thus, concomitant depth perception does not appear to facilitate segmentation. Our findings suggest that segmentation works best for abrupt, sharply defined motion boundaries, whereas smooth gradients are more powerful for obtaining depth from motion parallax. Thus, motion parallax may contribute in a different manner to segmentation and to depth perception and suggests that their underlying mechanisms might be distinct. © ARVO.",,,,,I don't think they have a passive condition,I think there are no passive vs active conditions,,10.1167/11.9.13
Gone in 06 Seconds The Encoding of Motor Memories,42,"Real-world tasks often require movements that depend on a previous action or on changes in the state of the world. Here we investigate whether motor memories encode the current action in a manner that depends on previous sensorimotor states. Human subjects performed trials in which they made movements in a randomly selected clockwise or counterclockwise velocity-dependent curl force field. Movements during this adaptation phase were preceded by a contextual phase that determined which of the two fields would be experienced on any given trial. As expected from previous research, when static visual cues were presented in the contextual phase, strong interference (resulting in an inability to learn either field) was observed. In contrast, when the contextual phase involved subjects making a movement that was continuous with the adaptation-phase movement, a substantial reduction in interference was seen. As the time between the contextual and adaptation movement increased, so did the interference, reaching a level similar to that seen for static visual cues for delays >600 ms. This contextual effect generalized to purely visual motion, active movement without vision, passive movement, and isometric force generation. Our results show that sensorimotor states that differ in their recent temporal history can engage distinct representations in motor memory, but this effect decays progressively over time and is abolished by ∼600 ms. This suggests that motor memories are encoded not simply as a mapping from current state to motor command but are encoded in terms of the recent history of sensorimotor states.",,,,,,,,
Otoacoustic emissions from insect ears: Evidence of active hearing?,132,"Sensitive hearing organs often employ nonlinear mechanical sound processing which generates distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Such emissions are also recordable from tympanal organs of insects. In vertebrates (including humans), otoacoustic emissions are considered by-products of active sound amplification through specialized sensory receptor cells in the inner ear. Force generated by these cells primarily augments the displacement amplitude of the basilar membrane and thus increases auditory sensitivity. As in vertebrates, the emissions from insect ears are based on nonlinear mechanical properties of the sense organ. Apparently, to achieve maximum sensitivity, convergent evolutionary principles have been realized in the micromechanics of these hearing organs-although vertebrates and insects possess quite different types of receptor cells in their ears. Just as in vertebrates, otoacoustic emissions from insects ears are vulnerable and depend on an intact metabolism, but so far in tympanal organs, it is not clear if auditory nonlinearity is achieved by active motility of the sensory neurons or if passive cellular characteristics cause the nonlinear behavior. In the antennal ears of flies and mosquitoes, however, active vibrations of the flagellum have been demonstrated. Our review concentrates on experiments studying the tympanal organs of grasshoppers and moths; we show that their otoacoustic emissions are produced in a frequency-specific way and can be modified by electrical stimulation of the sensory cells. Even the simple ears of notodontid moths produce distinct emissions, although they have just one auditory neuron. At present it is still uncertain, both in vertebrates and in insects, if the nonlinear amplification so essential for sensitive sound processing is primarily due to motility of the somata of specialized sensory cells or to active movement of their (stereo-)cilia. We anticipate that further experiments with the relatively simple ears of insects will help answer these questions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s00359-008-0344-0
Methodology of dynamic actuation for flexible magnetic actuator and biomimetic robotics application,133,"Recently, materials and locomotion control methods of micro robot have been developed for applying to the biomedical application. Especially, many researches of biomimetics locomotion and magnetic actuators have been introduced. In this paper, we introduced methodology of dynamic actuation of the flexible magnetic actuator so as to drive micro robot. Proposed methodology presents both static motion and dynamic motion by correlation between the magnetic moment and the rotating magnetic field. This method can provide much more active movement than the general control method of ac and dc magnetic field.

Brainstem processing of vestibular sensory exafference: Implications for motion sickness etiology,134,"The origin of the internal ""sensory conflict"" stimulus causing motion sickness has been debated for more than four decades. Recent studies show a subclass of neurons in the vestibular nuclei and deep cerebellar nuclei that respond preferentially to passive head movements. During active movement, the semicircular canal and otolith input (""reafference"") to these neurons are canceled by a mechanism comparing the expected consequences of self-generated movement (estimated with an internal model-presumably located in the cerebellum) with the actual sensory feedback. The un-canceled component (""exafference"") resulting from passive movement normally helps compensate for unexpected postural disturbances. Notably, the existence of such vestibular ""sensory conflict"" neurons had been postulated as early as 1982, but their existence and putative role in posture control and motion sickness have been long debated. Here, we review the development of ""sensory conflict"" theories in relation to recent evidence for brainstem and cerebellar reafference cancelation, and identify some open research questions. We propose that conditions producing persistent activity of these neurons, or their targets, stimulate nearby brainstem emetic centers-via an as yet unidentified mechanism. We discuss how such a mechanism is consistent with the notable difference in motion sickness susceptibility of drivers as opposed to passengers, human immunity to normal self-generated movement and why head restraint or lying horizontal confers relative immunity. Finally, we propose that fuller characterization of these mechanisms and their potential role in motion sickness could lead to more effective, scientifically based prevention and treatment for motion sickness. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,review. brain-centered,,10.1007/s00221-014-3973-2
Functional properties of monkey motor cortex neurones receiving afferent input from the hand and fingers,135,"1. Records have been made from area 4 of the cerebral cortex in five conscious monkeys. The properties of 216 neurones responsive to natural stimulation of the hand and fingers have been investigated. 2. 46% of these neurones responded only to cutaneous stimulation (especially light brushing across the glabrous skin) and a further 38% responded only to movement of the digits. 4% responded to brief prods of the hand. 12% of the sample responded to more than one stimulus modality. 3. Many hand‐input neurones, including pyramidal tract neurones, responded at short‐latency (8‐15 msec) to light mechanical stimulation of the hand and to weak electrical stimulation of the median nerve. 4. Responsive neurones were found at all depths of the cortical grey matter. Responses of shortest latency were encountered in neurones probably located in layers IV and V. 5. The behaviour of eighty hand‐input neurones was analysed during a simple, stereotyped task which involved pulling a lever and collecting a food reward from a small well. For comparison, the activity of 117 neurones with inputs from the wrist, elbow or shoulder was also analysed. 6. Nearly all hand‐input neurones modulated their activity either before (48/80) or during (29/80) the retrieval of the reward which required precision grip between index finger and thumb. Many were silent during proximal arm movements and some displayed activity patterns independent of these movements. 7. By contrast, the activity of many neurones with proximal arm (elbow, shoulder) inputs was unrelated to food retrieval and manipulation, but well related to arm movements. 8. Forty‐three of the eighty neurones had cutaneous input from the hand. Twenty‐seven were active before hand contact. Thirty‐five modulated their discharge when contact was made (twenty‐one excitation, fourteen inhibition). 9. Most hand‐input neurones were more active during fractionated movements of the hand or fingers than during power or ball grips requiring simultaneous flexion of all digits. Neurones with glabrous inputs often showed intense activity during small, precise finger movements and during active tactile exploration without the aid of vision. 10. Analysis of the discharge frequency of twenty‐five hand‐input neurones revealed that some (mainly non‐pyramidal tract neurones) had a similar mean frequency and range of modulation during both active movement and passive stimulation. Others (mainly pyramidal tract neurones) had a greater frequency range and higher mean frequency during active than during passive movements. © 1981 The Physiological Society",,,,,,,,10.1113/jphysiol.1981.sp013601

An investigation of the effect of continuous passive motion and lower limb passive movement on heart rate in normal volunteers,137,"Previous studies have indicated that passive movement of the lower limb may affect cardiopulmonary function via a neuronal reflex activated by afferent inputs from articular receptors. This study compared the effect of lower limb continuous passive motion, lower limb passive movement and lower limb active movement on heart rate in normal volunteers. These techniques are used extensively by physiotherapists in clinical practice. A knowledge of the influence of these techniques on cardiac function should be an important factor in designing maintenance programmes for patients with cardiovascular disorders. The study shows that while lower limb active movement has a significant effect on heart rate, lower limb passive movement and lower limb continuous passive motion produce only a small increase in heart rate. This suggests that lower limb passive motion and continuous passive motion are techniques which may be safely used as a means of maintaining lower limb range of movement and function in the treatment of patients whose cardiovascular system is compromised, although further study is necessary to establish that such patients respond similarly. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,,,,,not effect on perception,10.3109/09593989309036481

Design: Open-label extension to a double-blind study. Setting: Phase III, international, multicenter. Participants: 258 patients consisting of 227 rollover patients who completed a double-blind study (Gracies, et al. Lancet Neurol. 2015) and 31 de novo patients. Interventions: AbobotulinumtoxinA 500U, 1000U or 1500U (selected and adapted by investigator) for up to 4/5 cycles. Main Outcome Measures: Spasticity (Tardieu Scale: passive range of motion [XV1] and angle of catch [XV3]), active range of motion in the primary target muscle group (PTMG: finger, wrist or elbow flexors), active function (Modified Frenchay Scale, MFS [assessed by videotaping patients' performance of ten tasks using the upper limb, scored by independent observer) and safety assessments. Results (mean change (SD) from baseline) are provided irrespective of dose (500U, 1000U, 1500U) administered. Results: Passive range of motion and angle of catch improved over repeated cycles in the three PTMGs. The increase of active finger extension of +19.8° (28.8) seen at Week 4 in the double-blind phase nearly doubled to +38.0° (53.4) in cycle 4 of the open-label phase. A progressive improvement over cycles was also broadly observed for wrist and elbow extension. Upper limb active function (MFS) improved progressively over cycles: the increase of +0.21 (0.53) observed at Week 4 of the double-blind phase reached +0.40 (0.75) at Week 4 of cycle 4. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events decreased over repeated cycles from 41.5% in the double-blind study to 13.6% in cycle 4 of the open-label phase. Conclusions: Over repeated cycles of abobotulinumtoxinA injections, improvements of spasticity and active movements were observed; this was associated with a progressive improvement in active function.

Perceptual and motor effects of agonist-antagonist muscle vibration in man,139,"Perceptual and motor effects of vibration applied simultaneously to the distal tendons of the Biceps and Triceps muscles, in isometric conditions and without sight of the stimulated arm, have been studied in human volunteers. Motor effects, measured by surface EMG, are inexistent when the flexor and extensor muscles are simultaneously vibrated at the same frequency. However, EMG activity appears in the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency when simultaneous vibration is applied at different frequencies. The sensations felt by the subjects were reproduced by the nonvibrated arm and recorded by a goniometer. The studies show that the velocity and the amplitude of the ilusory movement is related to the difference in vibration frequency applied to the two muscles. The direction of movement felt (flexion or extension) is that produced by shortening of the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency. When the two vibration frequencies are the same, there is either no sensation of movement, or a sensation of very slow movement. These results support the notion that the sensation of movement at a joint may be derived from a central processing of the proprioceptive inflow data obtained from flexor and extensor muscles. This interpretation may also be valid for the results obtained earlier by vibration of a single muscle. Furthermore, it is coherent with data on spindle afferent fibres obtained by microneurography in man during passive or active movements. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF00239528
[Mutual influences of upper and lower extrimities during cyclic movements].,140,"The possibility of muscle activation of passive arm during its cyclic movements, imposed by active movements of contralateral arm or by experimenter was studied, as well as the influence of lower extremities cyclic movements onto arm muscles activity. In addition to that the activity of legs muscles was estimated in dependence on motor task condition for arms. Ten healthy supine subjects carried out opposite movements of arms with and without stepping-like movements of both legs. The experiment included three conditions for arm movements: 1) the active movements of both arms; 2) the active movements of one arm, when other entirely passive arm participated in the movement by force; 3) passive arm movement caused by experimenter. In the condition 2) additional load on active arm was applied (30 N and 60 N). In all three conditions the experiment was carried out with arms movements only or together with legs movements. The capability of passive moving arm muscles activation depended on increasing afferent inflow from muscles of contralateral arm was demonstrated. Emerging electrical activity was modulated in the arms movements cycle and depended on the degree of active arm loading. During combined active movements of arms and legs the reduction of activity in the flexor muscles of shoulder and forearm was observed. Concomitant arms movements increased the magnitude ofelectromiographic bursts during passive stepping-like movements in the most of recorded muscles, and the same increasing was only observed in biceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscles during active legs movement. The increasing of loading of one arm caused essential augmentation of EMG-activity in the majority of recording legs muscles.

Spinal fractures: a clinico-radiographic approach,141,"Purpose:  To review the radiology of spinal fractures and purpose seed clinical pathways for determining the appropriateness of radiology of spinal trauma patients likely to present in chiropractic offices.  Implications of appropriateness and timing of manipulation in spinal fractures are discussed.  Method:  A qualitative literature review was conducted, supplemented with clinical case review from files at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic Radiology Department.  Summary:  Peak incidence of spinal fracture occurs in the young adult population with a male prevalence.  However, females are predisposed to spinal fracture in the older population.  The lumbosacral spine is the most frequent site for spinal fracture and is usually associated with falls and motor vehicle accidents.  The nature of fracture is likely to induce characteristic changes in the anterior, middle and posterior spinal column regions, serving as a guide for evaluating the radiograph.  Adjustive methods may be appropriate in the posttraumatic therapeutic regimen depending on the nature and severity of trauma, the degree of healing, the amount of initial and residual deformation, and the neurologic status of the patient.

Cortical neuromagnetic fields evoked by voluntary and passive hand movements in healthy adults,142,"Neuromagnetic fields were recorded from the left cerebral hemisphere of six healthy right-handed subjects under three different conditions: (1) externally triggered rapid voluntary extension and flexion of the right hand, (2) passive extension and flexion of the right hand, and (3) stimulation of the skin of the right index finger by means of air pressure. Location analysis using the current density analysis did not reveal any differences between motor evoked field I (MEF I) in active and passive movements, and met the maximum of cerebral activation in the contralateral precentral region. In contrast, the sensory evoked field was located clearly in the contralateral postcentral region. Additionally, a significantly shorter latency of MEF I (with respect to movement onset) was observed in flexion compared with extension in both passive and active movements. These results support the assumption that MEF I is generated by cortical activation resulting from proprioceptive, probably muscle spindle, input.

The human horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex in response to active and passive head impulses after unilateral vestibular deafferentation,143,"We studied the compensatory eye movements made by subjects with unilateral vestibular deficits in response to passive (unpredictable, manually generated) and active (predictable, self-generated) head impulses. A typical head impulse is a brief, low-amplitude (15-20°), high-velocity (150-350°/s), high-acceleration (4000-6000°/s2), yaw head-on-trunk rotation. In the initial 75 ms of the response, the vestlbulo-ocular reflex gain was significantly higher during active head impulses to both ipsilesional and contralesional sides, than during passive impulses. Mean gains were 0.15 (ipsilesional passive), 0.44 (ipsilesional active), 0.5 (contralesional passive), and 0.76 (contralesional active). Differences between active and passive head impulses were present from near the onset of head rotation. The mechanism for producing this behavior is unclear, but the findings could be related to enhanced sensitivity of second-order neurons during active head impulses. However, even with active movements, there is still a large and statistically significant asymmetry in the eye-movement responses for ipsilesional as opposed to contralesional head rotations. After 75 ms, rapid corrective eye movements often were generated to reduce any remaining gaze error.",,,,,,,,10.1196/annals.1303.030
Fluid secretion by the Malpighian tubules of insects,144,"Malpighian tubules of insects typically secrete an iso-osmotic fluid by a process which is thought to involve the following: (1) Potassium ions enter the tubule cells by a process which is sodium dependent and which may be active; they are then actively pumped into the lumen by an electrogenic pump. (2) Sodium ions cross the wall in a similar fashion to potassium ions but their entry into the cells is very restricted so that they are transported only slowly. (3) These active cation movements create a trans-wall potential favouring the passive movements of anions from the haemolymph into the lumen. (4) With one exception, smaller anions appear to cross the wall faster than do larger ones. The exception is that phosphate ions cross faster than any other anion in spite of their large size. The evidence suggests that this is more likely to be achieved by facilitated diffusion but active movements are not excluded. (5) The apical and basal membranes of the tubule cells are elaborately folded. It is suggested that these foldings act to couple movement of water to the movements of ions by allowing the development of standing osmotic gradients. (6) Such gradients will be small because the channels in which they occur are short. However, as the cell membranes probably have a high osmotic permeability water is likely to be able osmotically to equilibrate with the channel contents to produce an iso-somotic secretion. (7) The folds in the cell membrane are such that a parallel array of channels alternately opening to the cytoplasm and to the extracellular fluid is produced. Such an arrangement leads to a steeper osmotic gradient across the cell wall and this will promote a more efficient coupling of solute and water movements.",,,,,,,,10.1098/rstb.1971.0089
Clinical assessment of spasticity in children,145,"Spasticity is a common disorder in patients with injury of the brain and spinal cord. Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of spasticity in children. Around 80% of patients with CP are affected by spasticity. Other pediatric disorders that cause spasticity include traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, encephalitis, meningitis and various neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. Spasticity is a term frequently used beyond its definition to describe muscle over activity associated with weakness, hyperreflexia and other signs of the upper motor neuron syndrome. The definition of spasticity has been simplified to describe an increase in velocity dependent muscle stretch reflexes (Lance, 1980). Patients affected by spasticity may also have other manifestations of muscle over activity (i.e., abnormal coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles, spastic dystonia, etc.) that along with paresis and soft tissue contracture cause motor impairment. Muscle over activity is particularly important to be recognized and assessed by the clinician since it can be effectively treated. Clinical assessment of spasticity includes: identification of the impairment and differentiation from other types of hypertonia, measurement of spasticity, and assessment of the impact of spasticity on function, care and quality of life. A sub-group of investigators of the NIH Taskforce on Childhood Motor Disorders developed the HAT, a seven-item clinical assessment tool to help differentiate different types of pediatric hypertonia. The HAT proved to have good test re-test and inter-rater reliability as well as validity for identification of spasticity (Fehlings, et al). Spasticity is generally assessed by passively moving a joint to grade muscular resistance, using e.g. the Ashworth Scale (AS) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). These clinical assessments have been criticized for incorrectly measuring spasticity due to their inability to differentiate neural from non-neural components and for their poor reliability when assessing lower limb spasticity. More consistent with Lance's definition of spasticity are the Tardieu Scale (TS) and the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS). These measures have been found to be more valid and reliable than the AS and MAS. Standardization and proper training have the potential of increasing the reliability and clinical value of these scales. Objective, quantitative and robust measurements are thus crucial for the accurate evaluation of spasticity and treatment efficacy. Several instrumented approaches have been suggested which can be categorized as biomechanical, neurophysiologic and integrated. Biomechanical approaches capture the behavior of muscles by measuring joint position, angular velocity and torque (reactive-resistance) during well-defined movements. Isokinetic devices displace a limb at a controlled velocity and have been used to measure limb resistance to passive movement. However, these are often bulky and difficult to apply for children. Smaller, manually controlled dynamometers have similar reproducibility and are clinically more feasible. Neurophysiologic approaches investigate the muscles' electrical activity in reaction to e.g. passive and active movements, generally using surface electromyography (sEMG). These are considered more valid than the clinical scales and sEMG has been used to identify different spasticity patterns. However, when used in isolation, the electrophysiological approaches provide no information about reactive-resistance. An integrated approach considers both neurophysiologic and biomechanical methods. So far, hardly any measurement that fully integrates multidimensional signals is clinically feasible and few have been assessed for reliability. It is commonly assumed that there is a causal relationship between spasticity, activity limitation, participation and independence. In some cases however, spasticity may not only not interfere with function, it may actually enhance it; in others, although it may not interfere with function, if left untreated, complications may later arise. Without a better understanding and valid and reliable assessment methods, progress towards better treatment and management of spasticity and associated phenomena are hampered.",,,,,,,,
Directional tuning of human forearm muscle afferents during voluntary wrist movements,146,"1. Single unit activity was recorded with the microneurography technique from sixteen spindle afferents and one Golgi tendon organ afferent originating from the forearm extensor muscles. Impulse rates were studied while subjects performed unobstructed aiming movements at the wrist in eight different directions 45 deg apart. In addition, similar imposed movements were performed while the subject was instructed to remain relaxed. Movement amplitudes were about 5 deg and the speed 10-30 deg s-1. Joint movements were translated to movements of a cursor on a monitor to provide visual feedback. 2. Individual spindle afferents modulated their activity over a number of targets, i.e. were broadly tuned, during these aiming movements. The preferred direction for a spindle afferent was the same during both passive and active movements, indicating that the fusimotor effects associated with active contractions had little or no effect on the direction of tuning. 3. The direction of tuning of individual spindle afferents could be predicted from the biomechanically inferred length changes of the parent muscle. Thus spindle afferents responded as stretch receptors, i.e. impulse rates increased with lengthening and decreased with shortening, in active as well as passive movements. 4. Spindles from muscles, which continuously counteracted gravity exhibited a stretch response and directional tuning during the phase of movement alone whereas their position sensitivity was poor. In contrast, spindle afferents from the muscles that had no or minimal antigravity role were directionally tuned during both the dynamic and the static phase of the aiming task and their position sensitivity was substantially higher. 5. In spite of the limited data base from three extensor muscles it could be demonstrated that wrist joint position was remarkably well encoded in the ensemble muscle spindle data. In some cases the ensemble muscle spindle data encoded the instantaneous trajectory of movement as well.",,,,,,,,10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0635c.xd
Antennal Movements and Mechanoreception: Neurobiology of Active Tactile Sensors,147,"The tactile sense provides animals with vital information about their immediate environment, comprising cues on object location and surface properties. In insects and other arthropods, the antennae are probably the most important part of this tactile sense. The paired insect antenna is regarded as a true, segmented limb arising from the cranium, although there is still some debate about the precise number of segments in the head of the Mandibulata (Crustacea, Myriapoda and Insecta; Schmidt-Ott and Technau, 1992; Schmidt-Ott et al., 1994; Damen et al., 1998; Abzhanov and Kaufman, 1999; Boyan and Williams, 2002). Hennig (1986) uses the name Antennata as a synonym for the Mandibulata, expressing the fact that this taxon comprises all living arthropod species with antennae. The most ancient arthropods, the extinct trilobites, also carried antennae, which is why the 1st pair of antennae is typically considered to be the first pair of limbs, i.e. articulated appendages, in the ground plan of all arthropods. Accordingly, the Chelicerata are thought to have secondarily lost their antennae. Within the Mandibulata, the Crustacea carry two pairs of antennae: the antennules (first pair) are appendages of the deutocerebral segment and are considered to be homologous to the insect antenna, whereas the second pair of antennae are the appendages of the so-called tritocerebral segment (Hennig, 1986; Brusca and Brusca, 1990; Telford and Thomas, 1998; Boyan et al., 2002). Insects have lost the second pair of antennae during evolution. Antennae are equipped with various types of mechanoreceptors, including large numbers of exteroreceptive sensory hairs, but also proprioreceptors such as internal chordotonal organs, external hair plates, and campaniform sensilla. Being moveable, the antennae can actively sample the space surrounding the animal, thus aiding the localisation of obstacles, recognition of conspecifics or predators, active tracking of objects, or probing of surface structures. Because both passive and active movements can occur during tactile sensing, the tactile sensory system requires integration of proprioreceptive and exteroreceptive information in order to locate the stimulus source. Moreover, self-induced sensory stimulation may have to be predicted from motor commands, and compared with the actual sensory input. Therefore, understanding the neurobiology of the tactile sense of insects and crustaceans requires an integrative view of the motor physiology and biomechanics on the one hand, and of the neurophysiology of the participating sensory and interneuronal structures on the other. In the light of this knowledge, the functional significance of the various system components can be interpreted for a range of natural behaviours. The last integrative view on insect antennae that included all known sensory modalities was given by Schneider (1964). Since then, much progress has been made, not only in the field of insect olfaction (e.g. Hansson, 1999) and the sensory physiology of mechanoreceptors (e.g. McIver, 1975, 1985; Zacharuk, 1985), but also in elucidating key components in tactile behaviours such as the localisation of obstacles or physical interactions in intraspecific communication. To illustrate this body of knowledge, and to extend and contrast the mentioned reports on mechanoreception, it is the aim of the present review to combine aspects of antennal biomechanics, mechanoreception, processing of tactile information, and the behavioural repertoire involving the antennal tactile sense. Each of these aspects will be treated in separate sections, concentrating on prominent animal model systems, such as the cockroach (mainly Periplaneta americana L. and Blaberus sp.), stick insect (Carausius morosus Br.), cricket (Gryllus sp., Teleogryllus sp. and Acheta domesticus L.), locust (Locusta migratoria L. and Schistocerca gregaria Forskål) and the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). For comparison with a related animal group that employs very similar, though not homologous, organs in tactile sensing, we will expand our view on decapod crustaceans, notably crayfish and lobsters. Finally, we discuss the potential of active tactile sensing from a technical perspective, to point at a helpful mutual exchange between engineering and animal physiology. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Spontaneous tendon rupture as a rare side effect of statin use,148,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1. Recognize the clinical presentation of tendinopathy/tendon rupture 2. Identify rare adverse reactions of statin therapy CASE INFORMATION: A 61 year-old male presented to the emergency department with excruciating pain in his right knee. On the morning of presentation, he developed sudden onset of stabbing pain in his right knee along with a sudden popping sound while bending down to pick up a newspaper. He was unable to bear weight and fell to the floor. He was essentially asymptomatic prior to this event and denied any preceding trauma or excessive muscular strain. Medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus 2 and hypercholesterolemia. On examination, there was swelling in the suprapatellar region of his right knee associated with ecchymosis. He was unable to perform a straight leg raise and active extension of his right knee. Passive movements in both the knees and active movements in the left knee were normal. Hip examination was normal. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the knees showed thickening of the quadriceps tendon on the right and normal findings on the left. A non-contrast MRI of his right knee showed a tear of his right vastus lateralis tendon with mild retraction. The patient underwent successful open vastus lateralis tendon repair of his right knee. On review of his medications, the only potential etiological agent was simvastatin which he had been taking for the past three years. He denied use of fluoroquinolones, steroids or any other offending agents in the preceding three years. Post-operatively, he had not taken simvastatin for 3 weeks and had no musculoskeletal symptoms. Following discharge, he restarted his simvastatin therapy and weeks later developed pain in the area of the left quadriceps tendon. However, there was no clinical evidence of any rupture and was able to bear weight despite the pain. Given his recent medical history and the known but rare association of tendinopathy with statin use, he was recommended discontinuation of statin therapy. At three month follow-up, he was asymptomatic and had no recurrent symptoms. IMPLICATIONS/DISCUSSION: Iatrogenic, non-traumatic causes of tendon rupture include steroid and flouroquinolone use. Statins are associated with a multitude of musculoskeletal complaints of which myopathy is the most frequent. Tendinopathy and tendon rupture are very rare but reported adverse effects of statin use. The present report describes a quadriceps tendon rupture during simvastatin therapy and contralateral symptoms of quadriceps tendinopathy on rechallenge. The lack of other causative factors, the temporal relation and reproducibility of symptoms on rechallenge support the causative role of statin therapy in our patient. The exact etiology of statin induced tendinopathy and tendon rupture remain unclear. However, proposed mechanisms include statin induced suppression of matrix metalloproteinase and prostaglandin E2 activity. This leads to impaired tendon remodeling and potentially to weakening and rupture. As the prevalence of hyperlipidemia and the prescription of statins continue to increase, it is imperative that physicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of such rare and potentially disabling side effects.",,,,,,,,
Functional Head Impulse Testing Might Be Useful for Assessing Vestibular Compensation After Unilateral Vestibular Loss,149,"Background: Loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) affects visual acuity during head movements. Previous studies have shown that compensatory eye-saccades improve visual acuity and that the timing of the saccade is important. Most of the tests involved in testing VOR are made with passive head movement, that do not necessarily reflect the activities of daily living and thus not being proportionate to symptoms and distresses of the patients. Objective: To examine differences between active (self-generated) or passive (imposed by the examiner) head rotations while trying to maintain visual focus on a target. Method: Nine subjects with unilateral total vestibular loss were recruited (4 men and 5 women, mean age 47) and tested with video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and Head Impulse Testing Device-Functional Test (HITD-FT) during passive and active movements while looking at a target. VOR gain, latencies of covert saccades, frequency of covert saccades and visual acuity were measured and analyzed. Results: Active head-impulses toward the lesioned side resulted in better visual acuity (p = 0.002) compared to conventional passive head-impulses and generated eye-saccades with significantly shorter latencies (p = 0.004). Active movements to the lesioned side generated dynamic visual acuities that were as good as when testing the intact side. Conclusion: Actively generated head impulses resulted in normal dynamic visual acuity, even when performed toward the side of total vestibular loss. This might be attributed to the appearance of short-latency covert saccades. The results show a strong relationship between self-generated movements, latencies of covert saccades and outcome in HITD-FT, i.e., a better dynamic visual function with less retinal slip which is the main function of the VOR. The method of active HITD-FT might be valuable in assessing vestibular compensation and monitoring ongoing vestibular rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fneur.2018.00979
Layer-specific touch-dependent facilitation and depression in the somatosensory cortex during active whisking,151,"Brains adapt to new situations by retuning their neurons. The most common form of neuronal adaptation, typically observed with repetitive stimulations of passive sensory organs, is depression (responses gradually decrease until stabilized). We studied cortical adaptation when stimuli are acquired by active movements of the sensory organ. In anesthetized rats, artificial whisking was induced at 5 Hz, and activity of individual neurons in layers 2-5 was recorded during whisking in air (Whisking condition) and whisking against an object (Touch condition). Response strengths were assessed by spike counts. Input-layer responses (layers 4 and 5a) usually facilitated during the whisking train, whereas superficial responses (layer 2/3) usually depressed. In layers 2/3 and 4, but not 5a, responses were usually stronger during touch trials than during whisking in air. Facilitations were specific to the protraction phase; during retraction, responses depressed in all layers and conditions. These dynamic processes were accompanied by a slow positive wave of activity progressing from superficial to deeper layers and lasting for ∼1 s, during the transient phase of response. Our results indicate that, in the cortex, adaptation does not depend only on the level of activity or the frequency of its repetition but rather on the nature of the sensory information that is conveyed by that activity and on the processing layer. The input and laminar specificities observed here are consistent with the hypothesis that the paralemniscal layer 5a is involved in the processing of whisker motion, whereas the lemniscal barrels in layer 4 are involved in the processing of object identity.

Corticokinematic coherence during active and passive finger movements,152,"Corticokinematic coherence (CKC) refers to coupling between magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain activity and hand kinematics. For voluntary hand movements, CKC originates mainly from the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex. To learn about the relative motor and sensory contributions to CKC, we recorded CKC from 15 healthy subjects during active and passive right index-finger movements. The fingertip was either touching or not touching table, resulting in active-touch, active-no-touch, passive-touch, and passive-no-touch conditions. The kinematics of the index-finger was measured with a 3-axis accelerometer. Beamformer analysis was used to locate brain activations for the movements; somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs) elicited by pneumatic tactile stimulation of the index finger served as a functional landmark for cutaneous input. All active and passive movements resulted in statistically significant CKC at the movement frequency (F0) and its first harmonic (F1). The main CKC sources at F0 and F1 were in the contralateral SM1 cortex with no spatial differences between conditions, and distinct from the SEF sources. At F1, the coherence was by two thirds stronger for passive than active movements, with no difference between touch vs. no-touch conditions. Our results suggest that the CKC occurring during repetitive finger movements is mainly driven by somatosensory, primarily proprioceptive, afferent input to the SM1 cortex, with negligible effect of cutaneous input. © 2013 IBRO.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.02.002
PROGRESSIVE PROPRIOCEPTION EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION FOR CHRONIC ANKLE INSTABILITY.,153,"The article focuses on the use of progressive proprioception exercises for the rehabilitation of athletes with chronic ankle instability.

Predictive perception of self-generated movements: Commonalities and differences in the neural processing of tool and hand actions,154,"Tool use is one of the most remarkable skills of the human species, enabling complex interactions with the environment. To establish such interactions, we predict the sensory consequences of our actions based on a copy of the motor command (efference copy), leading to an attenuated perception and neural suppression of the sensory input. Here, we investigated whether and how tools can be incorporated into these predictions. We hypothesized that similar predictive mechanisms are used for both hand and tool use actions, but that additional resources are needed to integrate the tool. During fMRI data acquisition, 19 healthy participants used either their right hand or a tool to hold the handle of a movement device. To manipulate the effect of the efference copy, the handle was moved either actively by participants or passively by the movement device. The sensory outcome, consisting of a real-time video of the hand or tool movement shown on a screen, was presented with varying delays (0–417 ms). Participants reported their perception of such delays. The processing of hand and tool movements yielded largely similar results when comparing active against passive conditions: Active movements were in both cases associated with worse delay detection performances. Moreover, during both hand and tool use actions, active movements led to a downregulation of sensory (somatosensory, visual) areas as well as the right cerebellum and right posterior parietal cortex, as assessed by a conjunction analysis. By contrast, an interaction analysis indicated differential processing of active vs. passive movements in hand vs. tool conditions in the left postcentral gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and bilateral caudate nuclei. Our findings provide behavioral and neural support that hand and tool actions share similar mechanisms for sensory predictions. We propose that the MTG and (sensori)motor areas (postcentral gyrus, caudate nuclei) contribute to these predictions by optimizing them to the physics of the end effector (hand or tool). Collectively, these results suggest that the brain dynamically adjusts sensorimotor predictive models to anticipate the dynamics of the end effector, be it a hand or a tool.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116309
Mechanism for rapid passive-dynamic prey capture in a pitcher plant,155,"Plants use rapid movements to disperse seed, spores, or pollen and catch animal prey. Most rapid-release mechanisms only work once and, if repeatable, regaining the prerelease state is a slow and costly process. We present an encompassing mechanism for a rapid, repeatable, passive-dynamic motion used by a carnivorous pitcher plant to catch prey. Nepenthes gracilis uses the impact of rain drops to catapult insects from the underside of the canopy-like pitcher lid into the fluid-filled trap below. High-speed video and laser vibrometry revealed that the lid acts as a torsional spring system, driven by rain drops. During the initial downstroke, the tip of the lid reached peak velocities similar to fast animal motions and an order of magnitude faster than the snap traps of Venus flytraps and catapulting tentacles of the sundew Drosera glanduligera. In contrast to these active movements, the N. gracilis lid oscillation requires neither mechanical preloading nor metabolic energy, and its repeatability is only limited by the intensity and duration of rainfall. The underside of the lid is coated with friction-reducing wax crystals, making insects more vulnerable to perturbations. We show that the trapping success of N. gracilis relies on the combination of material stiffness adapted for momentum transfer and the antiadhesive properties of the wax crystal surface. The impact-driven oscillation of the N. gracilis lid represents a new kind of rapid plant movement with adaptive function. Our findings establish the existence of a continuum between active and passive trapping mechanisms in carnivorous plants.",,,,,,,,10.1073/pnas.1510060112
Pain relief by various kinds of interference stimulation applied to the peripheral skin in humans: pain-related brain potentials following CO2 laser stimulation.,156,"Pain perception is changed by various kinds of interference stimulation applied to the peripheral skin in humans. We investigated pain-related somatosensory evoked brain potentials (pain SEPs) following CO2 laser stimulation applied to the hand or foot in normal subjects, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. A pain visual analogue scale (VAS) was also scored to determine the degree of subjective feeling of painful sensation. The following stimulations were applied as the interference: (1) vibration, (2) active and passive movements of the hand or foot, (3) noxious warming by hot water (46 degrees C) and (4) noxious cooling by ice water (0 degrees C). These interference stimulations were applied not only to the same hand or foot as the laser stimuli but also to the contralateral hand or foot. Significant changes in the amplitude of pain SEPs and VAS score were observed to some degree for each type of interference, and we concluded that gate control theory and diffuse noxious inhibitory control were the most appropriate hypotheses to account for this particular phenomenon of pain relief. Some movement-related cortical activities were also considered to be an important factor. These findings could not be accounted for by simple changes in the subjects' attention. Pain relief was more prominent at the second pain ascending through C fibers than that of the first pain ascending through Adelta fibers. The responsible sites for this phenomenon are considered to be the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the brainstem and some parts of the brain such as the second sensory cortex and the cingulate cortex.",,,,,,,,
Functional linkages between motor cortical cells and elbow flexor muscles. Evidence for and characteristics of postspike facilitation,157,"1. Two monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) making high-level but submaximal isometric flexions of the elbow were investigated for the output effect of motor cortical cells on the electromyogram (EMG) activity of two main elbow flexors using the method of spike-triggered averaging of rectified EMGs (STAs). 2. Monkeys were trained to perform individual isometric contractions for >2 s, and two series of ≥20 contractions, the second series being at a greater force. EMG electrodes pairs were implanted in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis. A total of 257 cortical cells were found that discharged with the active and passive movements of the elbow. We examined the EMG postspike facilitations (PSFs) produced in either one or the two flexors for only those cells that discharged during the isometric contraction, and provoked PSFs in the two series of contractions. 3. The main characteristics of the EMG isometric contractions in the agonists were analyzed. Spectral analysis showed that the increases in the EMG median frequency with force stabilized at the force levels performed by monkeys. Cross correlation methods showed no cross talk between agonists. 4. The 26 selected cortical cells had a regular discharge frequency. Ten cells did not change frequency with a 22-30% force increase, 14 cells discharged at a higher frequency, and 2 cells discharged at a lower frequency. For single-cell frequencies of 565 Hz, interspike intervals <10 ms were rare: the median and modal intervals were 20-30 ms. 5. The significance of PSFs with respect to the EMG background noise was estimated statistically. STAs from successive epochs under identical load conditions, and STAs performed at a distance from the trigger, showed that PSFs were authentic postspike effects and not sudden EMG changes synchronized by chance with the triggering cell. The features distinguishing PSF from secondary postspike EMG changes or coactivation and task-related effects were studied in simultaneous STAs of flexors and autocorrelogram of cortical spikes. 6. The magnitude of the PSF was expressed as the percent peak amplitude above the mean EMG baseline. The mean percent amplitude of the 90 PSFs produced in both muscles and series was 4.0 ± 2.4% (mean ± SD). There was no difference in the average amplitude of PSFs in the two flexors, although the baseline voltages in the biceps brachii were higher. Neither was there any significant change with force while the baseline level increased by 29 ± 10%, indicating that the absolute PSF amplitude increased in the same proportion as baseline. 7. The mean onset latency was 9.4 ± 4.2 ms for all PSFs, but it was 6.9 ± 1.8 ms for two thirds of the PSFs. The differences in flexors were not significant. There was a weak correlation between the PSF amplitudes and latencies. 8. Nineteen cells cofacilitated the two flexors. Fifteen cells facilitated the two flexors at the same latency within a 4-ms range at each force level, and 11 did it for the two levels of force. 9. We conclude that motor cortical cells exert an excitatory effect on elbow flexor muscles via monosynaptic or disynaptic linkages.",,,,,,,,10.1152/jn.1995.74.1.130
Physiological effects of selective tibial neurotomy on lower limb spasticity,158,"Objectives. To assess by electrophysiology the effect of tibial selective neurotomy on muscle imbalance of the spastic ankle. Method. The amplitudes of the H reflexes, M responses (muscle contractions recorded after stimulation of the tibial nerve), and Hmax:Mmax ratio were recorded in 12 patients with chronic lower limb spasticity, before and one month after tibial selective neurotomy. Recordings were done on medial and lateral gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Clinical evaluation was done with both global (Held's score) and analytical tests (step measurements, gait velocity, and ankle angulation during active and passive movements). Results. After neurotomy, gait improved in all patients. Held's score of spasticity was better in all patients. Active dorsiflexion of the ankle was unchanged in three patients, but the others improved by 5°to 12°. Hmax, Mmax, and Hmax:Mmax ratios were lower. The Hmax on the gastrocnemius muscle, clinical strength, Mmax of all the muscles, and Hmax:Mmax ratio for the soleus and lateral gastrocnemius muscle were significantly lower after surgery. Conclusion. There was an improvement of clinical and electrophysiological spastic indices after selective tibial neurotomy. Neurotomy acted not only on motor neurons by decreasing strength, but also the reflex enlargement by decreasing sensory afferents.",,,,,,,,10.1136/jnnp.63.5.575
Somatotopic organization in the internal segment of the globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease,160,"Ablation or deep brain stimulation in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is an effective therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet many patients receive only partial benefit, including varying levels of improvement across different body regions, which may relate to a differential effect of GPi surgery on the different body regions. Unfortunately, our understanding of the somatotopic organization of human GPi is based on a small number of studies with limited sample sizes, including several based upon only a single recording track or plane. To fully address the three-dimensional somatotopic organization of GPi, we examined the receptive field properties of pallidal neurons in a large cohort of patients undergoing stereotactic surgery. The response of neurons to active and passive movements of the limbs and orofacial structures was determined, using a minimum of three tracks across at least two medial-lateral planes. Neurons (3183) were evaluated from 299 patients, of which 1972 (62%) were modulated by sensorimotor manipulation. Of these, 1767 responded to a single, contralateral body region, with the remaining 205 responding to multiple and/or ipsilateral body regions. Leg-related neurons were found dorsal, medial and anterior to arm-related neurons, while arm-related neurons were dorsal and lateral to orofacial-related neurons. This study provides a more detailed map of individual body regions as well as specific joints within each region and provides a potential explanation for the differential effect of lesions or DBS of the GPi on different body parts in patients undergoing surgical treatment of movement disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Functional results of conservative therapy accompanied by interscalane brachial plexus block and patient-controlled analgesia in cases with frozen shoulder,162,"Objectives: We evaluated the efficacy of simultaneous interscalene block and catheter analgesia applied as an aid to conservative treatment in improving shoulder functions in patients with frozen shoulder. Methods: Three patients (2 women, 1 man; mean age 47 years) with frozen shoulder underwent conservative treatment including manipulation under interscalene brachial plexus block and subsequent rehabilitation under catheter analgesia to improve shoulder range of motion and function. Following manipulation under interscalene block, the patients were hospitalized for 15 to 28 days (mean 21 days) for an exercise program performed by a physiotherapist and orthopedist at least twice a day under interscalene catheter analgesia. Thirty minutes before each rehabilitation session, patient-controlled analgesia was administered via a pain relief pump. Active and passive range of motion (ROM) were measured and the severity of pain was rated using a visual analog scale (VAS) prior to and following interscalene block, during the exercise program, and at the end of the treatment. Functional assessments were made before and after treatment using the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale. The exercise program under interscalene analgesia was performed until pain-free and sufficient active movements were obtained, with at least 80% improvement in active and passive motion, a VAS score of 0-2, and an UCLA score of >27. Results: Compared to pretreatment values, the ROM values showed remarkable increases at the end of the treatment. Active ROM reached at least 30° external rotation, 40° internal rotation, 150° flexion, 45o extension, and 100o abduction in all cases. On presentation, the VAS scores of all cases were 10 for both active and passive movements, whereas they ranged from 0 to 2 on discharge. The mean UCLA score increased from 12.3 to 30.3 after treatment. Immediately after the interscalene block, two patients exhibited signs of Horner's syndrome which resolved spontaneously within an hour without the need for treatment. No complications or catheter-related problems such as infection, break-off, or displacement developed throughout the treatment period. There was no requirement for additional analgesia. Conclusion: In patients with frozen shoulder, interscalene block and continuous patient-controlled analgesia via an interscalene catheter provided sufficient analgesia and contributed to the recovery of shoulder functions through an effective and safe exercise program, with no side effects or complications. However, further studies are needed to assess the feasibility of home applications of interscalene patient-controlled analgesia to increase cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction. © 2010 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.",,,,,,,,10.3944/AOTT.2010.2144
Perceptual stability during active and passive head translation: Variations with direction,163,"The world in which we live normally appears perceptually stable as we move around during both active movements and when moving passively, as for example when traveling as a passenger. To achieve such stability, the visual motion experienced has to be compatible with that expected to be associated with the self motion. This in turn requires knowledge about the self motion. During active head movement, information is derived from an efference copy of motor commands as well as vestibular and other proprioceptive sources. Efference copy cues are not available during passive motion. Are there differences between the perception of visual stability under active and passive motion? In previous studies we measured the amount of visual motion needed for the world to appear stable during active head motion and found that ∼1.5 times more visual movement was required than was geometrically necessary. Naso-occipital motion was closer to veridical than other directions (Jaekl et al., 2002, J. Vis. 2(7), 508a). The present study measured the visual motion needed to appear stable during passive motion. Subjects were translated passively at 0.5 Hz while sitting on a cart manually pulled against a powerful spring. Subject motion was naso-occipital, inter-aural or in between. Subjects wore a head-mounted display and were positioned in the centre of a virtual spherical world, radius 1m, which was updated in response to head movement monitored by a mechanical tracker. Subjects varied the ratio between head and image motion until the display appeared perceptually stable. During passive translation, even more visual motion was required to ensure the appearance of moving within an earth stable environment than when motion was active, often needing as much as twice the geometrically required value. Passive naso-occipital motion was again closer to requiring the geometrically correct amount. The experiments help establish the role of efference copy in the perception of self motion.",,,,,,,not the right dependent var,10.1167/3.9.492
The nucleus prepositus predominantly outputs eye movement-related information during passive and active self-motion,164,"Maintaining a constant representation of our heading as we move through the world requires the accurate estimate of spatial orientation. As one turns (or is turned) toward a new heading, signals from the semicircular canals are relayed through the vestibular system to higher-order centers that encode head direction. To date, there is no direct electrophysiological evidence confirming the first relay point of head-motion signals from the vestibular nuclei, but previous anatomical and lesion studies have identified the nucleus prepositus as a likely candidate. Whereas burst-tonic neurons encode only eye-movement signals during headfixed eye motion and passive vestibular stimulation, these neurons have not been studied during self-generated movements. Here, we specifically address whether burst-tonic neurons encode head motion during active behaviors. Single-unit responses were recorded from the nucleus prepositus of rhesus monkeys and compared for head-restrained and active conditions with comparable eye velocities. We found that neurons consistently encoded eye position and velocity across conditions but did not exhibit significant sensitivity to head position or velocity. Additionally, response sensitivities varied as a function of eye velocity, similar to abducens motoneurons and consistent with their role in gaze control and stabilization. Thus our results demonstrate that the primate nucleus prepositus chiefly encodes eye movement even during active head-movement behaviors, a finding inconsistent with the proposal that this nucleus makes a direct contribution to head-direction cell tuning. Given its ascending projections, however, we speculate that this eye-movement information is integrated with other inputs in establishing higher-order spatial representations. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.",,,,,,,,10.1152/jn.00788.2012
"Internal models, vestibular cognition, and mental imagery: Conceptual considerations",165,"Vestibular cognition has recently gained attention. Despite numerous experimental and clinical demonstrations, it is not yet clear what vestibular cognition really is. For future research in vestibular cognition, adopting a computational approach will make it easier to explore the underlying mechanisms. Indeed, most modeling approaches in vestibular science include a top-down or a prioricomponent. We review recent Bayesian optimal observer models, and discuss in detail the conceptual value of prior assumptions, likelihood and posterior estimates for research in vestibular cognition. We then consider forward models in vestibular processing, which are required in order to distinguish between sensory input that is induced by active self-motion, and sensory input that is due to passive self-motion. We suggest that forward models are used not only in the service of estimating sensory states but they can also be drawn upon in an offline mode (e.g., spatial perspective transformations), in which interaction with sensory input is not desired. A computational approach to vestibular cognition will help to discover connections across studies, and it will provide a more coherent framework for investigating vestibular cognition.",,,,,,,,10.1163/22134808-00002503
Cerebellar Prediction of the Dynamic Sensory Consequences of Gravity,166,"As we go about our everyday activities, our brain computes accurate estimates of both our motion relative to the world and our orientation relative to gravity. However, how the brain then accounts for gravity as we actively move and interact with our environment is not yet known. Here, we provide evidence that, although during passive movements, individual cerebellar output neurons encode representations of head motion and orientation relative to gravity, these gravity-driven responses are cancelled when head movement is a consequence of voluntary generated movement. In contrast, the gravity-driven responses of primary otolith and semicircular canal afferents remain intact during both active and passive self-motion, indicating the attenuated responses of central neurons are not inherited from afferent inputs. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that the cerebellum builds a dynamic prediction (e.g., internal model) of the sensory consequences of gravity during active self-motion, which in turn enables the preferential encoding of unexpected motion to ensure postural and perceptual stability.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.cub.2019.07.006
Optokinetic nystagmus is elicited by curvilinear optic flow during high speed curve driving,167,"When analyzing gaze behavior during curve driving, it is commonly accepted that gaze is mostly located in the vicinity of the tangent point, being the point where gaze direction tangents the curve inside edge. This approach neglects the fact that the tangent point is actually motionless only in the limit case when the trajectory precisely follows the curve's geometry. In this study, we measured gaze behavior during curve driving, with the general hypothesis that gaze is not static, when exposed to a global optical flow due to self-motion. In order to study spatio-temporal aspects of gaze during curve driving, we used a driving simulator coupled to a gaze recording system. Ten participants drove seven runs on a track composed of eight curves of various radii (50, 100, 200 and 500. m), with each radius appearing in both right and left directions. Results showed that average gaze position was, as previously described, located in the vicinity of the tangent point. However, analysis also revealed the presence of a systematic optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) around the tangent point position. The OKN slow phase direction does not match the local optic flow direction, while slow phase speed is about half of the local speed. Higher directional gains are observed when averaging the entire optical flow projected on the simulation display, whereas the best speed gain is obtained for a 2° optic flow area, centered on the instantaneous gaze location. The present study confirms that the tangent point is a privileged feature in the dynamic visual scene during curve driving, and underlines a contribution of the global optical flow to gaze behavior during active self-motion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.visres.2011.06.010
Cognitive rehabilitation in bilateral vestibular patients: A computational perspective,168,"There is evidence that vestibular sensory processing affects, and is affected by, higher cognitive processes. This is highly relevant from a clinical perspective, where there is evidence for cognitive impairments in patients with peripheral vestibular deficits. The vestibular system performs complex probabilistic computations, and we claim that understanding these is important for investigating interactions between vestibular processing and cognition. Furthermore, this will aid our understanding of patients' self-motion perception and will provide useful information for clinical interventions. We propose that cognitive training is a promising way to alleviate the debilitating symptoms of patients with complete bilateral vestibular loss (BVP), who often fail to show improvement when relying solely on conventional treatment methods. We present a probabilistic model capable of processing vestibular sensory data during both passive and active self-motion. Crucially, in our model, knowledge from multiple sources, including higher-level cognition, can be used to predict head motion. This is the entry point for cognitive interventions. Despite the loss of sensory input, the processing circuitry in BVP patients is still intact, and they can still perceive self-motion when the movement is self-generated. We provide computer simulations illustrating self-motion perception of BVP patients. Cognitive training may lead to more accurate and confident predictions, which result in decreased weighting of sensory input, and thus improved self-motion perception. Using our model, we show the possible impact of cognitive interventions to help vestibular rehabilitation in patients with BVP.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fneur.2018.00286
Image Blending Techniques and their Application in Underwater Mosaicing,169,"For perceiving 3D information, the human brain uses three important principles: stereo vision, motion parallax and a-priori knowledge about the perspective appearance of objects in dependency of their distance. These tasks pose a challenge to computer vision since decades. Today the most common techniques for 3D sensing are CCD- or CMOS-camera, laser scanner or 3D time-of-flight camera based. Even though evolution has shown predominance for passive stereo vision systems, three additional problems are remaining for 3D perception compared with the two mentioned active vision systems above. First, the computation needs a great deal of performance, since the correlation of two images from a different point of view has to be found. Second, distances to structureless surfaces cannot be measured, if the perspective projection of the object is larger than the camera’s field of view. This problem is often called aperture problem. Finally, a passive visual sensor has to cope with shadowing effects and changes in illumination over time.",,,,,,,,10.1007/978-3-319-05558-9
Planar Pose Estimation Using Object Detection and Reinforcement Learning,170,"Pose estimation concerns systems or models dealing with the determination of a static object’s pose using, in this case, vision. This paper approaching the problem with an active vision-based solution, that integrates both perception and action in the same model. The problem is solved using a combination of neural networks for object detection and a reinforcement learning architecture for moving a camera and estimating the pose. A robotic implementation of the proposed active vision system is used for testing with promising results.

Active vision-based robot localization and navigation in a visual memory,171,"We present a new strategy for active vision-based localization and navigation of a mobile robot in a visual memory, i.e., within a previously-visited area represented as a large collection of images. Vision-based localization in such a large and dynamic visual map is intrinsically ambiguous, since more than one map-locations can exhibit the same visual appearance as the current image observed by the robot. Most existing approaches are passive, i.e., they do not devise any strategy to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we present an active vision-based localization and navigation strategy that can disambiguate the true initial location among possible hypotheses by controlling the mobile observer across a sequence of highly distinctive images, while concurrently navigating towards the target image. The performance of our active localization and navigation algorithm is demonstrated experimentally on a robot moving within a large outdoor environment. © 2011 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980340
Pipeline-architecture based real-time active-vision for human-action recognition,172,"This paper presents a generic framework for on-line reconfiguration of a multi-camera active-vision system for time-varying-geometry object/subject action recognition. The proposed methodology utilizes customizable pipeline architecture to select optimal camera poses in real time. Subject visibility is optimized via a depth-limited search algorithm. All stages are developed with real-time operation as the central focus. A human action-sensing implementation example demonstrates viability. Controlled experiments, first with a human analogue and, subsequently, with a real human, illustrate the workings of the proposed framework. A tangible increase in action-recognition success rate over other strategies, particularly those with static cameras, is noteworthy. The proposed framework is also shown to operate in real-time. Further experiments examine the effect of scaling the number of obstacles and cameras, sensing-system mobility, and library actions on real-time performance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s10846-012-9810-6
Catching the Eye of the Gods: The Gaze in Mesopotamian Literature,173,"""May your benevolent eyes be upon me. Look upon me steadfastly with your radiant features!"" So an Akkadian-language hymn invokes Ishtar, the most powerful goddess in the Mesopotamian pantheon. Descriptions of and appeals for divine gaze appear throughout the Mesopotamian literary corpus, from Sumerian texts of the third millennium BCE through the last known piece of Akkadian literature, the prayer of Antiochus Soter to Nabu, which was written in the third century BCE more than two thousand years later.    This dissertation examines the role of vision in Mesopotamian literature, beginning with a philological study of Sumerian (Chapter 1) and Akkadian (Chapter 2) verbs of vision. Close investigation of the contexts in which these verbs occur and of their grammatical features establishes that the two languages, like English, distinguish between gaze and sight — where sight, on the one hand, denotes inward-moving perception and gaze, on the other, designates outward-moving visual action — and reveals other nuanced differences in meaning between the vocabulary terms.    This philological analysis is followed by an examination of the theoretical underpinnings of vision that uses statistical evidence on the incidence of vision verbs in the literary corpus to uncover Mesopotamian ideas about divine power and the interactions amongst gods and between gods and human beings (Chapter 3). Verbs of gaze and sight fall out dramatically along divine and human lines, with gods being more than three times as likely to gaze as human beings in Sumerian, based on the incidence of igi bar, and twice as likely in Akkadian, based on the incidence of naplusu(m); this unequal distribution of active vision reinforces the power differential between human beings and their deities. Moreover, terminative-infixed igi bar and favourably-modified  naplusu(m) denote gaze that has causative force, the power to affect the external world. This influential gaze is under the almost exclusive purview of the gods and is subject in its use to strict hierarchical restrictions whereby it is always exerted by a higher-status being on a being of lower status and never the reverse.    The dissertation next addresses negatively-connoted vision verbs and visual acts (Chapter 4), revealing that glare, which occurs frequently in the Akkadian literature but comparatively rarely in the Sumerian source materials, is, like beneficent gaze, a chiefly divine capacity that possesses effective force and functions according to rigid hierarchical constraints. The Mesopotamian sources also associate adverse circumstances with the withdrawal of favourable divine gaze, which acts, along with glare, as a second unfavourable counterpart to beneficent gaze. This section on unfavourable vision includes a discussion of the evil eye, with particular attention paid to where it occurs as the subject of a verb of vision.    Finally, the dissertation explores the implications that these and other features of gaze in the literary sources have for our understanding of Mesopotamian religion (Chapter 5). Among other properties, divine gaze is closely associated with kingship and royal legitimacy, both insofar as benefits to a monarch's reign, up to and including a king's very ascension to the throne, figure prominently among the consequences of benevolent divine gaze and insofar as kings share the capacity to gaze in a handful of instances. Parallels between divine gaze and radiance in the literature corroborate the theory, suggested by the subject-differentiated usage of vision verbs, that the Mesopotamians conceived of their gods as essentially active and influential, emanating power outward to affect the world, and of human beings as inherently passive, perceiving rather than performing. This fundamental distinction between the human and the divine pervades Mesopotamian literature, informing and underlying almost every interaction between human beings and their gods.",,,,,,,,
Wearable visual robots,174,"Research work reported in the literature in wearable visual computing has used exclusively static (or non-active) cameras, making the imagery and image measurements dependent on the wearer's posture and motions. It is assumed that the camera is pointing in a good direction to view relevant parts of the scene at best by virtue of being mounted on the wearer's head, or at worst wholly by chance. Even when pointing in roughly the correct direction, any visual processing relying on feature correspondence from a passive camera is made more difficult by the large, uncontrolled inter-image movements which occur when the wearer moves, or even breathes. This paper presents a wearable active visual sensor which is able to achieve a level of decoupling of camera movement from the wearer's posture and motions by a combination of inertial and visual sensor feedback and active control. The issues of sensor placement, robot kinematics and their relation to wearability are discussed. The performance of the prototype robot is evaluated for some essential visual tasks. The paper also discusses potential applications for this kind of wearable robot. © 2002 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s007790200004
A framework for the study of vision in active observers,175,"We present a framework for the study of active vision, i.e., the functioning of the visual system during actively self-generated body movements. In laboratory settings, human vision is usually studied with a static observer looking at static or, at best, dynamic stimuli. In the real world, however, humans constantly move within dynamic environments. The resulting visual inputs are thus an intertwined mixture of self- and externally-generated movements. To fill this gap, we developed a virtual environment integrated with a head-tracking system in which the influence of self- and externally-generated movements can be manipulated independently. As a proof of principle, we studied perceptual stationarity of the visual world during lateral translation or rotation of the head. The movement of the visual stimulus was thus parametrically tethered to self-generated movements. We found that estimates of object stationarity were less biased and more precise during head rotation than translation. In both cases the visual stimulus had to partially follow the head movement to be perceived as immobile. We discuss a range of possibilities for our setup among which the study of shape perception in active and passive conditions, where the same optic flow is replayed to stationary observers. © 2014 SPIE-IS&T.",,,,,,,,10.1117/12.2045459
How speech processing affects our attention to visually similar objects: Shape competitor effects and the visual world paradigm,176,"It was investigated how spoken language is mapped onto the mental representations of objects in the visual field. Specifically, the visual world paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that during 'passive' listening tasks attention is directed more towards objects in the visual field that match the physical shape of the concept of the word concurrently heard than towards objects that do not match on physical shape. Participants listened to sentences containing certain critical target words of concepts with a typical shape (e. g. 'snake') while concurrently viewing a visual display of four objects. We found that participants tended to fixate conceptually unrelated objects with a similar physical shape (e. g. cable) as soon as information from the target word (e. g. 'snake') started to acoustically unfold. The results indicate that (contrary to some priming studies, e. g. Moss et al., 1997) shape information is accessed long before the offset of the spoken word. We discuss the findings with respect to the applicability of the visual world paradigm for the investigation of the access of lexical representations and theories of active vision.",,,,,,,,
Drivers’ response to speed warnings provided by a smart phone app,177,"The distractive effects of mobile phones are well documented, but the recent development of mobile phone apps that provide speed advisory warnings raises the possibility that this technology may be used to improve driver safety in older vehicles. We examined the effects of an intelligent speed advisory (ISA) app on driving performance in a simulator. One hundred and four participants (mean age = 35.52 years; 52 male) were allocated to complete the drive with the ISA app in one of five modes: active audio visual (n = 22), active visual (n = 22), passive audio visual (n = 21), passive visual (n = 21) or control (n = 18). Another 19 participants (mean age = 27.53 years; 8 male) completed the study wearing eye-tracking glasses. Participants drove a simulated 26.4 km section of rural road which incorporated typical hazards and three speed compliance zones (100 km/h, 80 km/h and 60 km/h speed limits). The app led to good compliance with the posted speed limits, particularly during the 60 km/h road segment, where the control group drove at significantly higher speeds than the groups with the ISA app. No significant differences between the four versions of the ISA app were observed, either for speed compliance or the number of speeding alerts received. Across the entire simulated drive there were relatively few glances at the app with an average glance duration of 190 ms. The ISA app did not lead to any negative effects on driving performance; lane keeping was maintained and it did not impede participants’ ability to overtake vehicles. These findings suggest that when properly configured ISA apps have a demonstrable safety benefit and do not produce adverse distractive effects. The greatest challenge may be encouraging drivers’ to use them appropriately and consistently.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.020
Active visual search in non-stationary scenes: Coping with temporal variability and uncertainty,178,"Objective. State-of-the-art experiments for studying neural processes underlying visual cognition often constrain sensory inputs (e.g., static images) and our behavior (e.g., fixed eye-gaze, long eye fixations), isolating or simplifying the interaction of neural processes. Motivated by the non-stationarity of our natural visual environment, we investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of visual recognition while participants overtly performed visual search in non-stationary scenes. We hypothesized that visual effects (such as those typically used in human-computer interfaces) may increase temporal uncertainty (with reference to fixation onset) of cognition-related EEG activity in an active search task and therefore require novel techniques for single-trial detection. Approach. We addressed fixation-related EEG activity in an active search task with respect to stimulus-appearance styles and dynamics. Alongside popping-up stimuli, our experimental study embraces two composite appearance styles based on fading-in, enlarging, and motion effects. Additionally, we explored whether the knowledge obtained in the pop-up experimental setting can be exploited to boost the EEG-based intention-decoding performance when facing transitional changes of visual content. Main results. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the dynamic of visual content can increase temporal uncertainty of the cognition-related EEG activity in active search with respect to fixation onset. This temporal uncertainty challenges the pivotal aim to keep the decoding performance constant irrespective of visual effects. Importantly, the proposed approach for EEG decoding based on knowledge transfer between the different experimental settings gave a promising performance. Significance. Our study demonstrates that the non-stationarity of visual scenes is an important factor in the evolution of cognitive processes, as well as in the dynamic of ocular behavior (i.e., dwell time and fixation duration) in an active search task. In addition, our method to improve single-trial detection performance in this adverse scenario is an important step in making brain-computer interfacing technology available for human-computer interaction applications.",,,,,,,,10.1088/1741-2560/13/1/016015
Visual and haptic perceptual spaces show high similarity in humans,179,"In this study, we show that humans form highly similar perceptual spaces when they explore complex objects from a parametrically defined object space in the visual and haptic domains. For this, a three-dimensional parameter space of welldefined, shell-like objects was generated. Participants either explored two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional, interactive virtual models of these objects visually, or they explored three-dimensional plastic models haptically. In all cases, the task was to rate the similarity between two objects. Using these similarity ratings and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses, the perceptual spaces of the different modalities were then analyzed. Looking at planar configurations within this three-dimensional object space, we found that active visual exploration led to a highly similar perceptual space compared to passive exploration, showing that participants were able to reconstruct the complex parameter space already from twodimensional pictures alone. Furthermore, we found that visual and haptic perceptual spaces had virtually identical topology compared to that of the physical stimulus space. Surprisingly, the haptic modality even slightly exceeded the visual modality in recovering the topology of the complex object space when the whole three-dimensional space was explored. Our findings point to a close connection between visual and haptic object representations and demonstrate the great degree of fidelity with which haptic shape processing occurs. © ARVO.",,,,,,,,10.1167/10.11.2
Effect of subject task on contralateral suppression of click evoked otoacoustic emissions,180,"Contralateral suppression of click evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) is widely used as a non-invasive measure of the activity of the (uncrossed) medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB). There is evidence that the uMOCB receives descending input from the cortex, potentially mediating top-down control during higher order processing. This study investigated whether the contralateral suppression measure is affected by top-down influences during different tasks performed by the participants during recording. Suppression of CEOAEs evoked at 50 and 60 dB SPL was measured under four different task conditions: (1) no task; (2) passive visual (watching a silent subtitled DVD); (3) active visual (responding to visually presented sums); (4) active auditory (detecting tone pips embedded in the evoking click train). The most significant effect of task was found on the recording noise, with both the passive visual and the active auditory task producing significantly lower noise levels than the no task condition. In the passive visual task, this was associated with a reduced inter-subject variability, which enhanced the effect size relative to the no task condition. A main effect of subject task was also found on the change in CEOAE I/O slope due to contralateral noise. This effect reflected a significantly smaller suppression during the active auditory task compared to the no task condition, leading to a reduced effect size. No significant difference in suppression strength between the no task condition and the two non-auditory tasks was observed, suggesting that the main effect of task reflects a specific effect of auditory attention. The data suggest that MOCB activity is inhibited due to top-down influences when selective attention is focussed on the ipsilateral ear. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Head movement co-ordination in the african chameleon,181,"Chameleon head movement was studied to learn how information from more than one sensory system can be co-ordinated to produce a single motor behavior. In this study, the co-ordination of visual, vestibular and kinesthetic senses was examined by: (1) moving a cricket back and forth in front of a hungry chamelon, (2) moving the body of an alert chameleon or the body of an anesthetized chameleon, and (3) moving both a cricket and the body of an alert chameleon. During cricket movement, the chameleon locked both eyes straight forward in their orbits and followed the cricket movement with a visually guided head movement. During movement of the body of an alert chameleon, the vestibulo-collic reflex kept the chameleon's head relatively stationary in space. During movement of the body of an anesthetized chameleon, there was no measurable movement of the head relative to the body. Thus, during the body movements used in this study, passively induced kinesthetic stimulation was negligible. It was hypothesized that during movement of both a cricket and the body of an alert chameleon, the visually guided head movement and the vestibulo-collic reflex were additive. This hypothesis was supported by demonstrating that in this situation, the vestibulo-collic reflex was not suppressed. It is suggested that the vestibulo-collic reflex compensated for the passive head movement produced by body movement without canceling active, visually guided head movement. This may have been accomplished by the use of an efference copy system associated with the motor commands that produce visually guided head movement. © 1988.",,,,,,,,10.1016/0306-4522(88)90346-6
Role of external stimulation in shaping evoked activity in a macroscopic model of cortex,182,"The activity of the brain exhibits stereotypical patterns at various temporal and spatial scales. Novel techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the simultaneous recording of the macroscopic activity from all brain regions while subjects perform various tasks, such as passive hearing and active visual recognition. How neural activity is related to cognitive tasks is a long-standing question for the neuroscience community. This study examines an interesting aspect of this broad question, namely the comparison between the resting state (when the subjects is idle) and evoked activity during a task. Neural activity patterns consist of the correlations of firing activity between cortical regions - or functional connectivity - at a slow time scale (hundreds of ms), which can be related to data obtained from fMRI. The cortex has an intricate architecture of connections, both local and long-range. The latter have been mapped for the whole human cortex using diffusion techniques [1]. A recent model has demonstrated that this broad-scale structural connectivity is crucial to reproduce resting-state patterns of cortical activity [2]. Here we consider the same model and simulate tasks by exciting specific brain regions. We rely on mathematical and numerical analysis in order to uncover the respective roles of the longrange projections and external inputs in shaping the evoked activity. Our primary aim is to understand how the stimulation of specific brain regions can dramatically modify the functional connectivity, as compared to the resting state. We also examine the influence of long-range excitatory projections onto inhibitory populations, a novel dynamical ingredient compared to the previous model, in decorrelating brain regions.",,,,,,,,10.1186/1471-2202-15-s1-p175
An optimization to parallelization of large-scale artificial life animation system based on the Olfactory-Visual Perception model,183,"Compared with traditional computer animation modelingartificial life animation focus on the agent behavior modeling, processing the behavior and motion detail of agents. It brings a great mass of calculation costs, especially the communication and the scale of computing generated by the perception module, making it difficult to achieve parallel in simulation and rendering for the large-scale animation. In this paper, a new Olfactory-Visual Perception Model is proposed for large scenes and parallel structure. Firstly, the model transforms the neighbor search perception to a new perception which common with active visual and passive olfactory perception. Secondly, parallel tasks are divided further through sensors. And at last, a Perception-Reduction approach is designed to achieve parallel computing in this system.

An active acoustic metamaterial with tunable effective density,184,"Extensive efforts are being exerted to develop various types of acoustic metamaterials to effectively control the flow of acoustical energy through these materials. However, all these efforts are focused on passive metamaterials with fixed material properties. In this paper, the emphasis is placed on the development of a class of one-dimensional acoustic metamaterials with tunable effective densities in an attempt to enable the adaptation to varying external environment. More importantly, the active metamaterials can be tailored to have increasing or decreasing variation of the material properties along and across the material volume. With such unique capabilities, physically realizable acoustic cloaks can be achieved and objects treated with these active metamaterials can become acoustically invisible. The theoretical analysis of this class of active acoustic metamaterials is presented and the theoretical predictions are determined for an array of fluid cavities separated by piezoelectric boundaries. These boundaries control the stiffness of the individual cavity and in turn its dynamical density. Various control strategies are considered to achieve different spectral and spatial control of the density of this class of acoustic metamaterials. A natural extension of this work is to include active control capabilities to tailor the bulk modulus distribution of the metamaterial in order to build practical configurations of acoustic cloaks.

Acoustic methods of detection in gas chromatography,185,"A brief review of the use of acoustic detection methods in GC is presented. While a number of methods (some quite similar) have been developed for use as gas-phase sensors in various applications, this article focuses specifically on those techniques that have been used to detect analytes following their separation by GC. Overall, a number of ""active"" acoustic methods (which measure analytes through their interaction with a controlled external acoustic wave source) were reportedly used as GC detectors. These include ultrasonic, thickness shear mode, surface acoustic wave (SAW), and flexural plate wave methods. Conversely, ""passive"" acoustic methods (those that produce an acoustic signal through some chemical reaction with the analyte) have also been used as GC detectors. These include photoacoustic and acoustic flame methods of detection. Of the two major classifications, reports of active methods are far more prevalent. In particular, the usage of SAW techniques with GC is an area of research that has seen accelerated growth in recent years. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

HCI on the Table: Robust Gesture Recognition Using Acoustic Sensing in Your Hand,186,"The paper proposes a new HCI mechanism for device-free gesture recognition on the table using acoustic signal, which can extend the gesture input and interactions beyond the tiny screen of mobile device and allow users to provide input without blocking screen view. Previous researches have either relied on additional devices (e.g., special wearable device and mouse) or required active acoustic signals which demand additional cost and be less prone to popularize, while we explore the device-free gesture recognition using passive acoustic signals. This technology is more challenging due to the lack of an effective approach to eliminate the inherent ambient noise disturbances and extract stable gesture features. We fuse both short time energy (STE) and zero-crossing rate (ZCR) to identify the effective signals from the original input, and leverage the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cochlear filter cepstral coefficients (CFCC) to extract the stable features from different gestures. The unique features in support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieve a high gesture recognition accuracy from the noisy scenarios and mismatched conditions. Implementation on the Android system has realized real-time processing of the feature extraction and gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations show our algorithm has a better noise tolerant performance and the system could recognize seven common gestures (click, flip left/right, scroll up/down, zoom in/out) on smart devices with an accuracy of 93.2%.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973305
Experiment overview and flight results summary from the Vibro Acoustic Launch Protection Experiment (VALPE),187,"The cost of performing any mission on orbit is largely dependent of the cost of getting the mass into orbit. The mass of a spacecraft is driven by the launch loads that the components must be deigned to survive.

Observing the oceans acoustically,190,"Acoustics play a central role in mankind's interactions with the ocean and the life within. Passive listening to ocean ""soundscapes"" informs us about the physical and bio-acoustic environment from earthquakes to communication between fish. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to fisheries and biodiversity related interests. The two together in a multi-purpose network can lead to discovery and improve understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, and marine hazards and maritime safety. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of sound generated and utilized by marine life as well as other natural (wind, rain, ice, seismics) and anthropogenic (shipping, surveys) sources, has dramatically increased worldwide to enhance understanding of ecological processes. Characterizing ocean soundscapes (the levels and frequency of sound over time and space, and the sources contributing to the sound field), temporal trends in ocean sound at different frequencies, distribution and abundance of marine species that vocalize, and distribution and amount of human activities that generate sound in the sea, all require passive acoustic systems. Acoustic receivers are now routinely acquiring data on a global scale, e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System hydroacoustic arrays, various regional integrated ocean observing systems, and some profiling floats. Judiciously-placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed PAM and other systems provide: 1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability, taking advantage of the inherent integrating nature of acoustic travel-time data using tomography; and 2) acoustic positioning (""underwater GPS"") and communication services enabling basin-scale undersea navigation and management of floats, gliders, and AUVs. This will be especially valuable in polar regions with ice cover. Routine deployment of sources during repeat global-scale hydrographic ship surveys would provide high spatial coverage snapshots of ocean temperatures. To fully exploit the PAM systems, precise timing and positioning need to be broadly implemented. Ocean sound is now a mature Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) ""essential ocean variable"", which is one crucial step toward providing a fully integrated global multi-purpose ocean acoustic observing system.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00426
Acoustic detection of biosonar activity of deep diving odontocetes at Josephine Seamount High Seas Marine Protected Area,191,"© 2015 Acoustical Society of America. The temporal occurrence of deep diving cetaceans in the Josephine Seamount High Seas Marine Protected Area (JSHSMPA), south-west Portugal, was monitored using a passive acoustic recorder. The recorder was deployed on 13 May 2010 at a depth of 814m during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation cruise ""Sirena10"" and recovered on 6 June 2010. The recorder was programmed to record 40s of data every 2min. Acoustic data analysis, for the detection and classification of echolocation clicks, was performed using automatic detector/classification systems: M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges), a custom matlab program, and an operator-supervised custom matlab program to assess the classification performance of the detector/classification systems. M3R CS-SVM algorithm contains templates to detect beaked whales, sperm whales, blackfish (pilot and false killer whales), and Risso's dolphins. The detections of each group of odontocetes was monitored as a function of time. Blackfish and Risso's dolphins were detected every day, while beaked whales and sperm whales were detected almost every day. The hourly distribution of detections reveals that blackfish and Risso's dolphins were more active at night, while beaked whales and sperm whales were more active during daylight hours.",,,,,,,,10.1121/1.4919291
Observing the ocean interior in support of integrated management,192,"Active- and passive-acoustic methods are widely used tools for observing, monitoring, and understanding marine ecosystems. From 25 to 28 May 2015, 214 scientists from 31 nations gathered for an ICES symposium on Marine Ecosystem Acoustics (SoME Acoustics) to discuss three major themes related to acoustic observations of marine ecosystems: (i) recent developments in acoustic and platform technologies; (ii) acoustic characterisation of aquatic organisms, ecosystem structure, and ecosystem processes; and (iii) contribution of acoustics to integrated ecosystem assessments and management. The development of, and access to new instruments, such as broad bandwidth systems, enables insightful ecological studies and innovative management approaches. Unresolved ecological questions and the increasing move towards ecosystem based management pose further challenges to scientists and instrument developers. Considering the SoME Acoustics presentations in the context of three previous ICES symposia on fisheries acoustics, topics increasingly emphasize ecosystem studies and management.

Such use of passive tomography is a promising way to reduce acoustic emissions in oceans. A review is first presented, including the description of new concepts of covert active, assisted passive and autonomous tomography, followed by applications on real world data. Under the assumptions of multipath propagation and measurements performed by a sparse network of hydrophones, a time–frequency processor is proposed to simultaneously estimate the source location and the impulse response of the propagation channel for marine mammal calls used as opportunistic sources (multipath structure, time delay and attenuation are estimated). Promising results are obtained on real data coming from the Laurentian channel where wideband beluga calls (1 to 3 kHz) are measured by a sparse network of 6 bottom hydrophones.",,,,,,,,

Passive cavitation imaging using different advanced beamforming methods,195,"The imaging of cavitation is mandatory in order to optimize, quantify and localize accurately ultrasound thrombolysis. The therapy system implemented in the present study uses a novel and dynamic technique to regulate the cavitation activity. To monitor this therapy, passive ultrasound acquisitions are conducted during the sonication, allowing a real-time regulation of cavitation activity. Different advanced passive imaging's methods are investigated here for the reconstruction of cavitation activity maps. More specifically, Time reversal method (TRM) and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) were implemented and discussed. In order to improve the PAM, an additional factor is considered in the beamforming, the phase coherence factor (PCF). To evaluate the importance of each method, two dataset were used: ultrasound cavitation in water bath recorded by a linear ultrasound probe and bubble activity simulation. We conclude by this study that PCF weighted PAM reconstruction algorithm overcome TRM technique for passive cavitation imaging.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728447
"Passive acoustic monitoring of roaring activity in male wapiti cervus elaphusxanthopygus in far east of russia: Effects of recording site, temperature and time of day",196,"Passive acoustic monitoring is an actual tool for population monitoring at conservation and tourist areas. This study provides detailed knowledge of roaring activity of male Far-East wapiti (Cervus elaphus xanthopygus) in the rut period of 2017 at three sites of most active rut at the 453.4 km2 territory of the State Nature Reserve «Bolshekhekhtsirsky» (Far East of Russia). Rutting calls were recorded for 5 min/h throughout the 58-day rut period by using three automated recording devices, one in each site, with simultaneous registration of temperature, once per hour. In total, we recorded 3474 rutting calls (1538, 1159 and 777 calls in the three sites respectively). In each site, the roaring activity (calculated as the mean daily number of calls/h) demonstrated a similar dynamic of three rut phases: Start phase, active phase and fading phase. Although the roaring activity displayed a positive correlation between sites, the actual values of the mean number of calls/h differed between sites. This finding indicates the different use of the three sites by males during the rut. At any site, the roaring activity was related to time of day (hourly); it was the highest between 03:00 a.m. and 06:00 a.m. and nearly lacked between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. At any site, the number of calls/h increased steadily from 8:00 p.m. to 03:00 a.m. to a maximum value and then rapidly decreased from 06:00 to 09:00 a.m. to a minimum value. The effect of temperature on the daily and hourly roaring activity was weaker than the effect of time of day.

Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) habitat in the gulf of Mexico: Satellite observed ocean color and altimetry applied to small-scale variability in distribution,197,"During the summers of 2004 and 2005, researchers surveyed cetacean presence along the continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Towed, passive acoustic hydrophones were used to identify locations along the cruise tracks where sperm whales were encountered and not encountered. During both summers, 35 groups of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were encountered at a frequency of about one group every 120 nmi of survey effort. To assess the linkages between surface oceanography and the distribution of sperm whales, surface ocean color from NASA's Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface dynamic height from NASA's Earth orbital altimeters were evaluated in conjunction with survey data. Most sperm whale groups were found within regions of enhanced sea surface chlorophyll (SSC), particularly 2 wks after the initial development of locally higher SSC anomalies. Results from this study indicate sperm whale distribution in the Gulf of Mexico is linked to surface oceanography at shorter time scales than previously documented.",,,,,,,,10.1578/AM.35.3.2009.358
Plasticity in developing brain: Active auditory exposure impacts prelinguistic acoustic mapping,198,"A major task across infancy is the creation and tuning of the acoustic maps that allow efficient native language processing. This process crucially depends on ongoing neural plasticity and keen sensitivity to environmental cues. Development of sensory mapping has been widely studied in animal models, demonstrating that cortical representations of the sensory environment are continuously modified by experience. One critical period for optimizing human language mapping is early in the first year; however, the neural processes involved and the influence of passive compared with active experience are as yet incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that, while both active and passive acoustic experience from 4 to 7 months of age, using temporally modulated nonspeech stimuli, impacts acoustic mapping, active experience confers a significant advantage. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we show that active experience increases perceptual vigilance/attention to environmental acoustic stimuli (e.g., larger and faster P2 peaks) when compared with passive experience or maturation alone. Faster latencies are also seen for the change discrimination peak (N2*) that has been shown to be a robust infant predictor of later language through age 4 years. Sharpening is evident for both trained and untrained stimuli over and above that seen for maturation alone. Effects were also seen on ERP morphology for the active experience group with development of more complex waveforms more often seen in typically developing 12- to 24-month-old children. The promise of selectively “fine-tuning” acoustic mapping as it emerges has far-reaching implications for the amelioration and/or prevention of developmental language disorders.",,,,,,,"not sure, not clear what they mean by active and passive acoustic experience",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0972-14.2014
Tympanal spontaneous oscillations reveal mechanisms for the control of amplified frequency in tree crickets,199,"Tree cricket hearing shows all the features of an actively amplified auditory system, particularly spontaneous oscillations (SOs) of the tympanal membrane. As expected from an actively amplified auditory system, SO frequency and the peak frequency in evoked responses as observed in sensitivity spectra are correlated. Sensitivity spectra also show compressive non-linearity at this frequency, i.e. a reduction in peak height and sharpness with increasing stimulus amplitude. Both SO and amplified frequency also change with ambient temperature, allowing the auditory system to maintain a filter that is matched to song frequency. In tree crickets, remarkably, song frequency varies with ambient temperature. Interestingly, active amplification has been reported to be switched ON and OFF. The mechanism of this switch is as yet unknown. In order to gain insights into this switch, we recorded and analysed SOs as the auditory system transitioned from the passive (OFF) state to the active (ON) state. We found that while SO amplitude did not follow a fixed pattern, SO frequency changed during the ON-OFF transition. SOs were first detected above noise levels at low frequencies, sometimes well below the known song frequency range (0.5-1 kHz lower). SO frequency was observed to increase over the next ∼30 minutes, in the absence of any ambient temperature change, before settling at a frequency within the range of conspecific song. We examine the frequency shift in SO spectra with temperature and during the ON/OFF transition and discuss the mechanistic implications. To our knowledge, such modulation of active auditory amplification, and its dynamics are unique amongst auditory animals.",,,,,,,,10.1063/1.5038517

Brain dynamics underlying training-induced improvement in suppressing inappropriate action,202,"Inhibitory control, a core component of executive functions, refers to our ability to suppress intended or ongoing cognitive or motor processes. Mostly based on Go/NoGo paradigms, a considerable amount of literature reports that inhibitory control of responses to ""NoGo"" stimuli is mediated by top-down mechanisms manifesting ∼200 ms after stimulus onset within frontoparietal networks. However, whether inhibitory functions in humans can be trained and the supporting neurophysiological mechanisms remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by contrasting auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) to left-lateralized ""Go"" and right NoGo stimuli recorded at the beginning versus the end of 30 min of active auditory spatial Go/NoGo training, as well as during passive listening of the same stimuli before versus after the training session, generating two separate 2 x 2 within-subject designs. Training improved Go/NoGo proficiency. Response times to Go stimuli decreased. During active training, AEPs to NoGo, but not Go, stimuli modulated topographically with training 61-104 ms after stimulus onset, indicative of changes in the underlying brain network. Source estimations revealed that this modulation followed from decreased activity within left parietal cortices, which in turn predicted the extent of behavioral improvement. During passive listening, in contrast, effects were limited to topographic modulations of AEPs in response to Go stimuli over the 31-81 ms interval, mediated by decreased right anterior temporoparietal activity. We discuss our results in terms of the development of an automatic and bottom-up form of inhibitory control with training and a differential effect of Go/NoGo training during active executive control versus passive listening conditions.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE DISCRIMINATION OF MOVING SOUNDS: RHYTHMIC ACTIVITY OF HUMAN BRAIN,203,"The spectral dynamics of the EEG rhythmicity during active and passive discrimination of stationary and moving sound stimuli presented according to the oddball paradigm were investigated. Standard stimuli represented stationary midline sounds. Deviant stimuli simulated smooth and stepwise sound source motion (to the left/right from head midline) produced by linear and stepwise changes of interaural time delay. Significant changes of the brain oscillations were found in the frequency range of 3-30 Hz. The dynamics of the moving deviant stimuli (smooth vs. stepwise) had greater impact on theta-rhythm power in active listening conditions: a stronger theta-power increase was evoked by the stepwise sound motion as compared to smooth motion. Significant increase in theta-power was also observed with rightward sound displacement as compared to leftward displacements. Active deviant discrimination reduced alpha-power (8-11 Hz) mostly during smooth deviant motion. The power increase of lower alpha-oscillations (12-15 Hz) was stronger with step- wise motion than with smooth motion of deviants. The interhemispheric asymmetry of beta-power decrease in active conditions (as compared to passive) was found in the whole beta-range. The sup- pression of beta-power was stronger at the right hemisphere than at the midline or left hemisphere and showed no dependence on spatial properties of the deviant stimuli. This asymmetry may be related to selective attention to task-relevant sounds and with preparation to motor response. Generally, active auditory discrimination resulted in stronger deviant-related changes of the wide-ranged EEG spectral power than passive discrimination with attentional tuning to task-irrelevant stimuli.",,,,,Stimuli are static vs moving but not the listener ,,"not sure, not clear what they mean by active and passive listening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987234
The spatio-temporal dynamics of deviance and target detection in the passive and active auditory oddball paradigm: A sLORETA study,204,"Background: Numerous studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of passive and active deviance and target detection in the well-known auditory oddball paradigm by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present auditory oddball study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of passive versus active deviance and target detection by analyzing amplitude modulations of early and late ERPs while at the same time exploring the neural sources underling this modulation with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Methods: A 64-channel EEG was recorded from twelve healthy right-handed participants while listening to 'standards' and 'deviants' (500 vs. 1000 Hz pure tones) during a passive (block 1) and an active (block 2) listening condition. During passive listening, participants had to simply listen to the tones. During active listening they had to attend and press a key in response to the deviant tones. Results: Passive and active listening elicited an N1 component, a mismatch negativity (MMN) as difference potential (whose amplitudes were temporally overlapping with the N1) and a P3 component. N1/MMN and P3 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced for deviants as compared to standards during both listening conditions. Active listening augmented P3 modulation to deviants significantly compared to passive listening, whereas deviance detection as indexed by N1/MMN modulation was unaffected by the task. During passive listening, sLORETA contrasts (deviants>standards) revealed significant activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the lingual gyri bilaterally (N1/MMN) as well as in the left and right insulae (P3). During active listening, significant activations were found for the N1/MMN in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and for the P3 in multiple cortical regions (e.g., precuneus). Discussion: The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that passive as well as active deviance and target detection elicit cortical activations in spatially distributed brain regions and neural networks including the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and salience network (SN). Based on the temporal activation of the neural sources underlying ERP modulations, a neurophysiological model of passive and active deviance and target detection is proposed which can be tested in future studies.",,,,,,,does attention qualify as active listening?,10.1186/s12868-018-0422-3

Motor-induced suppression of the n100 event-related potential during motor imagery control of a speech synthesizer brain–computer interface,206,"Purpose: Speech motor control relies on neural processes for generating sensory expectations using an efference copy mechanism to maintain accurate productions. The N100 auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been identified as a possible neural marker of the efference copy with a reduced amplitude during active listening while speaking when compared to passive listening. This study investigates N100 suppression while controlling a motor imagery speech synthesizer brain–computer interface (BCI) with instantaneous auditory feedback to determine whether similar mechanisms are used for monitoring BCI-based speech output that may both support BCI learning through existing speech motor networks and be used as a clinical marker for the speech network integrity in individuals without severe speech and physical impairments. Method: The motor-induced N100 suppression is examined based on data from 10 participants who controlled a BCI speech synthesizer using limb motor imagery. We considered listening to auditory target stimuli (without motor imagery) in the BCI study as passive listening and listening to BCI-controlled speech output (with motor imagery) as active listening since audio output depends on imagined movements. The resulting ERP was assessed for statistical significance using a mixed-effects general linear model. Results: Statistically significant N100 ERP amplitude differences were observed between active and passive listening during the BCI task. Post hoc analyses confirm the N100 amplitude was suppressed during active listening. Conclusion: Observation of the N100 suppression suggests motor planning brain networks are active as participants control the BCI synthesizer, which may aid speech BCI mastery.",,,,,,,no behavioral data,10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-MSC18-18-0198
Echolocation system of the bottlenose dolphin,207,"The hypothesis put forward by Vel'min and Dubrovsky [1] is discussed. The hypothesis suggests that bottlenose dolphins possess two functionally separate auditory subsystems: one of them serves for analyzing extraneous sounds, as in nonecholocating terrestrial animals, and the other performs the analysis of echoes caused by the echolocation clicks of the animal itself. The first subsystem is called passive hearing, and the second, active hearing. The results of experimental studies of dolphin's echolocation system are discussed to confirm the proposed hypothesis. For the active hearing of dolphins, the notion of a critical interval is considered as the interval of time within which the formation of a merged auditory image of the echolocation object is formed when all echo highlights of the echo from this object fall within the critical interval. © 2004 MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"".",,,,,,,,10.1134/1.1739499

The 12 x 50 minute Grit sessions are detailed below. The program will delivered by a clinical researcher, with a minimum of provisional registration in psychology and training in clinical psychology, and LLW staff who have been trained in the program. The Grit Wellbeing Program incorporates key elements of strengths‐based mindfulness and Rock and Water psychosocial competency training to increase the social, emotional, psychological, and physical wellbeing of young people and decrease their risk of adverse outcomes. Session 1: The program begins by explaining the mind‐body connection, and how to breathe, ground and centre. Youtube videos are used to demonstrate breathing techniques, and the participants are invited to practice belly breathing. Grounding is then taught using a series of exercises focusing on balancing and anchoring oneself to the ground. Breathing and grounding techniques are then practiced in combination. Finally, participants are taught how to centre themselves by activating their core muscles using simple tensing and stretching exercises. These activities are conducted in a circle, individually, and in pairs. Session 2: This session will be directed towards the final component ‐ focusing, through an extended focus on breathing and on being mindful. The session begins revising the previous session, and revisiting belly breathing in particular. Mindfulness is then introduced using a short video to explain the often rapid activity of our mind. Simple mindful activities are then introduced, to increase participants awareness of how their mind wanders and how to breathe, ground, centre and focus. Focus activities include a mindful check‐in, mindful eating (e.g., popping candy or chocolate), mindful boxing (with boxing gloves and mitts), and/or Chinese boxing (hand exercise). The session concludes with a 10 minute mindful breathing audio track. Session 3. This session focuses on social identity and support, first focusing on the benefits of social support and its importance, identifying types of social groups that we belong to and their importance, followed by a task where clients map out their social world, visibly displaying their social connections, the importance of these connections, and links between their various social groups.

It begins with an exercise to revise teachings on breathing, grounding, centering and focusing, followed by team based exercises ‐ to draw upon and highlight strengths. Participants complete a character strengths survey. Participants learn how to identify their own strengths, while also identifying the strengths of others in their group (using exercises to strength spotting and strength feedback). The session concludes with some breathe, ground, centre, focus exercises (tag, boxing, or shooting hoops ‐ boxing gloves and mitts/basketball required). Session 5: This session focuses on social wellbeing. Beginning with a refocus on breathing, grounding, centring and focusing, and a mindful check‐in. Social games are then integrated with discussions on compatability and loss, as well as barriers to obtaining social support. Ways to give and receive support is then explored, with a re‐emphasis on strengths, and how ones strengths can be used to enhance social connection. Session 6: This session focuses on identity and values. Beginning with a refresh of breath, ground, centre and focus, clients then begin activities mapping out their various roles, interests, and traits; followed by values based activities, mapping out their ideals and values, and steps that can be taken to move towards these ideals. Session 7: This session focuses on communication. Beginning with a practical activity to demonstrate the difference between cooperative versus competitive engagement, the session then moves into an exploration of aggressive, passive and assertive communication styles, with role plays and practical demonstrations, as well as tips for how to communicate more assertively. on social and emotional wellbeing. This session as focuses on boundaries, active listening, and the importance of body language. Session 8. It begins with a strength spotting exercise, followed by a mindful check‐in. The session then focuses how to identify emotions and ways to increase positive emotions using music. The music and mood posters of the key components, are used to facilitate this process. Practical demonstrations will follow of how to identify emotions, and how music can enhance positive emotions (speaker) – and how they can be enhanced by breathing, grounding, centering and focusing when listening to music, and other pleasant events that can be used to en CONDITION: Emotional Wellbeing Social Engagement Substance Use PRIMARY OUTCOME: Level of engagement in education, training or employment (composite score from 2‐items from the Australian Outcome Treatment Profile) Level of substance use and related problems through a composite score (WHO ASSIST) Level of Wellbeing (Mental Health Continuum ‐ Short Form) SECONDARY OUTCOME: 5 Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire: Short Form (FFMQ‐SF).

Introduction to interviewing: The art of communicating with adolescents,210,"Detailed descriptions of a variety of skills, techniques, and tools that facilitate communication with an adolescent in health care settings are the focus of this article. An understanding of developmental tasks of adolescence developmental tasks include pubertal status, autonomy (control, confidentiality, and adherence), identity, and cognitive features (egocentrism, personal fable, and imaginary audience). Common pitfalls in interviewing adolescents are described along with ways to avoid them. Consideration of the nature and setting of the visit also helps to frame the interview. Effective communication with adolescents helps to build a therapeutic alliance and makes interactions more rewarding. Skills that underlie effective communication with adolescents include applying principles of adolescent development; self-awareness; a non-judgmental approach; flexibility with consistency; active listening; and observing. Techniques that enhance an adolescent's information-sharing include engaging patients as therapeutic allies; initiating the interview with nonthreatening topics; assuming nothing; clarifying any inferences made; providing confidentiality and including the patient in the collection of data from other sources; confronting passive-aggressive behavior and substituting assertiveness; asking the patient to keep a daily journal; providing patients with options from which to choose when discussing abstract concepts; linking potentially embarrassing questions with health; using reflective responses; using summarizing statements; and making use of body language.

Activating Audiences: How spatial music can help us to listen,211,"This article discusses the importance of active listening when engaging new audiences with experimental and unfamiliar musical formats. Spatial music is examined as a physically immersive medium in which the audience is implicated as an active component in the execution of its performance. A brief account of the historic context of spatial music will be presented alongside speculation for the trajectory of its future; particularly its potential as a model for audience engagement. This article will first consider how spatially immersive performances have the capacity to activate listeners and how can this help to engage new audiences with new ways of listening. It will also question the notion of inhabiting spatial music, with an investigation of the multiple ways in which spatial music relates to physical space and the terms of its inhabitation. The concept of virtual listening will be discussed in response to trends towards passive hearing, as driven by recent technological developments in acoustic software and hardware, and the resultant abstraction of the spatial and social dynamics of sound in virtual space. The physiological and psychological differences between listening and hearing will also be examined as a means of establishing fundamental differences in the ways that we interact with music, and questioning what our listening habits tell us about audience engagement in the context of experimental music performance. This article will also question the individual roles of the musician, composer, architect/designer and audience in the ongoing responsibility to improve audience engagement in new, or unfamiliar musical works. Importantly, this article will also explicitly examine who we are referring to when we use the term 'new audiences'. Major developments in acoustic technology during the last few decades have somewhat confused the diagram between music, space and listener. The understanding of which elements are active and which are passive is especially ambiguous at a time when ambisonic and binaural technologies have become developed enough to provide accurate simulations of the abstract, acoustic qualities of spaces, but on virtual terms. Architects, composers, musicians, engineers and audiences are at a crossroads in the development of new music and experimental, spatiosonic practice. 'Spatiosonic' is a hybrid term which is used throughout this article to describe work and phenomena which regard space (spatio) and sound (sonic) as equal, interactive partners. This article considers some of the opportunities and limitations at stake in current techniques of composition, performance and listening.",,,,,,,,10.1017/S1355771819000360

Two-field surface pattern control via marginally stable magnetorheological elastomers,213,"The stability and post-bifurcation of a non-linear magnetoelastic film/substrate block is experimentally exploited to obtain active control of surface roughness. The non-intuitive interplay between magnetic field and elastic deformation owes to material and geometry selection, namely a ferromagnetic particle composite film bonded on a compliant passive foundation. Cooperation of the two otherwise independent loading mechanisms-mechanical pre-compression and magnetic field-allows one to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields. We demonstrate for the first time that the critical magnetic field is a decreasing function of pre-compression and vice versa. The experimental results are then probed successfully with full-field finite element simulations at large strains and magnetic fields. The magnetoelastic coupling allows for reversible on/off control of surface wrinkling under adjustable critical magnetic and mechanical fields, thus this study constitutes a first step towards realistic active haptic and morphing devices.",,,,,,,,10.1039/c7sm00996h
Indices of Effortful Listening Can Be Mined from Existing Electroencephalographic Data,214,"Objectives: Studies suggest that theta (∼4 to 7 Hz), alpha (∼8 to 12 Hz), and stimulus-evoked dynamics of the electroencephalogram index effortful listening. Numerous auditory event-related potential datasets exist, without thorough examination of these features. The feasibility of mining those datasets for such features is assessed here. Design: In a standard auditory-oddball paradigm, 12 listeners heard deviant high-frequency tones (10%) interspersed among low-frequency tones (90%) ""near"" or ""far"" separated in frequency. Results: During active listening (deviance detection; experiment 1), sustained frontal midline theta power, and gamma-band inter-trial phase coherence, were greater for the near condition. No significant ""near""/""far"" differences were observable during passive exposure to the same sounds (experiment 2). Conclusions: Increased theta power likely reflects increased utilization of cognitive-control processes (e.g., working memory) that rely on frontal cortical networks. Inter-trial phase coherence differences may reflect differences in attention-modulated stimulus encoding. Reanalysis of existing datasets can usefully inform future work on listening effort.",,,,,,,not behavioral,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000354
Tactile Perception for Stroke Induce Changes in Electroencephalography,215,"Objective/Background Tactile perception is a basic way to obtain and evaluate information about an object. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of tactile perception on brain activation using two different tactile explorations, passive and active touches, in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Methods Twenty patients who were diagnosed with stroke (8 right brain damaged, 12 left brain damaged) participated in this study. The tactile perception was conducted using passive and active explorations in a sitting position. To determine the neurological changes in the brain, this study measured the brain waves of the participants using electroencephalography (EEG). Results The relative power of the sensory motor rhythm on the right prefrontal lobe and right parietal lobe was significantly greater during the active tactile exploration compared to the relative power during the passive exploration in the left damaged hemisphere. Most of the measured brain areas showed nonsignificantly higher relative power of the sensory motor rhythm during the active tactile exploration, regardless of which hemisphere was damaged. Conclusion The results of this study provided a neurophysiological evidence on tactile perception in individuals with chronic stroke. Occupational therapists should consider an active tactile exploration as a useful modality on occupational performance in rehabilitation training.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.hkjot.2016.10.001
Static and active tactile perception and touch anisotropy: aging and gender effect,46,"Although the human finger is the interface used for the touch process, very few studies have used its properties to provide a description of tactile perception regarding age and gender effects. Age and gender effects on the biophysical properties of the human finger were the main topics of our previous study. Correlating tactile perception with each parameter proved very complex. We expand on that work to assess the static and dynamic touch in addition to the touch gestures. We also investigate the age and gender effects on tactile perception by studying the finger size and the real contact area (static and dynamic) of forty human fingers of different ages and gender. The size of the finger and the real contact area (static and dynamic) define the density of the mechanoreceptors. This density is an image of the number of mechanoreceptors solicited and therefore of tactile perception (static and dynamic). In addition, the touch gestures used to perceive an object’s properties differ among people. Therefore, we seek to comprehend the tactile perception of different touch gestures due to the anisotropy of mechanical properties, and we study two different directions (top to bottom and left to right).",32.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/79af86a83e334def3f72548e31a27b9f/f32826b8/32.pdf),,,,"Not sure about comparisons: I need to read the method

Occlusal force and oral tactile sensibility measured in partially edentulous patients with ITI implants,216,"Maximal occlusal force and oral tactile sensibility were recorded in (1) a group of partially edentulous patients restored with ITI implants supporting fixed prostheses or single crowns and (2) a control group consisting of fully dentate subjects with healthy natural teeth. Maximal occlusal force was measured with a miniature force transducer placed between antagonistic implant/tooth pairs in the test group and antagonistic teeth in the control group. The detection threshold of minimal pressure (ie, passive tactile sensibility) was recorded with dynamometers, and minimal perceived thickness (active tactile sensibility) was assessed using steel foils with a thickness from 100 to 10 microns. Highest maximal occlusal force was measured in fully dentate subjects on second premolars (average 450 N). A significant reduction on the first premolars (300 N) was observed. With fixed prostheses supported by implants, the average value of maximal occlusal force was distinctly lower, about 200 N for first premolars and for molars, and 300 N for second molars. The maximum force was again found on second premolars. The detection threshold of minimal pressure was significantly higher on implants than on natural teeth. The average number of wrong assessments when testing steel foils was 3.2 for antagonistic implant/tooth pairs and 2.6 for natural teeth. The comparison of test sides (with implants) and control sides (without implants) in patients of the test group did not reveal significant differences of measurements. It seems that patterns of oral function depend primarily on the state of dentition, type of prosthodontic restorations, and on psychological aspects, and secondarily on the presence of implants.",,,,,,,,10.1097/00008505-199600510-00032
The influence of motor task on tactile suppression during action,47,"Movement of a limb substantially decreases the intensity and sensitivity with which tactile stimuli on that limb are perceived. This movement-related tactile suppression likely interferes with performance in motor tasks that require the precise evaluation of tactile feedback, such as the adjustment of grip forces during grasping. Therefore, we hypothesise that suppression might be stronger for stimuli that are irrelevant to successful performance in a given motor task. To test this hypothesis, we measured participants’ perception of tactile intensity while performing different motor tasks. We investigated perception of both suprathreshold stimuli (Exp. 1: intensity discrimination) and of stimuli close to the detection threshold (Exp. 2: detection). We compared tactile perception between two grasping conditions (active, tactile inputs relevant), a condition where participants pointed in the air (active, tactile inputs irrelevant) and a static condition (baseline). In both experiments, we observed tactile suppression in all three movement conditions but not the predicted attenuation of tactile suppression in the grasp conditions. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was even an amplification of tactile suppression in the grasping conditions of Exp. 1, which might be related to the movement velocity. In conclusion, we did not find evidence that motor tasks modulate the strength of tactile suppression. Our results further suggest that it is important to control for possibly confounding variables, such as movement velocity and laterality, in this line of research.",,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42321-0_15
Discharge properties of neurones in the hand area of primary somatosensory cortex in monkeys in relation to the performance of an active tactile discrimination task - I. Areas 3b and 1,217,"The present experiments were designed to characterize the discharge patterns of single cortical neurones within the cutaneous representation of the hand in postcentral cortex (areas 3b and 1) in awake monkeys during the performance of an active tactile discrimination task. The task consisted of making a single scanning movement over a surface (first half smooth; second half smooth or rough); the texture encountered over the second half of the surface was indicated by the animal, respectively, pushing or pulling a lever. Unitary discharge was recorded from 118 cells receiving input from the hand or distal forearm of two monkeys. Units with cutaneous fields on the digit tips in contact with the surfaces to be discriminated showed an increase in discharge (58%), a decrease in discharge (11%) or no change (31%) during the task. Units with cutaneous fields not in contact with the discriminanda were much more likely to show decreased discharge during the task (25%), suggesting that there is some selection of cutaneous inputs in this task. Cutaneous units in areas 3b and 1 were equally likely to signal differences in texture (respectively, 18% and 26% of those with digital receptive fields (RFs)) and most of the texture-related units (78%) had a large RF, spanning several digits. The discharge patterns of single texture-related cells did not reliably signal whether or not the animal successfully discriminated the surfaces: unitary responses were occasionally absent even though the animal correctly identified the surface or they were present when an incorrect response was made. This observation suggested that information derived from a population of cells is required for the performance of the task, since no single cell's discharge contained sufficient information upon which the animal could base its behavioural response. A group of cells with digital RFs (24% of area 3b cells and 15 % of area 1 units) were classified as movement-related. Their discharge signalled precisely the onset and/or end of movement, and they were generally insensitive to the texture of the surfaces scanned. Such cells may serve as an independent source of information for primary somatosensory cortex related to the physical parameters of movement. Most cells with digital RFs were more responsive during active tactile discrimination than during passive movement of the digits over the surfaces (monkey no longer required to discriminate the surface texture). For area 3b units, peripheral factors (RF orientation, speed of movement) were likely responsible for this observation. For area 1 units, the situation was more complex: 26% of the area 1 units were only active during the active behavioural task, suggesting that such units may signal peripheral events, but in a context-dependent manner. This may be related to attention, although other factors were not ruled out in the present experiments. Finally, the depth of modulation in the task was almost always less than that produced by classical RF testing, suggesting that the tactile inputs generated during exploratory movements are subject to gating controls, as has been shown for other types of movements. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,Behavioral data?,,,10.1007/BF00231849
Discharge properties of neurones in the hand area of primary somatosensory cortex in monkeys in relation to the performance of an active tactile discrimination task - II. Area 2 as compared to areas 3b and 1,218,"The discharge patterns of 144 single cortical neurones, within the cutaneous representation of the hand in area 2 (primary somatosensory cortex, SI), were studied in two rhesus monkeys during the performance of an active tactile discrimination task. These were compared to those previously described for units within areas 3b and 1 recorded from the same animals. The task consisted of making a single scanning movement of the digit tips over a surface (first half smooth; second half either smooth or rough). The nature of the texture encountered over the second half of the surface was indicated by the monkey making a differential lever response (push or pull) with the opposite hand. During the task, area 2 units with cutaneous receptive fields (RFs) on the digit tips of interest (those scanned over the surfaces) generally showed an increase in their discharge (75%); patterns of decreased discharge or no modulation (respectively, 12 and 13%) were rarely observed. Units with digital cutaneous RFs not in contact with the stimuli were much more likely to show either a pattern of decreased discharge or no modulation whatsoever (47% in each case), suggesting that there is some selection of cutaneous inputs in this task in that non-active inputs are selectively gated. For units with a cutaneous RF, the sign of modulation changed significantly across SI, in a manner consistent with a pattern of increased convergence onto the more caudal regions of SI. Overall, the proportions of area 2 units with digital RFs on the tips of interest that were classified as either texturerelated (25%) or movement-related (26%) were similar to those reported previously for areas 3b and 1, suggesting that their presumed roles in, respectively, the analysis of surface texture and the representation of the physical parameters of movement are shared and distributed across the three cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of SI under consideration. In addition, the discharge patterns of single texture-related cells in areas 3b, 1 and 2 did not reliably signal whether or not the animal successfully discriminated the surfaces, suggesting that information from a population of cells is required for the performance of the task. Texture-related responses in area 2 were, however, unique in two ways. Firstly, 35% of the texture-related units had additional discharges related to the performance of the scanning movement (texture- and movement-related cells); no such units were found in area 3b, and only one was encountered in area 1. Secondly, the texture-related responses of a subgroup of area 2 units (25%) varied as a function of the order of presentation of the surfaces. As response time also varied with the order of presentation, it is suggested that such cells might represent an intermediate step in the transformation of the sensory input to a behavioural response. Although most units with digital RFs were more responsive during active tactile discrimination than during passive movements of the digits over the same surfaces, secondary factors (speed of movement) were often responsible for this observation. In this aspect, area 2 discharge properties seemed closer to those previously described for area 3b than to those described for area 1. In contrast to both areas 3b and 1, however, the extent of modulation in the task of one-third of the units with larger multi-digit RFs was similar to that produced by classical RF testing, instead of being less (as found for areas 3b and 1). The latter observation suggests that some tactile inputs from the digit tips of interest are transmitted to area 2 relatively unchanged during exploratory movements, and that gating controls in this task of active tactile discrimination may be directed more towards cutaneous inputs to areas 3b and 1 than to area 2. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,Behavioral data?,,,10.1007/BF00231655
A comparison of the P300 and PET in patients with disorders of consciousness in absence of response to command,219,"Background and aims: Diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) has become more accurate by using standardized behavioral assessment and objective measures of consciousness derived from neuroimaging. Another major challenge is the assessment of covert response to command in patients who do not present overt response to command, in order to ultimately find a means of communication. Methods: We assess the passive (auditory and tactile) and active (tactile) P300 ERP in twelve patients without behavioral command following to test its sensitivity for the detection of residual consciousness and confront it to cerebral metabolism as measured with glucose PET, the most sensitive objective diagnostic tool. Results: For the passive paradigms we have found that the accuracy of the discrimination of the standard and deviant stimuli in the auditory paradigm is higher for UWS than for MCS patients, while for the tactile paradigm the accuracy is slightly higher for MCS than UWS patients. There was no correlation between percentage of glucose metabolism reduction and P300 accuracy. One patient reached a high accuracy during the active tactile paradigm, suggestive of covert command following, even if behavioral command following was absent, and no discernable difference between the PET of this and other patients could be observed. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the passive P300 is not a good marker for consciousness or overall brain metabolism. On the other hand, the active P300 might probe covert command following in patients without behavioral response to command and therefore could be a valuable addition in the clinical assessment of DOC patients.",,,,,,,,
Influence of active encoding on tactile recognition memory for common objects,220,"Active tactile recognition memory for common objects is compared with passive touch.

Object manipulation had a significant effect and the group means were all significantly different (p≥.05), with the largest performance decrement due to passive touch at encoding.

Discrimination Thresholds for Passive Tactile Volume Perception by Fingertips,49,"Haptic object perception is still poorly understood up to now. This study investigated the ability of human fingers to discriminate the volume of objects by passive touch. Experiments measured the discrimination threshold of volume using three tasks: passive tactile volume perception, passive tactile area perception, and active tactile volume perception. In each trial, we utilized two plastic cubes to successively stimulate the fingers, and participants were instructed to make comparisons between the stimulus objects’ volume and area. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the discrimination thresholds of tactile volume perception between passive touch and active touch, whereas significant differences in the discrimination thresholds between fingertips, such as the thumb versus the pinky finger. In passive touch, the discrimination thresholds of volume perception were larger than that with surface area perception. We found that the discrimination of the volume of objects is more difficult than the discrimination of the area of the objects.",,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0301006619878560
Haptic information processing in direct and indirect memory tests,221,"Effects of learning can show up in a direct, i. e., an explicit, way or they can be expressed indirectly, i. e., in an implicit way. It was investigated whether motor processes underlie effects of repetition priming in haptic information exploration. In the test phase, blindfolded subjects had to handle objects in order to answer questions as fast as possible about their properties (e.g., temperature, texture, weight, or form), exploring the object with their hands. Some of the objects were old ones (presented in a study phase); others were added as new objects to the test phase. In addition, recognition judgements were required. The results demonstrated reliable effects of repetition priming in terms of reaction times to old, in comparison with new, objects for subjects who had been treated the same way in the study phase (active touch). Passive touch at encoding or studying the names or the visible objects themselves did not lead to effects of repetition priming in the test phase. On the other hand, performing adequate hand movements during the study improved recognition memory. The role of motor processes in indirect and direct tests of memory is discussed and related to research on memory of action events. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF01371824
Tactual shape perception in relation to the understanding of geometrical concepts by blind students,222,"Tactual shape perception is a synthesis of many parameters which lead blind students to make sense of external stimuli. It is vital to investigate this field of perception because it reveals many differences between passive and active touch. The van Hiele model provides a tool for investigating and classifying students’ thinking in geometry. In a study of 19 blind and visually impaired students in a special school in Greece, we sought to understand their own way of approaching, developing and understanding concepts of shape. The findings support on one hand the appropriateness of the van Hiele theory and on the other the complexity of tactual shape perception and its uniqueness with respect to every student's thinking. Teachers and specialists can enrich their understanding and be more effective when teaching geometrical concepts that require taking into account variables such as: touch, movement, posture, type of shape, language, prior knowledge and the conditions of the task. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Object exploration using vision and active touch,223,"Achieving object exploration with passive vision and active touch has been under investigation for thirty years. We build upon recent progress in biomimetic active touch that combines perception via Bayesian evidence accumulation with controlling the tactile sensor using perceived stimulus location. Here, passive vision is combined with active touch by providing a visual prior for each perceptual decision, with the precision of this prior setting the relative contribution of each modality. The performance is examined on an edge following task using a tactile fingertip (the TacTip) mounted on a robot arm. We find that the quality of exploration is a U-shaped function of the relative contribution of vision and touch; moreover, multi-modal performance is more robust, completing the contour when touch alone fails. The overall system has several parallels with biological theories of perception, and thus plausibly represents a robot model of visuo-tactile exploration in humans.",,,,,,,,10.1109/IROS.2017.8206542
Effects of long-term sensory deprivation on asymmetric synapses in the whisker barrel field of the adult rat,224,"Whisker trimming deprives the cortical barrel field from the patterned sensory input that derives from active touch but leaves passive tactile signals unaltered. We have studied in the rat barrel field, by stereological procedures, the effects of a sustained period of unilateral deprivation by whisker clipping during adolescence and early adulthood on (1) the surface density (SV) of asymmetric synapses, as determined from measuring the presynaptic membrane specializations, and (2) the numerical density of asymmetric synaptic profiles (NA), classified according to their postsynaptic target and their apparent curvature. Compared to control rats, the procedure did not change the overall volume of the region, the volume fraction occupied by each cortical layer, or the volume fraction occupied by unmyelinated axons and boutons. However, the deprived barrel cortex displayed an increase in SV in layers I and II, and an increase in NA in layer I and in the cortex as a whole, mainly due to an increase in profiles with a convex shape. Layer IV was the least affected by the deprivation. These results point to a net increase, rather than a decrease, of excitatory synapses in the deprived cortex, which could result from a deprivation-induced decrease in the rate of normal synapse loss. This effect occurs specifically in superficial layers, more involved in intracortical and cortico-cortical, rather than thalamo-cortical, processing. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An fMRI study on cortical responses during active self-touch and passive touch from others,225,"Active, self-touch and the passive touch from an external source engage comparable afferent mechanoreceptors on the touched skin site. However, touch directed to glabrous skin compared to hairy skin will activate different types of afferent mechanoreceptors. Despite perceptual similarities between touch to different body sites, it is likely that the touch information is processed differently. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the cortical differences in the neural signal of touch representations during active, self-touch and passive touch from another, to both glabrous (palm) and hairy (arm) skin, where a soft brush was used as the stimulus.There were two active touch conditions, where the participant used the brush in their right hand to stroke either their left palm or arm. There were two similar passive, touch conditions where the experimenter used an identical brush to stroke the same palm and arm areas on the participant. Touch on the left palm elicited a large, significant, positive blood-oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal in right sensorimotor areas. Less extensive activity was found for touch to the arm. Separate somatotopical palm and arm representations were found in Brodmann area 3 of the right primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and in both these areas, active stroking gave significantly higher signals than passive stroking. Active, self-touch elicited a positive BOLD signal in a network of sensorimotor cortical areas in the left hemisphere, compared to the resting baseline. In contrast, during passive touch, a significant negative BOLD signal was found in the left SI. Thus, each of the four conditions had a unique cortical signature despite similarities in afferent signalling or evoked perception. It is hypothesized that attentional mechanisms play a role in the modulation of the touch signal in the right SI, accounting for the differences found between active and passive touch.",,,,,I want to check if they show behavioral data,,,
Le toucher chez les enfants prématurés,226,"Touch being the first sense to develop in utero, it plays an essential role in the perceptual-cognitive development in infancy. The study of tactile skills in premature infants is a relevant approach to better understand the early development of touch.

Overall, studies show in premature infants the occurrence of 1. discrimination subsequent to passive tactile stimulation from 30 weeks of gestation; 2. active manual discrimination between two different object shapes from 28 weeks and finally 3. beneficial effects on their neurodevelopmental future after receiving a massage therapy or the kangaroo mother care.",,,,,,,,10.4074/S0013754513001055
Occupation-related long-term sensory training enhances roughness discrimination but not tactile acuity,227,"Extensive use of sensorimotor properties has been shown to lead to use-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex as well as sensory areas. The sensory consequences of these cortical changes, however, remain widely unclear. We were interested whether job-related long-term haptic training is measurable in terms of changes in haptic perception (active touch exploration) in manual physiotherapists (PT). To that end, the haptic thresholds of PT (students and employed) and registered osteopathic manual therapists (OMT; PT with postgraduate specialization) were measured and compared to age- and sex-matched control groups. Additionally, tactile acuity (passive static touch) was assessed using grating domes. PT and OMT had superior mean haptic thresholds compared to the control group, suggesting an increase in sensitivity through use. An age-related decline in haptic perception capacity occurred only in the control group, suggesting that the job-related training of the manual therapist groups may have slowed their age-related decline. Contrary to our expectation, we found significantly poorer mean haptic threshold results in the PT student group than for the controls. No significant differences or changes in tactile acuity were found for any of the groups (students and professional). The present results demonstrate use-dependent plasticity in manual therapists. Furthermore, the results underline the known effect of a superior discrimination ability of haptic as opposed to tactile perception. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s00221-014-3882-4

Neurons in the human basolateral amygdala and hippocampal formation do not respond to odors,231,"Extracellular action potentials were recorded from human hippocampal, hippocampal gyrus, and basolateral amygdala neurons during passive and active olfactory stimulation. Introduction of an odor into a continuous stream of air passing over the olfactory mucosa resulted in no detectable change in firing. Actively sniffing from an odorous flask, whether or not the odor was detected or recognized, also failed to elicit an immediate unit response. However, after a latency of 10-15 sec, the slight hyperventilation inherent in sniffing did induce a strong change in firing by many neurons. In contrast to these unit responses, a short-latency EEG spindle was recorded in the amygdala that appeared directly related to mechanical stimulation of the olfactory mucosa. © 1977.",,,,,,,,10.1016/0304-3940(77)90179-3
Age and Gender Related Normal Motion of the Cervical Spine,232,"The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical method for measuring throe-dimensional motion of the cervical spine usrnp the CA &DOD Spine Motion Analyzer (Orthopaedic Systems inc., Hayward CA.), Normal values for passive examinaons of flexion-extesnsion, lateral bending, rotation, rotation out of maximum fission, and notation put of maximum extension were obtained and analyzed for each gender in B group of 150 normal subjects. Gender classifications were further subdivided into age groups, with tsach dEcade containing asymptomatic volunteers. Values for each group were compared for differences wilh respect to ago and gandur differences. A detailed error analysis was also performed on the Interobserver and intraobserver repeatability, differences between pessive and active tasting, and the use of different fixation devices. Significantly decreased motion differences were found between age groups within gender, and between gender groups in corresponding dacados. Results of rotation out of maximum flexion suggest and support earlier cunclusiotis that the rotetion of the C1-C2 segment does not decrease with age, but rather increases slightly to perhaps compensate for the overall decreased motion in tine lower segments. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.",,,,,,,,10.1097/00007632-199210001-00009
Evaluation of a conceptual framework for predicting navigation performance in virtual reality,233,"Previous research in spatial cognition has often relied on simple spatial tasks in static environments in order to draw inferences regarding navigation performance. These tasks are typically divided into categories (e.g., egocentric or allocentric) that reflect different two-systems theories. Unfortunately, this two-systems approach has been insufficient for reliably predicting navigation performance in virtual reality (VR). In the present experiment, participants were asked to learn and navigate towards goal locations in a virtual city and then perform eight simple spatial tasks in a separate environment. These eight tasks were organised along four orthogonal dimensions (static/dynamic, perceived/remembered, egocentric/allocentric, and distance/direction). We employed confirmatory and exploratory analyses in order to assess the relationship between navigation performance and performances on these simple tasks. We provide evidence that a dynamic task (i.e., intercepting a moving object) is capable of predicting navigation performance in a familiar virtual environment better than several categories of static tasks. These results have important implications for studies on navigation in VR that tend to over-emphasise the role of spatial memory. Given that our dynamic tasks required efficient interaction with the human interface device (HID), they were more closely aligned with the perceptuomotor processes associated with locomotion than wayfinding. In the future, researchers should consider training participants on HIDs using a dynamic task prior to conducting a navigation experiment. Performances on dynamic tasks should also be assessed in order to avoid confounding skill with an HID and spatial knowledge acquisition.",,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0184682
Dynamic perception after visually guided grasping by a human-like autonomous robot,234,"We will explore dynamic perception following the visually guided grasping of several objects by a human-like autonomous robot. This competency serves for object categorization. Physical interaction with the hand-held object gives the neural network of the robot the rich, coherent and multi-modal sensory input. Multi-layered self-organizing maps are designed and examined in static and dynamic conditions. The results of the tests in the former condition show its capability of robust categorization against noise. The network also shows better performance than a single-layered map does. In the latter condition we focus on shaking behavior by moving only the forearm of the robot. In some combinations of grasping style and shaking radius the network is capable of categorizing two objects robustly. The results show that the network capability to achieve the task largely depends on how to grasp and how to move the objects. These results together with a preliminary simulation are promising toward the self-organization of a high degree of autonomous dynamic object categorization. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,10.1163/156855306775525785
Fractionation of visuoperceptual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease,235,"There is considerable evidence that visuoperceptual function is impaired in Parkinson's disease although this view remains contentious. The issue is confounded by studies which have demonstrated impairment of visual sensation, in particular high-contrast visual acuity, in Parkinson's disease. We have measured the visuoperceptual performance of 16 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease, both on and off drugs, and 16 age and sex matched control subjects on non-motor tests of visual resolution, static perception, and dynamic perception. Performance on the perceptual tasks was measured in terms of perceptual resolutions and was found impaired in the parkinsonian group. After removal of the contribution of poorer visual resolution, the overall visual perception remained impaired, although to a relatively subtle degree, such that the difference between the two groups on its static and dynamic components did not reach significance. © 1995.",,,,,,,,10.1016/0022-510X(95)00043-2
Learning Preference Models for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Complex Domains,236,"Achieving robust and reliable autonomous operation even in complex unstruc-tured environments is a central goal of field robotics. As the environments and scenarios to which robots are applied have continued to grow in complexity, so has the challenge of properly defining preferences and tradeoffs between various actions and the terrains they result in traversing. These definitions and parameters encode the desired behavior of the robot; therefore their correctness is of the utmost importance. Current manual approaches to creating and adjusting these preference models and cost functions have proven to be incredibly tedious and time-consuming, while typically not producing optimal results except in the simplest of circumstances. This thesis presents the development and application of machine learning techniques that automate the construction and tuning of preference models within complex mobile robotic systems. Utilizing the framework of inverse optimal control, expert examples of robot behavior can be used to construct models that generalize demonstrated preferences and reproduce similar behavior. Novel learning from demonstration approaches are developed that offer the possibility of significantly reducing the amount of human interaction necessary to tune a system, while also improving its final performance. Techniques to account for the inevitability of noisy and imperfect demonstration are presented, along with additional methods for improving the efficiency of expert demonstration and feedback. The effectiveness of these approaches is confirmed through application to several real world domains, such as the interpretation of static and dynamic perceptual data in unstructured environments and the learning of human driving styles and maneuver preferences. Extensive testing and experimentation both in simulation and in the field with multiple mobile robotic systems provides empirical confirmation of superior autonomous performance, with less expert interaction and no hand tuning. These experiments validate the potential applicability of the developed algorithms to a large variety of future mobile robotic systems.",,,,,,,,
Visuoperceptual and visuomotor deficits in developmental stutterers: An exploratory study,237,"Although the cause of stuttering is unknown, there is strong evidence for it being a neuromotor disorder characterised by an abnormality of higher control encompassing not only speech but other motor systems. The aim of this exploratory study was to look for the presence of non-speech/language deficits - in particular, visuomotor and visuoperceptual deficits - in persons who stutter. Twelve moderate to severe developmental stutterers were compared with a group of fluent speakers, matched for age and sex, on a range of computerized sensory-motor tasks. These tasks covered various aspects of visuomotor function - ballistic movement, dynamic steadiness, and several types of tracking - and visuoperceptual function - acuity, static perception, and dynamic perception. A novel technique was used to remove the visuospatial component from tracking performance. Stutterers had slower reaction times, less accurate random tracking, and impaired dynamic visual perception. Severity of stuttering correlated with reaction time and dynamic perception. Removal of the visuoperceptual component from tracking performance indicated that the impaired tracking in the stutterers was predominantly due to reduced dynamic perception.This is the first study to provide preliminary evidence for the presence of non-linguistic visuoperceptual and upper-limb visuomotor tracking deficits in people with moderate to severe stuttering. These findings support a neurogenic aetiology for stuttering and are compatible with evidence of an overactive dopamine system in stutterers. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Secondary action in robot motion,238,"Secondary action, a concept borrowed from character animation, improves the animation realism by augmenting natural, passive motion to primary action. We use dynamic simulation to induce three techniques of secondary motion for robot hardware, which exploit actuation passivity to overcome hardware constraints and change the dynamic perception of the robot and its motion characteristics. Results of secondary motion due to internal and external forces are presented including discussion on how to choose the appropriate technique for a particular application. © 2010 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598730
Computing spatiotemporal relations for dynamic perceptual organization,239,"To date, the overwhelming use of motion in computational vision has been to recover the three-dimensional structure of the scene. We propose that there are other, more powerful, uses for motion. Toward this end, we define dynamic perceptual organization as an extension of the traditional (static) perceptual organization approach. Just as static perceptual organization groups coherent features in an image, dynamic perceptual organization groups coherent motions through an image sequence. Using dynamic perceptual organization, we propose a new paradigm for motion understanding and show why it can be done independently of the recovery of scene structure and scene motion. The paradigm starts with a spatiotemporal cube of image data and organizes the paths of points so that interactions between the paths, and perceptual motions such as common, relative, and cyclic are made explicit. The results of this can then be used for high-level motion recognition tasks. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,,,,,,,10.1006/cviu.1993.1048
Population Size and Suicide in U.S. Cities: A Static and Dynamic Exploration,240,"The relationship between city population size and suicide rates rarely has been examined directly, though scholars often assume such a relationship exists based on studies of the association between suicide rates and urbanization (percent of the population living in cities) in various social contexts. In an effort to determine the basic association between suicide rates and city population size, we analyze data for four time points, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990, using a random sample of U.S. cities with 10,000 or more population in 1960. In addition, we conduct a time series analysis of change in population size and change in suicide rates over a two decade period. Results indicate that an association between population and suicide is atypical, and even when observed is highly sensitive to methodological specifications. The results call into question the notion that larger city population size is conducive to suicide as well as the assumption that studies of suicide and urbanization can substitute for studies of suicide and city population size.",,,,,,,,10.1521/suli.2007.37.5.553
Management of Common Coccygodynia,241,"Introduction Common coccygodynia is poorly understood. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed as to the origin of the syndrome, including pain from the pericoccygeal soft tissues, spasm of the muscles of the pelvic floor, referred pain from lumbar pathology, arachnoiditis of the lower sacral nerve roots, local posttraumatic lesions, somatization, etc (Howorth 1959, Jurmand 1976, Nelson 1991, Postacchini & Massobrio 1983, Stern 1967). Thus far, there has been no sound confirmation of any of these.  Because patients often mention a fall on the buttocks or a delivery as precipitating event, a mechanical basis for the pain is likely. In addition, in the majority of cases, the pain occurs only in the sitting position. These factors led us to develop a protocol to document the painful coccyx with dynamic films and coccygeal discography (Maigne et al 1992, 1994). Dynamic films are defined as X-rays films in the lateral sitting position (the painful position) as compared with standard lateral roentgenograms. Since 1992, more than 700 patients with coccygeal pain have undergone this protocol. We summarize here the results of our studies on this topic.  Anatomical study of the sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal discs There is a paucity of information regarding this topic. According to Gray (1973) the sacrococcygeal joints are thin intervertebral discs of fibrocartilage. Occasionally, the intercoccygeal joints are synovial.  By examining nine aged coccyges from fresh cadavers, we found that the sacrococcygeal joint was a disc in one case, a synovial joint in four cases and a third type in four cases, the joint being an intermediate structure made of a disc containing a more or less extensive cleft, parallel to the end plates, and bordered by annular fibres or synovial cells (Maigne et al 1992). This intermediate state was not found in the intercoccygeal joints. It is not known if young individuals show the same distribution or not, i.e. if a sacrococcygeal joint can be transformed from one form to another during a person's lifetime.  A fourth type exists, in the form of ossification. Ossification can involve only the sacrococcygeal joint. Studying two different populations, the frequency of this type was found in 22 and 68% of the cases by Saluja (1988). In some of our patients, the whole coccyx was ossified.  The physiologic movements of the coccyx are restricted to flexion and extension. Active flexion (movement in a forward direction) is performed by the levator ani and the sphincter ani externus muscles. Extension (movement in a backward direction) is due to relaxation of these muscles and to the increased intra-abdominal pressure which occurs during defecation and parturition (Smout 1969). It is a passive movement. Surprisingly, the movements of the coccyx in the sitting posture have never been reported in the literature to our knowledge. Flexion or extension can be encountered. Passive flexion is due to the direct pressure of the seat over the coccyx. In other cases, a passive extension is encountered, which is due to an increased intra-pelvic and abdominal pressure by the seat. The direction is depending on the coccygeal anatomy. The intervening factors are : 1) The angle between the sacrum and the coccyx (an acute angle makes the coccyx prone to flex, a flat angle makes it more prone to extend). 2) The sagittal pelvic rotation when sitting (a high degree of pelvic rotation when sitting brings the coccyx parallel to the seat, leading to flexion, a low rotation let it more or less vertical, prone to extension). 3) The body mass index, which is closely related to the pelvic rotation and 4) The angle of coccygeal incidence, which is also related to the pelvic rotation (see below).  In other cases, the coccyx is not mobile when sitting (more frequently in males). This may sometimes (but not always) be attributed to a joint ossification.  Technique of dynamic films The standard way to X-ray the coccyx is to take the film in the standing position. I coined the word ""dynamic exploration"" for the comparison between a standard film and a ""dynamic film"", in a sitting (painful) position. The first (standard) film is taken in the lateral standing position. In order for the coccyx to be in a neutral position, it is very important for the patient to avoid sitting for the five to ten minutes preceding the X-rays examination. Otherwise, in some cases of hypermobility or luxation, there is not time enough for the coccyx to come back into the neutral position. The second (dynamic) film is taken laterally while asking the patient to sit on a hard stool with the back slightly extended from a sitting position, in a posture in which the pain is most pronounced (figure 1). It is mandatory to wait a few minutes for the pain to occur. If the pain is not present, no sound conclusion should be drawn.   Figure 1. The correct position to X-ray the coccyx in a sitting posture. Note the foot rest.   Both films are superimposed on a bright light in order to compare and measure movement of the coccyx. The shapes of the two sacrum should correspond exactly, in order to evidence the coccygeal mobility. Only its mobile portion is considered, the saccrococcygeal disc being sometimes ossified or not mobile. This movement is measured in degrees of flexion or extension (figure 2).   Figure 2. Range of motion of the coccyx is measured in degrees (angle ABC). Bold line : standard film. Dotted line : coccyx in the sitting position. A : apex of the angle located at the caudal part of the sacrum (or of the first coccygeal vertebra if the sacro-coccygeal disc is ossified). The subject is facing to the right, the opposite of figure 1.   In a first study (Maigne et al 1994), the films of 51 patients and controls were compared and read by two independent observers at two different time intervals, the second reading performed one month later. The final value used was the average of the four separate readings. Inter- and intraobserver variations of the angle measurement were 12.5% and 15.3% respectively, and the accuracy of the measurement technique was +/- 2.6 degrees. This is therefore a reliable technique, in particular in view of the definition of hypermobility (see below).  The mobility of the normal coccyx In a control group consisting of 47 pain free volunteers with no history of local trauma and no more than two pregnancies (Maigne et al 1994), the mean mobility (flexion or extension) was 9.3+/-5.7 degrees (range from 0 to 22 degrees). Thirteen coccyges (27.6%) had an extension between 5 and 15 degrees and eight (17%) a flexion between 5 and 22 degrees. Twenty-four (51%) others had a very limited mobility between 0 and 5 degrees. In two cases, there was a slight (asymptomatic) backward slipping of less than 20% (one fifth of the AP diameter of the vertebra).  Allowing for a certain degree of non pathologic variation, we therefore consider that flexion larger than 25-30 degrees represents hypermobility and slipping larger than 25% represents luxation. Extension larger than 15-20 degrees is also pathologic, but it is a very rare situation.  Whether coccyges flex or extend in the sitting position (in controls and in patients) is based upon their position related to the horizontal plane of the seat at the very moment when the pelvis reaches the seat. If the coccyx is near a vertical position (related to the seat), the increase of the pelvic pressure will push it backward (extension). However, if the coccyx is near the horizontal position (i.e. parallel to the seat), the pelvic pressure will have no effect on it. It is the direct pressure exerted by the seat which pushes it forward (into flexion). The angle between the mobile coccyx and the horizontal is the coccygeal incidence. An approximate value of this angle can be calculated on the dynamic film (figure 3). If this angle is larger than 35 degrees, the coccyx is likely to extend when sitting. Under 12 degrees, it will flex. Between 12 and 35 degrees, 61% of the coccyges had flexion, and 39% extension in our study (Maigne et al, 1996).   Figure 3. Measure of the coccygeal incidence. A : standing film. B : sitting film, showing a normal flexion. C : measure of the angle (i); this angle reflects the theoretical position that the mobile part of the coccyx would take if the subject was ""sitting without the seat"", that is without any force acting on it.  M = coccygeal mobility, the angle by which the coccyx has rotated relative to the sacrum. SPR = saggital pelvic rotation, the angle by which the pelvis has rotated in going from standing to sitting.   The coccyx in common coccygodynia: observed radiologic lesions Standard and lateral sitting radiographs of more than 700 patients suffering from common coccygodynia for at least 2 months duration have been made since 1992. Four series of different patients have been currently published, allowing some firm conclusions on the pathology of the coccyx.  Posterior luxation and subluxation: Sagittal luxation of all or part of the mobile portion of the coccyx while in the sitting position is the most striking abnormality observed (figure 4). It is noticed in 20 to 25% of the cases. The sacrococcygeal disc and the first intercoccygeal disc are equally affected. This luxation is spontaneously reduced in the standing position. In some very rare cases, it is permanent.   Figure 4. Luxation of the first mobile vertebra in the sitting position (right). Standard film on the left. The subject is facing to the left, as in figure 1.   Such a lesion is never observed in pain free controls and there is no doubt about its role in coccydynia.  Patients with luxation have certain characteristics, which set them apart from those with normal dynamic films. Their Body Mass Index is statistically higher. A history of direct and violent traumatism on the coccyx prior to the pain is more often found. An acute pain while passing from the sitting to the standing position, more intense than the u",,,,,,,,
Two temporal channels underlie the dynamic motion after effect,243,"Purpose: To characterise the temporal tuning of the motion aftereffect (MAE) using temporally filtered dynamic random noise (DRN). Methods: Adaptation to orthogonal bivectorial motion was used to produce the MAEs, whose direction was measured. Adapting speeds were either: 1.5 & 6, 1.5 & 24, or 6 & 24 deg/s. Each speed pair was tested with DRN filtered into one of 5 octave-width passbands with centre frequencies: 1.1, 2.1, 4.3, 8.5 & 17 Hz. MAE directions were then re-measured using DRN interleaved with a static noise pattern. Finally, MAEs were measured on a static-only noise pattern. Results: Dynamic only: MAE direction for the 4-octave speed difference (1.5/24 deg/s) changed smoothly from opposite the slower vector to opposite the faster vector as test temporal frequency increased. The 2-octave speed pairs also varied smoothly with test frequency but over smaller directional ranges. Static only: MAE direction for static test patterns was directly opposite the slower vector for the 1.5/24 & 6/24 deg/s pairs, and opposite the vector sum for the 1.5/6 deg/s pair. Dynamic+static: Interleaving a static component with the temporally filtered DRN had little or no effect on MAE direction. Conclusions The asymmetries in the dynamic-only conditions fit a two-channel model of temporal processing, comprising a low-pass and a high, bandpass channel. Dynamic MAEs seem to reflect the combined adaptation in both channels. The static MAE behaves quite differently and does not appear to interact with the dynamic MAE, being possibly mediated by mechanisms in the form pathway.",,,,,,,,10.1167/2.7.373
Directional sensitivity of velocity sense in the lumbar spine,244,"Regulating spinal motion requires proprioceptive feedback. While studies have investigated the sensing of static lumbar postures, few have investigated sensing lumbar movement speed. In this study, proprioceptive contributions to lateral trunk motion were examined during paraspinal muscle vibration. Seventeen healthy subjects performed lateral trunk flexion movements while lying prone with pelvis fixed. A 44.5-Hz vibratory stimulus was applied to the paraspinal muscles at the L3 level. Subjects attempted to match target paces of 9.5, 13.5, and 17.5 deg/s with and without paraspinal muscle vibration. Vibration of the paraspinal musculature was found to result in slower overall lateral flexion. This effect was found to have a greater influence in the difference of directional velocities with vibration applied to the left musculature. These changes reflect the sensitivity of lumbar velocity sense to applied vibration leading to the perception of faster muscle lengthening and ultimately resulting in slower movement velocities. This suggests that muscle spindle organs modulate the ability to sense velocity of motion and are important in the control of dynamic motion of the spine. © 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.",,,,,,,,10.1123/jab.24.3.244
Design and demonstration of a new instrumented spatial linkage for use in a dynamic environment: Application to measurement of ankle rotations during snowboarding,245,"Joint injuries during sporting activities might be reduced by understanding the extent of the dynamic motion of joints prone to injury during maneuvers performed in the field. Because instrumented spatial linkages (ISLs) have been widely used to measure joint motion, it would be useful to extend the functionality of an ISL to measure joint motion in a dynamic environment. The objectives of the work reported by this paper were to (i) design and construct an ISL that will measure dynamic joint motion in a field environment, (ii) calibrate the ISL and quantify its static measurement error, (iii) quantify dynamic measurement error due to external acceleration, and (iv) measure ankle joint complex rotation during snowboarding maneuvers performed on a snow slope. An ""elbow-type"" ISL was designed to measure ankle joint complex rotation throughout its range (±30 deg for flexion/extension, ±15 deg for internal/external rotation, and ±15 deg for inversion/eversion). The ISL was calibrated with a custom six degree-of-freedom calibration device generally useful for calibrating ISLs, and static measurement errors of the ISL also were evaluated. Root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) were 0.59 deg for orientation (1.7% full scale) and 1.00 mm for position (1.7% full scale). A custom dynamic fixture allowed external accelerations (5 g, 0-50 Hz) to be applied to the ISL in each of three linear directions. Maximum measurement deviations due to external acceleration were 0.05 deg in orientation and 0.10 mm in position, which were negligible in comparison to the static errors. The full functionality of the ISL for measuring joint motion in a field environment was demonstrated by measuring rotations of the ankle joint complex during snowboarding maneuvers performed on a snow slope.

Failure observations and mechanical modeling,246,"Mechanical simulation and modeling play increasingly important roles in semiconductor industry. It provides guidelines on material selection, package geometry configuration, and package platform selection. It also provides insights and predictions on package reliability and failure mechanisms. Many mechanical models on reliability and failure issues aim directly at observed failures, such as solder cracks or die cracks. Simulations based on straightforward observations from failures are often correct, but not always. For example, failure analysis (FA) photos are usually taken at room temperature showing a static failure moment. This may not provide true ""failure mode"" at the failure temperature, and may miss the dynamic motion of the procedure. Therefore, the observed failures need to be carefully analyzed to discover the true failure mode and failure mechanism. These analyses may lead to different failure mechanism and result in simulations of different focus for improvements. This paper provides a few examples on semiconductor package failures and the analysis processes:how the FA photos lead to the discovery of the true failure mechanisms and how FEM simulation helped solving these issues. © 2010 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICEPT.2010.5582873
Covered body analysis in application to patient monitoring,247,"Patient monitoring in medical applications such as diagnosis of sleep disorders commonly adopts invasive monitoring equipments such as pulse oximetry and polysomnogram (PSG), but their attachment to the patient's body disturb sleep and therefore compromise results. Furthermore, the invasive approaches often fail to monitor continuously because the devices can be pulled off by the subject during sleep unconsciously. This paper presents an automated noninvasive video monitoring approach to analyze (covered) human activity in conditions with persistent heavy occlusion. The proposed method is a model-based approach, employing both static shape features and dynamic motion features to suppress false positive detection, to identify human activity, and to self-improve the covered human pose estimation.

Achievement of precise edge shapes of silicon wafers with double-layered polishing pads (Improvement of edge flatness based on static/dynamic model),248,"Recently the achievement of further high flatness of workpiece is strongly required in mirror finishing. Especially the edge roll off of silicon wafers as the substrates of semiconductor devices is demanded to decrease in polishing process for raising the yield of IC chips. However, the conventional polishing pad cannot meet the demand. In the previous study, a double-layered polishing pad having extra-fine fiber layer as upper layer and hard polymer layer as lower layer was developed to overcome the problem and it was found that the pad brought the high-flat edge and high finishing efficiency. In this study, constitution of the polishing pad was analyzed and investigated by using finite element method of a polishing model and considering the relative dynamic motion between the pad and the workpiece for improving the edge flatness further. A series of polishing experiments for silicon wafers revealed that the flatness of the edge shape is improved significantly with the newly developed pad based on the analytical results.",,,,,,,,10.1299/kikaic.76.981
Efficient design parameter optimization for musculoskeletal bipedal robots combining simulated and hardware-in-the-loop experiments,249,"The design and tuning of bio-inspired musculoskeletal bipedal robots with tendon driven series elastic actuation (TD-SEA) including biarticular structures is more complex than for conventional rigid bipedal robots. To achieve a desired dynamic motion goal additional hardware parameters (spring coefficients, rest lengths, lever arms) of both, the TD-SEAs and the biarticular structures, need to be adjusted. Furthermore, the biarticular structures add correlations over multiple joints which increase the complexity of tuning of these parameters. Parameter adaption and tuning is needed to fit active and passive dynamics of the actuators and the control system. For the considered class of musculoskeletal bipedal robots no fully satisfying systematic approach to efficiently tune all of these parameters has been demonstrated yet. Conventional approaches for tuning of hardware parameters in rigid robots are either simulation based or use a hardware-in-the-loop optimization. This paper presents a new approach to efficiently optimize these parameters, by combining the advantages of simulation-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop optimizations. Grahical interpretation of suitable metrics, like resulting quality values, are used to interpret the simulation results in order to efficiently guide the hardware experiments. By carefully considering the simulation results and adjusting the sequence of robot experiments based on biomechanical insights, the required number of hardware experiments can be significantly reduced. This approach is applied to the musculoskeletal BioBiped2 robot where the hardware parameters of the elastic actuation of the Gastrocnemius and Soleus structures are optimized. A comparison with a state-of-the-art hardware-in-the-loop optimization method demonstrates the efficiency of the presented approach.",,,,,,,,10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363581
Unsteady boundary layer measurement on an oscillating (pitching) supercritical airfoil in compressible flow using multiple hot-film sensors,250,"Aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil in a dynamic motion are highly affected by the behavior of the viscous boundary layer. Boundary layer condition, and the related phenomena, depends on such different parameters as the oscillation type, flight Mach number, angle of attack, etc. In compressible and transonic regimes, the shock-boundary layer interaction causes complex phenomena such as -shock and separation bubble on the airfoil. When oscillation and unsteady effects are also added, a complicated flow is resulted which could not be easily investigated using theoretical and computational methods. Therefore, in this paper a series of static and dynamic (pitch) tests at pre stall angle of attacks were performed in a high speed wind tunnel to study the steady and unsteady behavior of the compressible boundary layer. Measurements involved pressure coefficient distribution and qualitative analysis of output voltage of hot films. Some sinusoidal pitching motions were performed on the SC (2)-0410 airfoil at Mach numbers of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 with the maximum Reynolds number of 8.8 million per meter. The effects of compressibility, reduced frequency, mean angle and oscillation amplitude and free stream Mach number were investigated. Results show asymmetry between transition and relaminarization during pitching motion, and delay in transition with respect to steady conditions. Also, the location of the shock, shock induced separation bubble, and their motions due to the change of instantaneous angle of attack were detected and interpreted using the outputs of hot-film sensors.",,,,,,,,10.1177/0954410014560380
Identification of the glenohumeral joint rotation centre : an MRI validation study,251,"Normal and pathological upper limb movement assessments rely on the valid and reliable identification of the glenohumeral joint centre of rotation (GHJ). However, clarifying the most suitable techniques to identify and reference this location has proved a challenge, and performing a variety of methods that lack validation is commonplace. This may not only be erroneous, but also prevents the standardised collection of upper limb biomechanical information. The principle aim of this research was to clarify the accuracy and reliability of various methods of GHJ identification, including both predictive and functional techniques, as well as the error associated with referencing the GHJ location during dynamic movement trials. Predictive methods of GHJ identification rely on a generic relationship between the GHJ position and predetermined anatomical distances or locations. The ISB recommended predictive method was developed and validated using cadavers, and it appears that a number of convenient, yet to be validated methods are routinely performed in preference of this recommended technique. In the present study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilised to validate, in viv o, the accuracy of various predictive approaches; the ISB recommended method and a representative sample of commonly used techniques. A new multiple linear regression model and simple 3D offset method, were developed from the MRI identified locations of the GHJ and the surface markers. The results indicated that the new multiple linear regression model (13 ±4.6) mm and simple 3D offset (12 ±4.6 mm) found an average GHJ location closer to the MRI determined location than any of the established predictive methods (14-50 mm), including the ISB recommended method (32 ±8.2 mm), and a recently publicised amended 2nd version (16 ±8.4 mm). The reliability analysis revealed that the new regression model had significantly lower inter-tester error (6 ±4 mm) than the other examined predictive methods (13-22 mm), and was therefore recommended for use. A previous cadaveric investigation found that a single, fixed, rotation point could be calculated from humeral movements, and this location was equivalent to the geometric centre of the humeral head. This provided the rationale used to support the use of functional methods of GHJ identification during 3D motion analysis with surface landmarks. However, these techniques rely on a kinematic movement trial to calculate the GHJ location, such that the known soft tissue artifact error affecting the upper arm may result in inaccuracies in their calculations. Therefore, the GHJ calculated from a representative sample of the most reliable, currently used functional algorithms, was compared with the MRI determined GHJ centre location. Following the identification of the optimal marker set for each functional algorithm, their reliability was compared. It was found that the algebraic sphere fit algorithm was less reliable than a geometric sphere fit algorithm or transformation algorithm. The transformation and geometric sphere fit algorithms demonstrated that the centre of rotation could be very reliably calculated from four repeat stereophotogrammetric data collections and a range of upper limb movements. However, the accuracy comparison indicated that the GHJ determined using functional methods was not equivalent to the geometric centre of the humeral head identified in MRI. For instance when the optimal algorithm (geometric sphere fit), marker set and movement trial were used in the functional approach, average in viv the error reported by the most accurate and reliable predictive method (13 ±4.6 mm). A further investigation aimed to determine the most suitable location to reference the GHJ during dynamic motion analysis trials. The GHJ was referenced in a number of upper arm and acromion technical coordinate systems (TCSs) in a series of static MRIs. This permitted the error associated with each set of markers to be calculated in viv oaccuracy errors of 27 ±8.6 mm were reported, around half o. The results indicated that a combination of TCSs defined from two sets of markers; one placed on the acromial plateau and one located proximally on the upper arm, produced the most accurate results, recording an average of 18 ±4 mm of error following a large humeral elevation (up to 180°). Furthermore, a distal upper arm set of markers proved to be inappropriate for GHJ referencing, reporting average errors greater than 30 cm in two large humeral elevations. Therefore, following the identification of the GHJ, its 3D location should be referenced in the average of two TCSs determined from respective sets of markers placed on the acromion and proximal upper arm, during dynamic trials.",,,,,,,,
Modeling of object movement capability in the spinal cord injured population,252,"Static biomechanical modeling has revealed that human reaching and object movement capabilities are dependent on both torso and upper extremity muscle strengths, and the ability to maintain balance throughout the movement. This paper describes data and biomechanical models that can be used to understand the dynamic motions of people with and without thoracic level spinal cord injuries (SCIs) while moving objects around in their environments. This paper also discusses how data gathered in the Human Motion Simulation (HUMOSIM) Laboratory from volunteer subjects performing various seated tasks are used in multi-joint inverse biomechanical models to predict both shoulder moments and body center of pressure locations. The results demonstrate that when symptomatic control subjects moved a box from a small table in front of them to a shoulder-high shelf, it was performed in a smooth fashion that could be well modeled and understood with the use of sequential static biomechanical models. The motions of those subjects with thoracic and high lumbar level SCIs, however, contained an additional dynamic component. The dynamic component revealed that healthy, active SCI subjects were quite capable of extending the distance over which they can move objects to rigid shelves by using a ballistic motion technique. This dynamic motion allows them to move objects to shelves located over twice the distance predicted by static models of such motions, but also raises questions of safety due to falling forward if the object being moved does not land securely on the shelf. These types of motions also are shown to cause much higher (by about 30%) shoulder moments, thus raising the risk of injury to shoulder tissues in people with SCIs.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.ergon.2003.04.001
MEMS IMU sensor orientation algorithms-comparison in a simulation environment,253,"Accurate and precise estimation of orientation from low cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) is a challenge due to the influence of noises from the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. For practical applications, it would be useful to first quantify the expected error in estimated orientation for a known noise associated with a sensor so as to make an optimal selection of a sensor and fusion algorithm based on application requirement. There are a wide range of sensor fusion algorithms in literature to make these angular measurements from MEMS based IMUs. This paper proposes use of a simulation platform for comparative performance assessment of orientation algorithms for 9 axis IMUs in presence of internal noises and demonstrates with examples the benefits of the same. The simulated accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer signals in the IMU are perturbed with white Gaussian noise and bias instability. The effects of these noisy inputs on the orientation output of algorithms are calculated using MATLAB, under static as well as three types of dynamic motion profiles. The best choice of algorithm is determined by comparing the mean value and standard deviation of the shortest angle measure between the true orientation and estimated orientation from multiple simulations for each of the algorithms under evaluation. Among the four orientation algorithms compared here, the Mahony orientation algorithm produced good results for all simulations of static and dynamic motion profiles with an error less than 8° for the sensor modeled in simulation platform over the duration of the simulation.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICNEWS.2018.8904029
Rigid body motions estimation using inertial sensors: Bio-logging application,254,"Bio-logging is a new interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of animal behavior and bioengineering. It can involve several applications such as determination of specific parameters measurements (attitude, acceleration, and position) via a new generation of adapted-animal mechatronic systems (a.d.a.m.s.). The aim of this paper concerns the animal motion estimation problem using lowcost Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (M.E.M.S.) sensors fusion. Generally, accurate attitude measurements are obtained using low-pass sensors such as accelerometers and magnetometers, but at quasi-static motion. In this work a state estimation algorithm is proposed, it is based on a combination of an observer and an iterated Least Squares Algorithm (I.L.S.A.). This approach fuses data from 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, and 3-axis gyroscope to provide the best attitude estimation when the rigid body is both in static and dynamic motion. A correction stage is introduced to take into account the linear acceleration effect undergone by the rigid body. Finally, some simulation and preliminary experimental results are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2009 IFAC.",,,,,,,,10.3182/20090812-3-DK-2006.0034
Adaptive-gain complementary filter of inertial and magnetic data for orientation estimation,255,"Accurate estimation of orientation based on data from small low-cost strapdown inertial and magnetic sensors is often inaccurate during highly dynamic motion or when trying to track movements that include two or more periods characterized by significantly different frequencies. This paper presents a complementary filtering algorithm for estimating orientation based on inertial/magnetic sensor measurements. The algorithm takes advantage of the complementary nature of the information offered by high-frequency angular rate sensor data and low-frequency accelerometers and magnetometers. The filtering algorithm utilizes a single gain that can be adaptively adjusted to achieve satisfactory performance while tracking two or more different types of motion. An additional feature of our approach involves the simple estimation of the gyro bias during periods exhibiting low dynamics and its subsequent use to correct the instantaneous gyro measurements. Simulation and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the algorithm during slow or nearly static movements, as well as, those which are highly dynamic. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm is able to track pitch and roll during dynamic motion with an RMS error of less than two degrees This is believed to be superior to current proprietary commercial algorithms. © 2011 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979957
Dynamic motion learning for multi-DOF flexible-joint robots using active–passive motor babbling through deep learning,256,"This paper proposes a learning strategy for robots with flexible joints having multi-degrees of freedom in order to achieve dynamic motion tasks. In spite of there being several potential benefits of flexible-joint robots such as exploitation of intrinsic dynamics and passive adaptation to environmental changes with mechanical compliance, controlling such robots is challenging because of increased complexity of their dynamics. To achieve dynamic movements, we introduce a two-phase learning framework of the body dynamics of the robot using a recurrent neural network motivated by a deep learning strategy. The proposed methodology comprises a pre-training phase with motor babbling and a fine-tuning phase with additional learning of the target tasks. In the pre-training phase, we consider active and passive exploratory motions for efficient acquisition of body dynamics. In the fine-tuning phase, the learned body dynamics are adjusted for specific tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving dynamic tasks involving constrained movement requiring interactions with the environment on a simulated robot model and an actual PR2 robot both of which have a compliantly actuated seven degree-of-freedom arm. The results illustrate a reduction in the required number of training iterations for task learning and generalization capabilities for untrained situations.",,,,,,,,10.1080/01691864.2017.1383939
Dynamic Visual Motion Estimation,257,"Visual motion is the projection of scene movements on a visual sensor. It is a rich source of information for the analysis of a visual scene. Especially for dynamic vision systems the estimation of visual motion is important because it allows to deduce the motion of objects as well as the self-motion of the system relative to the environment. Therefore, visual motion serves as a basic information for navigation and exploration tasks, like obstacle avoidance, object tracking or visual scene decomposition into static and moving parts.

For each script, the static features like the normalized central moments (NCM) and the normalized Fourier descriptors (NFD) are compared to the dynamic features like the speed of writing individual scripts. In both cases the data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and comparison steps are analyzed and discussed.

Using recurrent artificial neural network model to estimate voluntary elbow torque in dynamic situations,259,"Muscle modelling is an important component of body segmental motion analysis. Although many studies had focused on static conditions, the relationship between electromyographic (EMG) signals and joint torque under voluntary dynamic situations has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) under voluntary dynamic situations for torque estimation of the elbow complex. EMG signals together with kinematic data, which included angle and angular velocity, were used as the inputs to estimate the expected torque during movement. Moreover, the roles of angle and angular velocity in the accuracy of prediction were investigated, and two models were compared. One model used EMG and joint kinematic inputs and the other model used only EMG inputs without kinematic data. Six healthy subjects were recruited, and two average angular velocities (60° s-1 and 90° s-1) with three different loads (0 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg) in the hand position were selected to train and test the RANN between 90° elbow flexion and full elbow extension (0°). After training, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with EMG and joint kinematic inputs in the training data set and the test data set, were 0.17 ± 0.03 Nm and 0.35 ± 0.06 Nm, respectively. The RMSE values between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with only EMG inputs in the training data set and the test set, were 0.57 ± 0.07 Nm and 0.73 ± 0.11 Nm, respectively. The results showed that EMG signals together with kinematic data gave significantly better performance in the joint torque prediction; joint angle and angular velocity provided important information in the estimation of joint torque in voluntary dynamic movement. © IFMBE: 2005.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF02344728
Modeling Maneuverability of Motorized Two-Wheelers during Filtering in Urban Roads,260,"Differences in driving style and static and dynamic attributes of motorized two-wheelers (MTWs) provide MTW riders more flexibility than other traffic in choosing higher speeds, erratic driving patterns, and erratic trajectories. In an attempt to model the unique dynamic movement patterns of MTW riders, the current study investigates the filtering behavior of MTWs, utilizing trajectory data from a six-lane divided urban road. The research work undertaken in this study provides an elaborate investigation of behavioral differences in filtering and following maneuvers, addressing different influential variables that may affect the rider’s decision to perform a filtering maneuver, and describing how this choice is affected by different driver–vehicle characteristics and local traffic conditions. Finally, the multivariate aspects of the riders during filtering are also examined using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Results of the study show that speed of the MTW, average leading vehicles’ speed, available pore size and number of lateral movements made by the MTW rider in the past trajectory are the critical parameters affecting the rider’s choice of filtering. Further, the SEM analysis indicates that the comfort of MTW riders in filtering is dependent on the speed of MTWs and the presence of a surrounding right-hand vehicle.",,,,,,,,10.1177/0361198119842818
A digital optoelectronic method for recording mandibular movement in association with oral electromyograms and temporomandibular joint noises,261,"In order to obtain a better understanding of jaw movement and its relationship to other parameters such as muscle activity or noises from the temporomandibular joint, it is necessary to correlate these activities. A digital optoelectronic method was therefore designed to record these activities simultaneously. It uses a closed-circuit television camera to view the movement of a light source attached to the patient's lower jaw; this is then discriminated and provides an analogue or digital output (x and y axes) based on a matrix of 300 vertical division and 400 horizontal divisions covering an area of 60×80 mm in the recording plane. The recording error for static or dynamic movement is ±2·5% and movement in the z axis increases this by an additional 2·0% per cm z axis movement.

Maintenance in visuo-spatial working memory,262,"Two proposed factors affecting visual working memory maintenance were explored. By means of the dynamic visual noise technique (DVN, Quinn & McConnell, 1996), perceptual structural complexity, and dynamic movement of irrelevant visual information, have been shown to affect memory for subject-generated images, but not for visual inputs. Three experiments manipulated the level of perceptual complexitity (standard DVN vs. dynamic figures, and dynamic vs. static characteristics) of an interfering display, while performing a visual recognition short-term memory task employing novel polygons. Results replicated the lack of standard DVN effect on memory for visual inputs, but showed that an irrelevant visual figure, more structured than standard DVN, decreased performance. Polygon recognition was affected by a static irrelevant visual figure, but was significantly lower when it was dynamic. Interference based on perceptual factors, and spatial displacements of incoming inputs, are discussed within the context of visual working memory mechanisms and architecture.",,,,,,,,10.2117/psysoc.2007.90
Trunk stability in dynamic movement,263,Spinal stability has been characterized in static but not in dynamic movements. The goal of this study was to determine whether movement pace and direction of dynamic trunk flexion influence the control of spinal stability. Twenty healthy subjects performed dynamic lifting movements at 20 and 40 cycles per minute. Lyapunov exponents were calculated from the measured trunk kinematics to estimate stability. Complexity of torso dynamics required at least five embedded dimensions thereby indicating that torso dynamics requires more than the 3-dimensions of movement for sufficient characterization. Dynamic stability is was greater in slow lifting movement than in fast movements. Asymmetric movements demonstrated greater multi-dimensional kinematic divergence than asymmetric movements. This indicates that the sagittal plane of movement may not be a principle dynamic axis of torso movement. Results provide biomechanical insight regarding the role of workplace design and risk of musculoskeletal instability in dynamic lifting tasks.,,,,,,,,10.1177/154193120605001308
The validity of stimulus-evoked EMG for studying muscle fatigue characteristics of paraplegic subjects during dynamic cycling movement,264,"The fatigue characteristics of paralyzed muscles were investigated during dynamic cycling movement induced by functional electrical stimulation (FES). The peak-to-peak (PTP) amplitude of stimulus-evoked electromyogram (EMG), after suppression of stimulus artifact, was adopted as fatigue indicator. Compared to static contraction, the effects of dynamic movement factors on the stimulus-evoked EMG, such as the intermittent stimulation, joint angle, and contraction speed, were first evaluated in separate experiments. The results of isolated tests laid the foundation for interpreting the data obtained in two FES-cycling experiments, performed under maximum stimulation or in controlled cycling speeds. The effects of intermittent stimulation and joint angle caused periodic changes in PTP amplitude which can be alleviated by averaging the PTP amplitude of one cycle. Under the same stimulation intensity, our results indicated that slower muscle contraction speed would have larger PTP amplitude and vice versa. For the limited number of subjects with paraplegia studied, our results showed that the use of EMG PTP as reliable muscle fatigue indicator during dynamic movement is only valid at the same cycling speed or corresponding contraction speed. The decline of the PTP amplitude decreased with the decay of muscle force can be observed during cycling movement; however, reduction of cycling speed had the opposite effect on PTP amplitude. Observations from the hyperbolic modeling of fatigue process demonstrated that the EMG PTP of a fatigued muscle under dynamic movement decreased at a slower rate.",,,,,,,,10.1109/86.593288
Mechanical injury of knee articular cartilage in sports-related exercise and potential post-injury preventative therapy,265,"Background: Chronic overuse or acute injury to the knee has been determined to be a major cause of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Studies have indicated an increased incidence of osteoarthritis in athletes, with or without a history of significant knee injury. Method: This review examines the relationship between physical activity and the onset of articular cartilage damage, which may progress to OA. The contact forces and stresses sustained by the knee joint during dynamic movement in sports is summarized, followed by exploring the potential correlation between these contact loads and impact injury of articular cartilage. Finally, potential modalities to prevent the progression of OA of mechanically injured cartilage are discussed. The articles regarding OA, contact forces and stresses in dynamic movements, and prevention modalities of OA were identified in PubMed databases. Results: Increases in physical demand on the body can have adverse effects on knee joint health, especially during high contact stresses in sports. This was shown by various studies recording changes in knee joint biomarkers, cartilage deformation rates, and cartilage volume after exposing knee joints to a variety of stresses including long distance running or short-term high impact exercises. The data of joint contact force and stress previously reported have indicated a high risk of cartilage injury in high impact sports. Some potential modalities may be able to prevent OA development after performing high impact sport actives. Conclusion: Changes in knee cartilage due to overuse or injury can lead to OA later on in life. Identifying the forces involved at the onset of articular cartilage damage would allow physicians to pinpoint the early stage of articular cartilage damage and provide proper preventive treatments to avoid OA development.",,,,,,,,
An improved calculation method for activity energy expenditure by using PNS,266,"In daily life, walking is one of the most energy consumed activity. There are many researches' focuses on energy expenditure estimation using GPS and 3-axis accelerometer for location tracking and activity monitoring. However, in the case of walking on a slope, GPS location tracking method and 3-axis accelerometer method are failed to estimate the energy consumption while walking on a slope. In this study, we combine the information of GPS in smart phone, the information of foot-mounted IMU and also the slope information from Google elevation database to estimate activity energy expenditure. Energy expenditure in static movement is calculated using accelerometer data. Therefore, the energy expenditure calculator is capable to calculate energy expenditure in static movement and also in dynamic movement. Experiment result shows that the increase in elevation in slope, there is an increase in activity energy expenditure. We also show there is higher energy expenditure when jumping.",,,,,,,,
The relationship between functionality and erector spinae activity in patients with specific low back pain during dynamic and static movements,267,"Background: Alterations in the activity of the lumbar erector spinae (LES) muscles on both sides of the spine have been inconsistently reported in patients with specific low back pain (sLBP) after measuring the muscular activity with surface electromyography (sEMG). It also remains unclear whether these alterations in LES activity can be related to the functional level of patients with sLBP. Research question: This study investigated the LES activity in patients with sLBP during activities of daily living (ADL) which included dynamic and static movement tasks. Moreover, the alterations in LES activity were correlated with the first seven questions of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ-SS). Methods: Thirty patients with specific LBP and twenty healthy subjects were recruited to perform five ADLs including 'static waist flexion’, 'sit to stand’,’ 30-seconds standing’, ‘6-minutes walking’ and ‘climbing stairs’. sEMG sensors were mounted on the left and right LES muscles. The integrated EMG (IEMG) was calculated from the preprocessed sEMG data as statistical comparison criteria. Results: LES activity was significantly higher in patients during 'sit to stand’,’ 30-seconds standing’ and ‘climbing stairs’ and significantly lower during 'static waist flexion’ compared to healthy controls. All tasks showed a significant correlation with the ZCQ-SS score except for ‘6-minutes walking’, whereby LES activity and ZCQ-SS score correspondingly increased during 'sit to stand’ and ‘climbing stairs’ and the LES activity decreased with an increasing ZCQ-SS score during 'static waist flexion’ and’ 30-seconds standing’. Significance: There was a high correlation between alterations in LES activity and the level of functionality in LBP patients. However, the LES activity showed an opposite behavior during static and dynamic movement tasks. The methodology presented can be a useful tool for quantifying improvements in functionality after rehabilitation processes.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2018.08.042
Tactile sensation with high-density pin-matrix,268,"The goal of this research is to investigate the sensation produced with ultimate dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display. It has been a lot of research for tactile display which has many pin-rods moving only in the vertical direction. These systems are typically divided into two types; one type is designed for presenting static shape (such as geometrical or geographical features, characters or icons on the computer screen, etc.) and another type is for displaying patterns changing dynamically. The advantage of passive type is that we can explore the presented texture at our own paces. On the other hand, an advantage of dynamic type is that it can provide richer information than static displays with small presenting area; that is because we need only put our fingers on the top of the display and feel tactile patterns changing automatically. We think this advantage will be important for applying tactile display to usual computer interface or cell phone. Although some previous studies proposed dynamic tactile display with various actuators, these prototypes had their disadvantages such as low response time or low density of pin matrix, and so on. Therefore, it is thought that these tactile displays are still in the early stage. However, we haven't well understood what kind of sensation can be presented with dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display yet. We think that it is not necessarily appropriate approach to evaluate this type of displays after developing them. We believe that we need a novel methodology to design or evaluate dynamic pin-matrix tactile displays before creating them. To investigate the tactile sensation with a high-density Pin-Matrix (PM) type tactile interface, we generated dynamic movement of a non-actuated prototype by moving it over textures etched onto a flat surface. With this method, a human works as a part of actuator, therefore it is unnecessary to add actuator for each pin-rod. Figure 1 shows three types of pin-matrix we created; PM1 has the smallest interval 1.0mm from center to center of the pin-rod, PM2 has 1.5mm pin interval which is approximately as same as the two-point threshold on the fingertip, and PM3 has 2.0mm interval. We made supporting plates with thin bakelite board (thickness: 1.0mm), which has 0.9mm holes for penetrating pin-rods. The bottom of the pin-rod has 0.4mm hemisphere shape, which enables to reduce the effect of the friction dramatically and to go over the texture without tumbling. With this specification, PM can move freely corresponding to the texture surface. We also took the length of spaces placed between two bakelite boards into account in order to keep the movement direction of pin-rods only in the vertical. To investigate how small interval is enough for human to recognize the shapes engraved on the texture, we conducted a psychophysical experiment with touching textures using these PMs. The result showed that the smaller the pin interval becomes, the easier subjects understood what shape was engraved on the textures. In another experiment, we asked subject that the engraved texture is convex or concave. Subjects could easily tell convex from concave, therefore this result might suggest that not only the tangential force but also normal force on finger tip is used for shape recognition. And we also found a kind of edge enhancement effect in using PM, especially in small pin interval. We think this effect might result from an aliasing effect as mentioned in previous study [Kikuuwe et al. 2005], which is caused by discrete sampling of the target texture. We think that our devised method can be broadly used for deciding parameters of pin-matrix type tactile displays for particular application. In our preliminary result we confirmed that subject could easily recognize the shape with 1.0mm interval pin-matrix. Although we need to perform further experiment with smaller pin-rod or smaller pin interval, we can say that current, dynamic pin-matrix type tactile display is not sufficient enough for displaying shapes to finger tip. With the same methodology we proposed, it will be possible to find which pin interval is the most appropriate for a dynamic Braille or a computer interface.

Pre-season screening of core muscle balance and control tests in the lumbar spine in professional road cyclists can we prevent uncontrolled movement?,269,"Background Asymptomatic musculoskeletal function, normal range of joint motion and normal muscle strength are considered not adequate star points to design a prevention injury program. Objective To assess core muscle balance and control in the lumbar spine using simple functional tests during low load activity and high load dynamic movements. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting Professional road cyclists. Patients 51 elite road cyclists were functionally evaluated at the beginning of the 2010 season. All injuries affecting racers during previous seasons were recorded throughout a clinical oriented interview. Interventions Specific assessment of the site (lower back and pelvis) and direction of uncontrolled movement, under low and high loading within functionally orientated tasks. Main outcome measurements Three tests were conducted in the crook laying position: (1) double leg lift and lower, (2) single leg extension, (3) bridge+single leg extension. In two first tests the 'stabilizer' pressure biofeedback unit was used to measure the influence of the global muscle system on trunk stability. Muscle functional extensibility of iliopsoas, tensor fasciae late, anterior rectus femoris and hamstrings were also evaluated. Results Uncontrolled movements in lower back in low load test were found in flexion (57% of cyclist) and extension test (67%). Passive and active restriction of hamstrings while sitting showed significant correlation with impaired low back movements in flexion test (p<0.05). Weakness of the gluteus maximus correlated with uncontrolled movement in low back extension at high loading. Impaired movements in pelvic girdle (70%) showed a statistically significant relationship with asymmetrical passive restriction of rectus anterior muscle (p<0.03). Conclusion Muscle imbalance between hamstrings and hip flexors together with weak hip extensors provoke uncontrolled movements in the low back of cyclists, predisposing them to more overuse injuries. A specific preventive program should be desirable.",,,,,,,,10.1136/bjsm.2011.084038.117
Comparative analysis of cerebellar unit discharge patterns in the decerebrate cat during passive movements,270,"1) The present experiments were undertaken to study how information about the parameters of a passive movement is processed at different neuronal levels of the cat cerebellar cortex. The analysis has been performed by recording extracellularly in the intermediate part of the cerebellar anterior lobe from presumed mossy fibres, presumed granule cells, and Purkinje cells with simple spikes and complex spikes. 2) The discharge patterns obtained during passive movements of the cat's forepaw were characterized by components which could be related to dynamic or static parameters of the movement. With respect to the occurrence of dynamic responses, patterns were classified according to a statistically derived measure in three different types. By using the same statistical measure, discharge patterns were additionally classified into two subgroups according to their response components reflecting static parameters. Within the patterns a clearcut relationship between dynamic and static components was observed. The corresponding distributions are shown and discussed. 3) A very interesting result of the classification of cerebellar discharge patterns is that the distribution of the different types depended on the level of integration within the cerebellar cortex. Patterns of the low scale integrated cerebellar input (mossy fibre-system), as well as those of granule cells (the first cerebellar computational niveau), reflected both static and dynamic movement parameters. At the Purkinje cell level (a level with a high degree of convergence) the discharge patterns are characterized predominantly by dynamic responses. 4) The interrelationship between complex- and simple spikes of Purkinje cells was tested by different methods: a) By analyzing the paired values of the mean complex-(CS) and simple spike (SS) discharge probabilities of 110 Purkinje cells a scatter was obtained, indicating an underlying hyperbolic relation (prob(CS) = a/(prob(SS))b). Thus, a high CS discharge probability is accompanied by a low SS probability and vice versa, b) The timelocked complex- and simple spike responses were studied by comparing the similarity of their responses. All combinations of complex- and simple spike patterns were observed, ranging from a sign correct similarity to a mirror image similarity. The distribution of the measure for similarity shows that the mirror image predominated, c) The individual simple spike discharge probability is characterized by a pause evoked by the occurrence of a complex spike event. The simple spike discharge probabilities during an interval preceeding and following a complex spike event were compared. A post climbing pause coefficient was defined as a measure for the effectiveness of the complex spike event. No relationship between these coefficients and the above mentioned measure for similarity was found. Hence, for the Purkinje cell discharging with the simple spikes independent spike generating processes have to be assumed. 5) From these results it can be derived that cerebellar discharge patterns can be classified with respect to responses to static and dynamic parameters of passive limb movements. Based on this classification it appears that the distribution of responses to static and dynamic parameters depends on the computational level within the cerebellar cortex. If both static and dynamic parameters are conveyed by a single unit, a clear relationship between the response components could be observed. However, this effect was independently found at all cerebellar cortical computational levels indicating a functional principle of processing a pair of movement parameters. The interrelation of complex- and simple spike responses to passive movement was further studied. Since transients of complex- and simple spike patterns were observed ranging from two almost identical patterns to mirror image like patterns, it is assumed that under physiological conditions one of the tasks of the climbing fibre system consists of tuning the simple spike discharge according to the peripheral requirements. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF00248789
Visual representations and mental models: Thinking about probability,271,"Knowledge can be delivered to learners through different types of representations—plain text or visual format, static or animated format, and passive or interactive format. Types of representations profoundly impact learning performance. In other words, different types of representations shape how people comprehend the knowledge. How people comprehend the knowledge influences the way they reason. This research aimed to investigate whether different types of representations influence learning and to examine why and how the representations affect learning.    Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of computer animations in different instructional environments. Visual representations are considered to be effective modes of depicting information in instructional technology environments. Mental model theory offers a useful lens for examining how and why visual representations lead to better reasoning ability. The objectives of this research are to (1) explore how levels of interactivity and dynamism of representations in probability influence levels of dynamism in student mental models of probability and (2) investigate whether levels of dynamism in mental models influence probability reasoning. The software presents probability problems in five representations—Standard Text representation (ST), Static Visual representation (SV), Computer-Animated representation (CA), Interactive Computer-Animated representation (ICA), and Static Visual representation with Motion Cues (SV-MC).    There are three major findings. First, students who received visual representations outperformed students who received ST representation. The results support that visual representations have positive effects on students' learning performance. Second, the results show that higher levels of dynamism of representations (i.e. CA, ICA, and SV-MC representations) generated a greater number of images in learners' mental models. This leads to conclude that higher levels of dynamic movement of representational resources foster flexible and dynamic mental models that allow for better reasoning about probability. Third, the SV-MC and CA groups performed similarly and both outperformed other groups. However, on more complex problem sets, the SV-MC group outperformed all other groups. This finding suggests that movements that learners have to create on their own simulate higher levels of dynamism in mental models than movements that the computer generated for them.",,,,,,,,
Takete and Maluma in action: A cross-modal relationship between gestures and sounds,272,"Despite Saussure's famous observation that sound-meaning relationships are in principle arbitrary, we now have a substantial body of evidence that sounds themselves can have meanings, patterns often referred to as ""sound symbolism"". Previous studies have found that particular sounds can be associated with particular meanings, and also with particular static visual shapes. Less well studied is the association between sounds and dynamic movements. Using a free elicitation method, the current experiment shows that several sound symbolic associations between sounds and dynamic movements exist: (1) front vowels are more likely to be associated with small movements than with large movements; (2) front vowels are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (3) obstruents are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (4) voiced obstruents are more likely to be associated with large movements than with small movements. All of these results are compatible with the results of the previous studies of sound symbolism using static images or meanings. Overall, the current study supports the hypothesis that particular dynamic motions can be associated with particular sounds. Building on the current results, we discuss a possible practical application of these sound symbolic associations in sports instructions.",,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0163525
Motion analysis system for the ergonomic assessment of manufacturing and assembly manual activities,273,"The environment of manufacturing and assembly manual activities radically evolved in the last decades. First, the western world workforce is alarmingly aging. In the last 15 years the percentage of European employees older than 50 years rose from 21.6% to 30.4%. Furthermore, the latest developments in legislations (EU Machinery directive, 2006/42/EC, 89/391/EEC, Occupational Safety and Health act) force the companies to assess, monitor and safeguard the health of their operators. Finally, an increasing pressure from the civil society and the stakeholders pretends safe working conditions in manufacturing and assembly processes. This paper tackles these issues proposing an original Motion Analysis System (MAS) for the ergonomic assessment of human operators involved in industrial processes. This research exploits different motion capture (MOCAP) technologies, e.g. optical, inertial and miscellaneous, to register the static postures and the dynamic movements of an operator during manufacturing or assembly activities. The information provided by the MOCAP technologies about the evolution over time of the position and orientation of the skeleton segments are processed by the MAS. This system calculates for each monitored frame the angle values of all the relevant joints of the human body accurately reproducing the operator movements. Furthermore, the MAS assesses the risk of musculoskeletal disorders of the performed manufacturing and assembly activities with the automatic evaluation of three ergonomic indices considering the features of the products and tools which the operator pick and handle. Along with the calculation of REBA and OWAS indices, an original one is developed and proposed based on the ISO 11226:2000 norm. The MAS is tested and validated with the industrial case study of a gearbox assembly process comparing the novel ergonomic index with the traditional ones. The results suggest that the proposed index accurately evaluates the ergonomic risk of specific assembly tasks compared to the classical approaches.",,,,,,,,
Detecting pathological speech using contour modeling of harmonic-to-noise ratio,274,"This paper proposes a new feature extraction method for automatically detecting pathological voice in a normal conversation scenario. Unlike conventional approaches that utilize the static harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) characteristics of sustained vowel, the proposed method considers the dynamic movements of articulatory organs depending on the types of phonations. Assuming those movements reflect the health status of subjects, the proposed method utilizes the characteristics of HNR contour within a single sentence-level speech signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the classification error rate by 35.2 % (relative) compared to the conventional method. © 2014 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854749
基于三轴加速度传感器人体姿态识别的特征选择,275,"In order to solve the problem of activity classification in human motion pattern recognition, the feature selection of human activity recognition is studied in detail. By taking signal statistics on the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis, 117 features such as standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are obtained. The three algorithms of Fisher score, Relief-F and Chi square are combined with the hierarchical classification method to select the feature subset, and the action classification is conducted by using the support vector machine (SVM). Experiments showed that the feature set selected by the three feature selection algorithms helps to identify three static movements of standing, sitting and lying and three dynamic movements of walking, going upstairs and downstairs with high precision, which is conducive to the subsequent research on low complexity online identification method.",,,,,,,,10.3969/j.issn.0255-8297.2019.03.013
INFLUENCE OF POSTACTIVATION POTENTIATION ON SPRINTING PERFORMANCE IN PROFESSIONAL RUGBY PLAYERS,276,"PURPOSE: Postactivation potentiation (PAP), i.e., the increase in twitch torque following a maximal voluntary conditioning contraction, has been shown to depend on muscle contractile conditions (e.g., muscle length). Few studies, however, have investigated the extent of twitch PAP under dynamic conditions in human subjects. Therefore, the aim of the present experiment was to test the twitch PAP during passive dynamic movements following isometric conditioning contractions on nine healthy men. METHODS: Maximal twitches were evoked on the knee extensor muscles before and exactly 5 s after a 3-s conditioning maximal voluntary isometric contraction. PAP was determined at a constant joint angle under isometric conditions, during and immediately after passive shortening and lengthening with slow and fast angular velocities (30 and 150 degrees .s). RESULTS: Our results indicate a significant PAP increase with increasing shortening angular velocity (34.6 +/- 13.2% and 51.9 +/- 21.1% at 30 degrees .s and 150 degrees .s velocities, respectively), whereas PAP was significantly lower during lengthening (15.2 +/- 15.2%) as compared with isometric conditions (28.5 +/- 18.3%). Similar results were obtained when PAP was determined isometrically but immediately following passive shortening or lengthening (30 degrees .s). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that PAP affects dynamic torque production capacity and that PAP is dependent on contractile conditions. Furthermore, the similar extent of PAP during and immediately after passive movements suggests a PAP history dependency. Our results therefore suggest that PAP is recommended more for improving shortening performance than for lengthening.",,,,,,,,10.1519/JSC.0000000000000444
Effect of Loading on In Vivo Tibiofemoral and Patellofemoral Kinematics of Healthy and ACL-Reconstructed Knees,277,"Background: Although knees that have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often exhibit normal laxity on clinical examination, abnormal kinematic patterns have been observed when the joint is dynamically loaded during whole body activity. This study investigated whether abnormal knee kinematics arise with loading under isolated dynamic movements. Hypothesis: Tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics of ACLR knees will be similar to those of the contralateral uninjured control knee during passive flexion-extension, with bilateral differences emerging when an inertial load is applied. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The bilateral knees of 18 subjects who had undergone unilateral ACLR within the past 4 years were imaged by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their knees were cyclically (0.5 Hz) flexed passively. Subjects then actively flexed and extended their knees against an inertial load that induced stretch-shortening quadriceps contractions, as seen during the load acceptance phase of gait. A dynamic, volumetric, MRI sequence was used to track tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics through 6 degrees of freedom. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare secondary tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics between ACLR and healthy contralateral knees during the passive and active extension phases of the cyclic motion. Results: Relative to the passive motion, inertial loading induced significant shifts in anterior and superior tibial translation, internal tibial rotation, and all patellofemoral degrees of freedom. As hypothesized, tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics were bilaterally symmetric during the passive condition. However, inertial loading induced bilateral differences, with the ACLR knees exhibiting a significant shift toward external tibial rotation. A trend toward greater medial and anterior tibial translation was seen in the ACLR knees. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that abnormal knee kinematic patterns in ACLR knees emerge during a simple, active knee flexion-extension task that can be performed in an MRI scanner. Clinical Relevance: It is hypothesized that abnormal knee kinematics may alter cartilage loading patterns and thereby contribute to increased risk for osteoarthritis. Recent advances in quantitative MRI can be used to detect early cartilage degeneration in ACLR knees. This study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying abnormal ACLR kinematics by use of dynamic MRI, supporting the combined use of dynamic and quantitative MRI to investigate the proposed link between knee motion, cartilage contact, and early biomarkers of cartilage degeneration.",,,,,,,,10.1177/0363546517724417
The Effects of Stroboscopic Vision on Drop Landing Kinematics,278,"Introduction: Visual input is a crucial component in the control of human movement. Previous research using vision obstruction (blindfold) demonstrates alterations in landing neuromuscular control that may increase injury risk. Due to the method of limiting vision, these investigations lacked generalizability and sport specificity as the tasks were simple single movements without environmental interaction. The development of stroboscopic glasses that disrupt vision without completely removing it now allows visualmotor assessment during dynamic movements and target acquisition tasks. No research has yet considered the effect of dynamic visual stroboscopic interference on lower extremity kinematics. Purpose: To investigate the effects of interfering with dynamic visual processing on drop vertical jump (DVJ) landing kinematics. Methods: Participants consisted of twenty five NCAA Division I university women's basketball and soccer athletes (20.0±0.97 years, 180.2±12.8 cm, 78.7±16.3 kg). The participants were fitted with a modified PluginGait retroreflective marker set to track 3D kinematics via a Vicon passive optical motion capture system. A 5 minute warm up with the stroboscopic glasses was completed. Participants then completed 3 normal DVJs and 3 wearing stroboscopic glasses. The DVJ consists of leaning forward from a 30.5 cm plyometric box until falling, landing, and then immediately jumping up to a target set at 90% of their maximum vertical jump. Data were processed using Visual 3D software to assess peak knee flexion angles. Change scores were computed using the subtracted average of the normal landings from the stroboscopic landings. A one sample ttest, alpha .05 a priori, was used to determine if the stroboscopic condition altered knee flexion greater than 0 and greater than a previously determined measure of error of 3.2°(Ford, 2007). Data are reported as the mean difference [°]. Results: The stroboscopic condition altered peak knee flexion on the left (4.49±3.27°, p<.0001) and the right (4.22±2.76°, p<.0001) sides. Significance was maintained when analyzed for a difference from 3.2 for left (1.29±0.70°, p<.037) and right (1.01 ± 0.58°, p<.042) sides. Forty four percent had greater than 5° change in peak knee flexion, 20% greater than 8°, while 40% had less than 3.2° change due to the visual disruption. Conclusions: Stroboscopic visual interference affects landing knee flexion mechanics. While the relative overall group change in knee flexion was slight, the stroboscopic condition created a varied response in motor control. These results suggest that even a mild disruption to visualmotor processing can impact landing mechanics. : Presentation Preference (Complete): Unsolicited Podium Presentation (no more than 2 total per speaker) Awards (Complete): I would like to be considered for the PhD Podium Competition: Yes",,,,,,,,
"The effects of hearing impairment, age, and hearing aids on the use of self-motion for determining front/back location",279,"Background: There are two cues that listeners use to disambiguate the front/back location of a sound source: high-frequency spectral cues associated with the head and pinnae, and self-motion-related binaural cues. The use of these cues can be compromised in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids. Purpose: To determine how age, hearing impairment, and the use of hearing aids affect a listener's ability to determine front from back based on both self-motion and spectral cues. Research Design: We used a previously published front/back illusion: signals whose physical source location is rotated around the head at twice the angular rate of the listener's head movements are perceptually located in the opposite hemifield from where they physically are. In normal-hearing listeners, the strength of this illusion decreases as a function of low-pass filter cutoff frequency, this is the result of a conflict between spectral cues and dynamic binaural cues for sound source location. The illusion was used as an assay of self-motion processing in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids. Study Sample: We recruited 40 hearing-impaired participants, with an average age of 62 yr. The data for three listeners were discarded because they did not move their heads enough during the experiment. Data Collection and Analysis: Listeners sat at the center of a ring of 24 loudspeakers, turned their heads back and forth, and used a wireless keypad to report the front/back location of statically presented signals and of dynamically moving signals with illusory locations. Front/back accuracy for static signals, the strength of front/back illusions, and minimum audible movement angle were measured for each listener in each condition. All measurements were made in each listener both aided and unaided. Results: Hearing-impaired listeners were less accurate at front/back discrimination for both static and illusory conditions. Neither static nor illusory conditions were affected by high-frequency content. Hearing aids had heterogeneous effects from listener to listener, but independent of other factors, on average, listeners wearing aids exhibited a spectrally dependent increase in ""front"" responses: the more high-frequency energy in the signal, the more likely they were to report it as coming from the front. Conclusions: Hearing impairment was associated with a decrease in the accuracy of self-motion processing for both static and moving signals. Hearing aids may not always reproduce dynamic self-motion-related cues with sufficient fidelity to allow reliable front/back discrimination.",,,,,,,,10.3766/jaaa.15101
A Cognitive Radar for Classification of Resident Space Objects (RSO) operating on Polarimetric Retina Vision Sensors and Deep Learning,280,"A novel cognitive radar, operating on Polarimetric Dynamic Vision Sensor (pDVS) and deep learning principles, aimed at discriminating moving targets, based on their motion patterns, is presented. The system consists of an asynchronous event-based neuromorphic imaging sensor coupled with polarization filters which enable better discrimination; a spinning light modulating wheel, operating at varying angular frequency, is placed in front of a static object. A pipeline has been designed and implemented in order to train a neural network for motion pattern classification using event data. This pipeline first extracts features using a pre-trained convolutional neural network and then feeds these features into a single-layer long short-term memory recurrent neural network. The outcome of this study indicates that deep learning combined with pDVS principles is well suited to classify accurately motion pattern-based targets using limited set of data; thus opening the way to many innovative bioinspired-based vision applications where feature extraction is complex or precognitive vision-based applications for the detection of salient features. The proposed cognitive radar would be able to operate at high speeds and low bandwidth, while maintaining low storage capabilities, low power consumption, and high-processing speed.",,,,,,,,10.1109/IST48021.2019.9010272
Objective assessment of blinking and facial expressions in Parkinson's disease using a vertical electro-oculogram and facial surface electromyography,281,"Objective: Hypomimia is a common and early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which reduces the ability of PD patients to manifest emotions. Currently, it is visually evaluated by the neurologist during neurological examinations for PD diagnosis, as described in task 3.2 of the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Since such an evaluation is semi-quantitative and affected by inter-variability, this paper aims to measure the physiological parameters related to eye blink and facial expressions extracted from a vertical electro-oculogram (VEOG) and facial surface electromyography (fsEMG) to differentiate PD patients from healthy control subjects (HCs). Approach: The spontaneous eye blink rate-minute (sEBR), its maximum amplitude (BMP), and facial cutaneous muscle activity were measured in 24 PD patients and 24 HCs while the subjects looked at a visual-tester composed of three main parts: static vision, dynamic vision and reading silently. Specificity and sensitivity for each parameter were calculated. Main results: The VEOG and the fsEMG allowed the identification of some parameters related to eye blink and facial expressions (i.e. sEBR, BMP, frontal and peribuccal muscular activities), being able to distinguish between PD patients and HCs with high sensitivity and specificity. Significance: The demonstration that the combination of parameters related to eye blink and facial expressions can discriminate (with high accuracy) between PD patients versus HCs, thus resulting in a useful tool to support the neurologist in objective assessment of hypomimia for improving PD diagnosis.",,,,,,,,10.1088/1361-6579/ab1c05
Visual characteristics of the driver to tunnel group traffic safety,282,"Analyzing the influence of the drivers' visual changes in highway tunnel groups on traffic safety, this paper made a test on 100 drivers' visual characteristics on Tongling to Tangkou (Anhui) expressway traffic tunnel group using the dynamic visual acuity tester. The results showed that: the drivers are relatively prone to accident in the tunnel group environment. After driving through the expressway tunnel group, drivers' dynamic visions are 47.12 percent and even up to 90.18 percent compromised, compared to their respective static vision. According to the gray system, a gray relation analysis model of visual characteristics was established. The results showed that the driving age, driving experience and continuous driving time all had strong correlations with drivers' dynamic vision, in which the continuous driving time dominates other factors. This paper could in theory provide a useful or practical way for the design and safety management of the expressway tunnel group. © 2011 ASCE.",,,,,,,,10.1061/41184(419)497
Dynamic visual acuity during passive and active head thrusts in normal and unilaterally vestibulopathic humans,283,"Visual acuity during head rotation is expected to reflect vestibular performance and compensation strategies. Eleven subjects with unilateral vestibular deafferentation and 15 controls wore best optical correction during manually  imposed and self-generated yaw head thrusts monitored by an angular rate sensor. A high-contrast, white, variable size letter ""E"" on a black background was displayed on a video monitor 6 m distant in one of 4 oblique random orientations only during head motion exceeding thresholds of 50 or 75 degree/s. Subjects indicated optotype orientation in a 4-alternative forced choice. For each movement direction and head velocity threshold, binocular DVA was determined from 30 apprx 40 thrusts as the log of the minimum angle resolvable (logMAR) using a computer-controlled QUEST algorithm (Watson and Pelli, 1979). During manually delivered head thrusts to the intact side, unilaterally deaferented subjects had decreases in DVA from the static condition of  0.36+-0.22 & 0.47+-0.53 logMAR (mean+-SD), respectively, for 50 and 75degree/s thresholds, similar to control values (0.26+-0.13 & 0.36+-0.14). However, during manually delivered head thrusts to the deafferented side, vestibulopathic subjects had decreases in DVA of  0.66+-0.36 & 1.08+-0.47 logMAR, significantly greater than during contralesional thrusts (P<0.005). The directional  difference was significantly reduced during self-generated head thrusts. We conclude that DVA during manually imposed head thrusts could be a useful test for detection, lateralization, and monitoring of vestibular pathology. However, extra-vestibular mechanisms appear to compensate for deficits during self-generated head thrusts.",,,,,,,,
Stereoscopic acuity in ocular pursuit of moving objects,284,"Relatively little parallelism was found to exist between still and moving objects with regard to three-dimensional vision. Hence, additional dynamic vision testing may be necessary. This is true for both dynamic stereoscopy and dynamic parallactoscopy. The binocular rotational prismometer or parallactoscopometer proved to be highly suitable for testing within that context. There are specific situations in transport, occupational, and sports medicines in which stereoacuity should be tested in conjunction with oculomotoricity, taking into due consideration the inseparable physiological links between the two. There are plenty of three-dimensional movements in the human environment and particularly on road traffic, and proper visual perception of movement can be of crucial importance to job performance and to the rate of traffic accidents although systematic studies have not so far been conducted into the stereoscopic pursuit of moving objects. Vision and movement are closely associated with each other. Yet, the movement factor has so far been blotted out, on grounds of practicability, from all investigations on visual power. Still objects were used as optotypes in vision tests, which meant the rejection of job-related and traffic-related analysis. There is no parallelism at all between the vision of still and moving objects. Evidence to that effect has been produced by early studies into monocular dynamic visual acuity (Ludvigh and Miller, 1958; Jaeger and Honegger, 1964). Individuals with good static visual acuity do not necessarily possess good dynamic visual capacity. This is a decisive aspect, no doubt, when it comes to the appraisal of fitness for certain occupational activities. The same applies to dynamic stereoacuity. Dynamic three-dimensional vision is based on two optosensorial capabilities, binocular stereoscopy and movement parallactoscopy or kinetoparallactoscopy, the latter also being possible in a monocular manner. Dynamic stereopsis can be properly measured by means of the recently developed binocular rotational prismometer (see Section 3.1). Its enormous precision has the greatest effect at short distances (not more than 10 m). When it comes to longer distances, vision was found to be more strongly determined by empirical factors of three-dimensional perception and was found to be decisively determined by dynamic parallactoscopy (seeing moving objects on the basis of movement parallax). The latter can be effectively measured by means of a recently devised parallactoscopometer (see Section 3.2). Dynamic stereoacuity is a highly subtle and remarkably sophisticated sensorial achievement of sensitive reactivity. It is based on stereoscopy, binocular fixation, motor and sensory fusion, and the capability of ocular pursuit movement. These basic factors are highly variable, even in normally sighted individuals. Dynamic stereoacuity is characterised by wide variability. However, stereoscopy has its limits, some of them depending on the associative performance of the central nervous system through which two-dimensional images of lateral disparity are transformed to a three-dimensional perception on the retinae of the two eyes. On the basis of movement parallax, i.e. dynamic parallactoscopy, stereopsis has been the phylogenetically earlier and, consequently, more stable visual capacity by which to perceive a three-dimensional situation. Its sensorial accuracy has proved to be very much below that of dynamic stereoscopy in response to slow velocities. But it has been found to assume an absolutely predominant position in response to moderate and high velocities. It is largely based on the capability of fixation in the course of ocular pursuit movement and, if one eye is visually reduced, on the monocular visual acuity or visual acuity of the better eye. These two components of three-dimensional vision and their sensorial capabilities, are not just of interest from the ophthalmological and sensophysiological points of view. They are certainly of particular relevance to occupational and transport medicine. The visual demands made by quite a number of activities and occupations have grown considerably in relation to technological progress (Merte, 1978), and the need is growing for the formulation of specific criteria of occupational fitness, primarily regarding dynamic stereopsis. This particular need had been left unconsidered in almost all national and international programmes of occupational fitness rating, especially in terms of performance-related and methodological rules or regulations (Broschmann, 1981). Stereoacuity for the perception of moving objects should become part of eye testing for quite a number of activities. Any reduction of dynamic stereoacuity may lead to inadequate visual information and may, thus, assume a straightforward relevance to occupational and transport medicine. Individuals who fail to achieve normal performance in three-dimensional orientation are, in a way, handicapped from the very outset, since, in certain situations, they may be unable to do their jobs according to safety regulations or machine specifications. Motorcar driving ranks high among the practice-related aspects of dynamic stereoacuity. Stereoscopically sighted individuals who suddenly become monocular, may lose a great deal of security in road traffic, e.g., in slow convoy driving, pulling into parking gaps, reversing, assessment of short distances, driving on lanes narrowed by parked vehicles, turning into gateways, or overtaking (Aulhorn, 1976). True, there is something like age-dependent gradual adjustment to monocularity (Heydenreich and Wittwer, 1981), which, however, is no substitute for the loss of stereoscopic vision. On the other hand, persons who have turned monocular are at little or no disadvantage at all in moving traffic. Good stereoscopic vision of road traffic is essential within a range of up to 20 m (Broschmann, 1981; Hartmann and Stocker, 1983). Piper (1969) found stereoscopy to be highly important up to 50 m, Heinsius (1964) even up to 90m. Yet, stereoscopic impressions will become unevaluable for practical purposes, if visual targets are located at long distances from the observer. Three-dimensional perception of moving processes in road traffic travelling at high speeds is ensured by movement parallax. It is an advantage in road traffic that the most important objects of observation, other vehicles, are also moving, which provides for the summation of several three-dimensional impressions. In road traffic, stereoscopic vision is simply a complementary, though not unimportant sensorial security (Dubois-Poulsen, 1969; Schumann, 1959; Broschmann, 1977, 1981). Finally, inadequate dynamic stereoscopy is likely to have consequences in terms of driving economy due to less calm and more nervous driving, resulting in too frequent deceleration or acceleration. A train driver, on the other hand, would only have to concentrate on objects straight ahead, so that, to him, dynamic stereoacuity plays an absolutely subordinate role. Again, this does not apply to train drivers involved in shunting (Vesper, 1965). Stereoscopic vision is not absolutely imperative for aircraft pilots. They have to deal exclusively with fast movement and long distances for which kinetoparallactic vision was found to be more important than stereoscopy (Epstein and Tredici, 1973). Accordingly, no insufficiencies were displayed by professional or amateur pilots who had been blindfolded on one eye. Hence, stereoscopy may be rated as some kind of 'luxurious' asset to flyers (Aichmair, 1983; Grosslight, Fletscher, Masterton and Hagen, 1978). How-ever, Mayer and Lane (1973) found that the number of monocular pilots involved in near or actual accidents had been higher than that of pilots with intact stereoscopy. Sport and glider pilots, parachutists, and helicopter pilots, on the other hand, were found to depend strongly on the accurate assessment of moving objects and, thus, on dynamic stereoscopy (Honegger, 1966), a very particular requirement, when it comes to pinpoint landing. Visual senses and oculomotoricity would be overtaxed in all respects, when it comes to sonic or supersonic speed. High cruising speeds would not leave sufficient time for a full processing by visual senses. A flight distance (blind path) of 300 to 500 m was found to lie between retinal irritation and reaction in sonic speed travel, with accommodation, ocular movement, binocular fusion, and fixation being uncounted for. Dynamic stereoacuity plays an important role in several sport disciplines (Romhild, 1983; Trachtmann, 1973). There is an unambiguous need for prompt and accurate three-dimensional localisation in ball games, long and high jump, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, and gliding. Demands for accuracy are continuously arising in top competitive sports, and it would, therefore, be certainly useful to introduce dynamic stereoacuity testing for the selection of athletes in some sports. It should be done at sport centres, prior to specific practice of coaching programmes. Good dynamic stereoacuity will also facilitate grasping, since the human hand movement must be visually controlled (Noll, 1973). The view has been rapidly gaining ground that classical methods of ophthalmology are no longer sufficient for the adequate assessment of sophisticated performances of the visual process (Schober, 1972, 1976) and that examination methods would be needed by which several activities of the central nervous system could be tested and verified in combination (Backman, 1972). The need for testing of dynamic stereoacuity, i.e. dynamic stereoscopy and dynamic parallactoscopy, is, basically, supported by all the reasons given by examiners of monocular dynamic visual acuity and taken by them as the point of departure for their own investigations. The most important of these reasons relates to the existence of only loose correlations between static and dynamic visual activi",,,,,,,,10.1007/bf00162823
ESTABLISHING NORMATIVE CHANGE VALUES IN VISUAL ACUITY LOSS DURING THE DYNAMIC VISUAL ACUITY TEST.,285,"BACKGROUND Baseline visual acuity (VA) loss from static to dynamic head conditions assessed using the Dynamic Visual Acuity Testing (DVAT) have not been established in NCAA football players. DVAT assesses the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) which is measured in Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR). Decreased VA beyond baseline measures may detect VOR impairment and impact treatment protocols and assist in return to play decisions post-concussion. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE To establish normative VA mean scores during a static head posture as well as dynamically during the DVAT with a head speed of 150 deg/s in the pitch (vertical) and yaw (horizontal) planes rotating 20 degrees in each direction. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study, Diagnostic Tests. METHODS Sixty-seven, NCAA Division I College football players (age = 19.68 ± 1.53) completed static VA and DVAT assessment in the pitch and yaw planes during baseline concussion testing at the beginning of the 2014 regular football season. Comparison of VA was evaluated by calculating the difference in players' static and dynamic VA values using the DVAT. RESULTS Static VA for all participants (n=67) was -0.232 ± 0.109 logMAR. Dynamic VA for participants (n=67) was 0.0845 ± 0.159 in pitch and -0.007 ± 0.141 in yaw at 150 deg/sec. Mean losses in VA during pitch and yaw at 150 deg/sec were 0.317 ± 0.140 and 0.227 ± 0.133, respectively. CONCLUSIONS VA diminishes during head movement at 150 degrees/sec. Loss of acuity beyond established normative values from baseline may be indicative of VOR dysfunction, especially secondary to head trauma. The assessment of visual acuity function with head movements of 150 deg/sec can potentially identify concussion and subsequent sequelae. Further research is recommended.

Stereoscopic acuity in ocular pursuit of moving objects - Dynamic steroscopy and movement parallax: Relevance to road safety and occupational medicine,286,"Relatively little parallelism was found to exist between still and moving objects with regard to three-dimensional vision. Hence, additional dynamic vision testing may be necessary. This is true for both dynamic stereoscopy and dynamic parallactoscopy. The binocular rotational prismometer or parallactoscopometer proved to be highly suitable for testing within that context. There are specific situations in transport, occupational, and sports medicines in which stereoacuity should be tested in conjunction with oculomotoricity, taking into due consideration the inseparable physiological links between the two. There are plenty of three-dimensional movements in the human environment and particularly on road traffic, and proper visual perception of movement can be of crucial importance to job performance and to the rate of traffic accidents although systematic studies have not so far been conducted into the stereoscopic pursuit of moving objects. Vision and movement are closely associated with each other. Yet, the movement factor has so far been blotted out, on grounds of practicability, from all investigations on visual power. Still objects were used as optotypes in vision tests, which meant the rejection of job-related and traffic-related analysis. There is no parallelism at all between the vision of still and moving objects. Evidence to that effect has been produced by early studies into monocular dynamic visual acuity (Ludvigh and Miller, 1958; Jaeger and Honegger, 1964). Individuals with good static visual acuity do not necessarily possess good dynamic visual capacity. This is a decisive aspect, no doubt, when it comes to the appraisal of fitness for certain occupational activities. The same applies to dynamic stereoacuity. Dynamic three-dimensional vision is based on two optosensorial capabilities, binocular stereoscopy and movement parallactoscopy or kinetoparallactoscopy, the latter also being possible in a monocular manner. Dynamic stereopsis can be properly measured by means of the recently developed binocular rotational prismometer (see Section 3.1). Its enormous precision has the greatest effect at short distances (not more than 10 m). When it comes to longer distances, vision was found to be more strongly determined by empirical factors of three-dimensional perception and was found to be decisively determined by dynamic parallactoscopy (seeing moving objects on the basis of movement parallax). The latter can be effectively measured by means of a recently devised parallactoscopometer (see Section 3.2). Dynamic stereoacuity is a highly subtle and remarkably sophisticated sensorial achievement of sensitive reactivity. It is based on stereoscopy, binocular fixation, motor and sensory fusion, and the capability of ocular pursuit movement. These basic factors are highly variable, even in normally sighted individuals. Dynamic stereoacuity is characterised by wide variability. However, stereoscopy has its limits, some of them depending on the associative performance of the central nervous system through which two-dimensional images of lateral disparity are transformed to a three-dimensional perception on the retinae of the two eyes. On the basis of movement parallax, i.e. dynamic parallactoscopy, stereopsis has been the phylogenetically earlier and, consequently, more stable visual capacity by which to perceive a three-dimensional situation. Its sensorial accuracy has proved to be very much below that of dynamic stereoscopy in response to slow velocities. But it has been found to assume an absolutely predominant position in response to moderate and high velocities. It is largely based on the capability of fixation in the course of ocular pursuit movement and, if one eye is visually reduced, on the monocular visual acuity or visual acuity of the better eye. These two components of three-dimensional vision and their sensorial capabilities, are not just of interest from the ophthalmological and sensophysiological points of view. They are certainly of particular relevance to occupational and transport medicine. The visual demands made by quite a number of activities and occupations have grown considerably in relation to technological progress (Merte, 1978), and the need is growing for the formulation of specific criteria of occupational fitness, primarily regarding dynamic stereopsis. This particular need had been left unconsidered in almost all national and international programmes of occupational fitness rating, especially in terms of performance-related and methodological rules or regulations (Broschmann, 1981). Stereoacuity for the perception of moving objects should become part of eye testing for quite a number of activities. Any reduction of dynamic stereoacuity may lead to inadequate visual information and may, thus, assume a straightforward relevance to occupational and transport medicine. Individuals who fail to achieve normal performance in three-dimensional orientation are, in a way, handicapped from the very outset, since, in certain situations, they may be unable to do their jobs according to safety regulations or machine specifications. Motorcar driving ranks high among the practice-related aspects of dynamic stereoacuity. Stereoscopically sighted individuals who suddenly become monocular, may lose a great deal of security in road traffic, e.g., in slow convoy driving, pulling into parking gaps, reversing, assessment of short distances, driving on lanes narrowed by parked vehicles, turning into gateways, or overtaking (Aulhorn, 1976). True, there is something like age-dependent gradual adjustment to monocularity (Heydenreich and Wittwer, 1981), which, however, is no substitute for the loss of stereoscopic vision. On the other hand, persons who have turned monocular are at little or no disadvantage at all in moving traffic. Good stereoscopic vision of road traffic is essential within a range of up to 20 m (Broschmann, 1981; Hartmann and Stocker, 1983). Piper (1969) found stereoscopy to be highly important up to 50 m, Heinsius (1964) even up to 90m. Yet, stereoscopic impressions will become unevaluable for practical purposes, if visual targets are located at long distances from the observer. Three-dimensional perception of moving processes in road traffic travelling at high speeds is ensured by movement parallax. It is an advantage in road traffic that the most important objects of observation, other vehicles, are also moving, which provides for the summation of several three-dimensional impressions. In road traffic, stereoscopic vision is simply a complementary, though not unimportant sensorial security (Dubois-Poulsen, 1969; Schumann, 1959; Broschmann, 1977, 1981). Finally, inadequate dynamic stereoscopy is likely to have consequences in terms of driving economy due to less calm and more nervous driving, resulting in too frequent deceleration or acceleration. A train driver, on the other hand, would only have to concentrate on objects straight ahead, so that, to him, dynamic stereoacuity plays an absolutely subordinate role. Again, this does not apply to train drivers involved in shunting (Vesper, 1965). Stereoscopic vision is not absolutely imperative for aircraft pilots. They have to deal exclusively with fast movement and long distances for which kinetoparallactic vision was found to be more important than stereoscopy (Epstein and Tredici, 1973). Accordingly, no insufficiencies were displayed by professional or amateur pilots who had been blindfolded on one eye. Hence, stereoscopy may be rated as some kind of 'luxurious' asset to flyers (Aichmair, 1983; Grosslight, Fletscher, Masterton and Hagen, 1978). How-ever, Mayer and Lane (1973) found that the number of monocular pilots involved in near or actual accidents had been higher than that of pilots with intact stereoscopy. Sport and glider pilots, parachutists, and helicopter pilots, on the other hand, were found to depend strongly on the accurate assessment of moving objects and, thus, on dynamic stereoscopy (Honegger, 1966), a very particular requirement, when it comes to pinpoint landing. Visual senses and oculomotoricity would be overtaxed in all respects, when it comes to sonic or supersonic speed. High cruising speeds would not leave sufficient time for a full processing by visual senses. A flight distance (blind path) of 300 to 500 m was found to lie between retinal irritation and reaction in sonic speed travel, with accommodation, ocular movement, binocular fusion, and fixation being uncounted for. Dynamic stereoacuity plays an important role in several sport disciplines (Romhild, 1983; Trachtmann, 1973). There is an unambiguous need for prompt and accurate three-dimensional localisation in ball games, long and high jump, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, and gliding. Demands for accuracy are continuously arising in top competitive sports, and it would, therefore, be certainly useful to introduce dynamic stereoacuity testing for the selection of athletes in some sports. It should be done at sport centres, prior to specific practice of coaching programmes. Good dynamic stereoacuity will also facilitate grasping, since the human hand movement must be visually controlled (Noll, 1973). The view has been rapidly gaining ground that classical methods of ophthalmology are no longer sufficient for the adequate assessment of sophisticated performances of the visual process (Schober, 1972, 1976) and that examination methods would be needed by which several activities of the central nervous system could be tested and verified in combination (Backman, 1972). The need for testing of dynamic stereoacuity, i.e. dynamic stereoscopy and dynamic parallactoscopy, is, basically, supported by all the reasons given by examiners of monocular dynamic visual acuity and taken by them as the point of departure for their own investigations. The most important of these reasons relates to the existence of only loose correlations between static and dynamic visual activities (Weissmann and Freeburn, 1965). Critical appraisal of the methods used for testing the visual sense in examinations relating to occupational and transport medicine has been correctly demanded by Schober (1972) as well as by Comberg (1953) and Otto and Hollmuller (1969), with the view to obtaining close-to-reality data. According to them, the sensorial system should be left as far as possible in its inseparable physiological interconnection with concomitant oculomotor activities. Hering pointed out, as early as 1879, that vision by the static eye would actually be an unnatural condition which we should require from our visual organ only for the purpose of medical examination. Dynamic vision testing would certainly enable a better assessment of vision (Methling and Wernicke, 1969; Sollner, 1961). There are very few occupational activities in which excellent three-dimensional vision only is necessary for the observation of static objects. The great number of research papers on dynamic visual acuity is likely to support the assumption that dynamic stereoacuity will be included, in the not too remote future, in ophthalmological examination practice for certain trades and professions where high-quality three-dimensional vision of moving objects is essential, as well as for a more thorough elucidation of the failures that ought to be clearly stated in expert opinions. It has certainly not been accidental that earliest systematic investigations of dynamic visual acuity were not conducted for sensophysiological or clinical interests, but were undertaken by Ludvigh (1949) and Ludvigh and Miller (1958) for the practice-related requirements on naval aviator cadets. The binocular rotational prismometer, as well as the parallactoscopometer, together with their triple-bar and quadruple-bar tests, can be easily designed and composed. Hence, there would be only a few obstacles to incorporating dynamic stereoacuity into fitness verification programmes for certain activities, particularly as tests of that kind would have to be made at only a few centres of occupational and sports medicine. The statement made by Honegger, Schafer, and Jaeger (1969) with regard to visual acuity in the context of moving objects, would equally apply to the analysis of dynamic stereoacuity regarding both the sensophysiological fundamentals and the consequences for occupational medicine: 'Growing interest is being devoted at present to visual acuity for moving objects. There can be no doubt that such functional examination of visual acuity will greatly add to our knowledge on eye performance.' This would be in keeping with the demand made as recently as 1984 by a newly established WHO Working Party (Regional Bureau for Europe) dealing with the problems of traffic accidents caused by medical factors, as well as with gaps in our knowledge in that context.

Visuelle leistungen unter dem aspekt alter,287,"Objective of the study: 20-50 % of older persons have a reduced eyesight, the are not aware of, but that might in most cases be correctable. The pure visual acuity does not show the eyesight in daily life. Next to the glare sensitivity are the contrast sensitivity (often referred to as the ""gold standard"") and the dynamic vision test required for a complete eye examination. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of age on the static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and afferent dynamic vision (based on motion contrast). Methods and subjects: 68 test persons took part voluntarily in the study in the age range of 19.8-64.3 years. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (KE) were determined with the VCTS-board of the VISTECH-company. The afferent dynamic vision was grasped by means of Dusseldorf test for dynamic seeing (DTDS) by Wist. Results: All of the different age groups showed a median visual acuity of 1.0. They were comparable concerning static visual acuity and KE with each other. The age groups differed significantly concerning the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). The age group with the test persons between 20 and 25 years achieved better results compared to the group 46 to 65 years: 94.6 ± 9.7 % vs. 79.2 ± 19.0 % (p = 0.002) of right answers in the DTDS. The age correlated negative with the afferent dynamic vision (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A negative influence of the age on the static visual acuity and the KE was not confirmed. It became clear that with increasing age the afferent dynamic vision decreased. The test persons between 46 and 65 years achieved in the DTDS on average only 79 % of afferent dynamic vision. The older the test persons were, the worse was their afferent dynamic vision.",,,,,,,,
Veränderungen des dynamischen sehens und der kontrastempfindlichkeit durch chronische alkoholabhängigkeit,288,"Background: From sensual physiological perspective, the dynamic visual acuity is characteristic of the magnocellular visual subsystem of the apparatus. The static vision is realized by the parvocellular subsystem, so that dynamic and static visual acuities to be regarded as independent qualities. According to the Federal Ministry of Health (2009) are approximately 1.3 million people in Germany as a declared alcohol. The aim of our study was to examine the dynamic vision to the influence quantity chronic alcohol dependence. Method: It was attended by 106 participants in the investigation. 35 test persons were dependent on alcohol and 71 test persons belonged to the control group. The study design consisted of the collection of sociodemographic data, the medical history and status of ophthalmologic examinations. The dynamic vision was seeing through Düsseldorf for Dynamic Test of Wist (Wist et al. 1998) determined. Results: The alcohol-dependent subjects achieved significantly worse scores in the determination of visual acuity. When considering the dynamic visual performance of subjects with alcohol dependence, this proved to both eyes decreased by 11%. In addition, both eyes were KE-reduced values in different spatial frequencies. Conclusions: Poor dynamic visual performance of subjects with alcohol dependence may be associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Further studies on the reversibility of the effects found are required. © ecomed Medizin, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH.",,,,,,,,
Crowd behaviours analysis in dynamic visual scenes of complex environment,289,"The paper investigates a novel and effective approach for real-time analysis of crowd congestion (density) in a physical space monitored by surveillance cameras. A region of interest (ROI) is specified in the space and partition of the ROI into an irregular array of sub-regions (blobs) automatically carried out, to each of which a congestion contributor is computed. The method then exploits the short-term responsive background (STRB) model for blob-based dynamic congestion detection, and uses the long-term stationary background (LTSB) model for blob-based 'zero-motion' (static congestion) detection. A global feature analysis is adopted for scene scatters characterisation; and finally, the combination of the local and global analysis gives the accurate scene congestion rating. Besides, this scheme is adapted to perform the task of moving object presence detection with success. Extensive tests and field trials validate both the accuracy and robustness of the approach. © 2008 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711678
The effect of optotype contrast and chromaticity on dynamic visual acuity,290,"Purpose: Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) plays an important role in tasks such as driving and sports, and can be influenced by features such as contrast and chromaticity. Research has shown that low contrast results in worse static and dynamic VA; however the impact of chromaticity on static and dynamic VA is unclear. This study examines the impact of contrast and chromaticity on DVA. Methods: 42 participants were assigned to one of two study blocks: 1) Contrast (n=21), 2) Chromatic (n=21). Each block consisted of 2 study visits that were a minimum of 2 weeks apart. At each visit, DVA was measured using moV& (V&MP Vision Suite). Contrast block testing measured DVA at 44% and 10% contrast. Chromatic block testing measured DVA using a red target/white background and a white target/blue background. Within each block, tests were run with a constant target size (+0.8, +0.6, or +0.4 logMAR above static VA threshold) and increasing target speed, as well as with a constant target speed (1, 3, 6, 9, or 12m/s) with decreasing target size. Horizontal, vertical, oblique, and random walk motion trajectories were used. DVA and speed thresholds were compared between contrast levels and colour combinations. Results: As target contrast decreased from 44% to 10%, DVA and speed threshold significantly worsened for all trajectories measured (p < 0.05). Overall, there was a significant effect of chromaticity on DVA with the white/blue combination yielding better DVA compared to red/white (mean logMAR DVA: red/white = 0.37 ± 0.19; white/blue = 0.33 ± 0.18, p < 0.05). However, chromaticity did not have a significant effect on speed threshold (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): DVA is worse at lower contrast and with red letters on a white background. Speed thresholds are also worse at low contrast, but chromaticity does not appear to impact speed thresholds on this task. Further investigation into additional chromaticity combinations is needed to better understand this phenomenon.",,,,,,,,
Functional assessment of patients with vertigo and dizziness in occupational medicine,291,"BACKGROUND: Balance assessment relies on symptoms, clinical examination and functional assessment and their verification in objective tests. Our study was aimed at calculating the assessment compatibility between questionnaires, functional scales and objective vestibular and balance examinations., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 131 patients (including 101 women; mean age: 59+/-14 years) of the audiology outpatient clinic was examined. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, phobic vertigo and central dizziness were the most common diseases observed in the study group. Patients' symptoms were tested using the questionnaire on Cawthworne-Cooksey exercises (CC), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Duke Anxiety-Depression Scale. Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Tinetti test, Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) were used for the functional balance assessment. Objective evaluation included: videonystagmography caloric test and static posturography., RESULTS: The study results revealed statistically significant but moderate compatibility between functional tests BBS, DGI, TUG, DVA and caloric results (Kendall's W = 0.29) and higher for posturography (W = 0.33). The agreement between questionnaires and objective tests were very low (W = 0.08-0.11).The positive predictive values of BBS were 42% for caloric and 62% for posturography tests, of DGI - 46% and 57%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results of functional tests (BBS, DGI, TUG, DVA) revealed statistically significant correlations with objective balance tests but low predictive values did not allow to use these tests in vestibular damage screening. Only half of the patients with functional disturbances revealed abnormal caloric or posturography tests. The qualification to work based on objective tests ignore functional state of the worker, which may influence the ability to work.

Dynamic Saliency Model Inspired by Middle Temporal Visual Area: A Spatio-Temporal Perspective,292,"With the advancement in technology, digital visual data is also increasing day by day. And there is a great need to develop systems that can understand it. For computers, this is a daunting task to do but our brain efficiently and apparently effortlessly doing this task very well. This paper aims to devise a dynamic saliency model inspired by the human visual system. Most models are based on low-level image features and focus on static and dynamic images. And those models do not perform well in accordance with the human gaze movement for dynamic scenes. We here demonstrate that a combined model of bio-inspired spatio-temporal features, high-level and low-level features outperform listed models in predicting human fixation on dynamic visual input. Our comparison with other models is based on eye-movement recordings of human participants observing dynamic natural scenes.",,,,,,,,10.1109/DICTA.2018.8615806
Preoperative medication with oral morphine sulphate and postoperative pain,293,"Background. The administration of an analgesic drug prior to nociceptive surgical stimulus could result in a better postoperative pain management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral morphine sulphate on postoperative pain relief. Methods. Sixty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to premedication with 0.5 mg/kg oral morphine sulphate (oral morphine group) or 0.05 mg/kg oral midazolam (active placebo group). Primary outcome was efficacy of morphine premedication on opioid administration of Intra Venous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) doses, at 4, 24, and 48 hours after completion of surgery and reducing static and dynamic visual analogue scale (sVAS and dVAS) scores. Secondary outcome was the time needed for the recovery of canalization of the gastro-intestinal tract. It was also evaluated fentanyl intraoperative consumption. Statistical analysis was performed by linear regression and student t test. Values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Results. The two groups were comparable with respect to patient characteristics. At 24 and 48 hours post surgery, administered IVPCA doses were reduced in the oral morphine group compared to the active placebo group (P<0.05). Values of sVAS and dVAS were significantly lower in the oral morphine group compared to the active placebo group at all assessment times (P<0.05). Fentanyl consumption was similar in both groups. Needs of a ketorolac rescue dose was greater in the ap versus the om group (21 patients in the ap vs 9 patients in the om group, P<0.001). Mean gastrointestinal canalization did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusions. In major abdominal surgery, premedication with oral morphine sulphate produces better postoperative pain control and has an opioid-sparing effect without delaying gastrointestinal canalization time.",,,,,,,,
"Expectancy, not memory determines identical search rates in static and dynamic displays.",294,"Search rates are often used as a measure of search efficiency. Horowitz & Wolfe employed this measure to compare static and dynamic visual search (Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998). Based on identical search rates, they argued that visual search operates without memory. Subsequently and in contrast a number of other authors have agued that visual search relies upon iconic memory ( Bäcker & Peral, 1999; Peterson, Kramer, Wang, Irwin, & McCarley, 2001; Scheier, Khurana, Itti, & Koch, 1999). In a reanalysis of Horowitz and Wolfe¿s data, Kornbrot found contrary results (Kornbrot, 2004). Search rates only indicate search efficiency and the implications of this may be limited. In this commentary we propose a probability model and point out that factors such as target probability and subjective expectancy may bring about similar results.",,,,,,,,
Oscillopsia and pseudonystagmus in kidney transplant patients,295,"PURPOSE: Modern immunosuppressants have improved the success of kidney transplantation for renal failure patients. They also may induce neurotoxic effects including tremor. We report two cases of pseudonystagmus and oscillopsia in transplant patients caused by immunosuppressant-induced head tremor and gentamicin-induced vestibulotoxicity. METHODS: Case reports. Head tremor, static visual acuity, and dynamic visual acuity were measured. Vestibular function was evaluated with ice water calorics. RESULTS: Both patients had significant head tremor and pseudonystagmus. Head stabilization improved static visual acuity. Dynamic visual acuity revealed a 4-line and 10-line loss of visual acuity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings of pseudonystagmus and oscillopsia are likely to become more prevalent as more renal failure patients receive transplants. Improvement may be seen with reduction of immunosuppressant, reduction of stimulant intake, use of medications to reduce head tremor, and vestibular rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,10.1016/S0002-9394(99)00249-4
A dynamic visual recognition test for paced inspection tasks,296,"In many manufacturing organizations, employees are required visually to inspect parts that are moving along a conveyor. Applicants for these inspection tasks are often selected as the result of their performance on static visual acuity tests and rarely on the basis of the recently proposed dynamic acuity tests. However, conventional static and dynamic acuity tests have often proven unsuccessful in predicting operator performance on conveyor-paced inspection tasks because of the physical, psychological, and physiological differences between visual tests and the operating tasks.

Performance‐Based Measurements Among Elderly Drivers and Nondrivers,297,"Although driving is an important ability for maintaining independence in the later years, clinical factors that determine driving status are unknown. Aged male veterans (mean age, 70 years) were recruited from an outpatient clinic (N = 143), including 77 frequent drivers, 41 infrequent drivers, and 25 who drove rarely or not at all. There were 116 (84%) who completed a comprehensive performance‐based assessment. There were no significant differences between the three groups in age, formal cognitive testing, or prevalence of stroke history. However, there were significant differences in grip strength, reaction time, static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, and peripheral vision. Using stepwise ordinal logistic regression, dynamic visual acuity, nondominant hand grip strength, and total horizontal peripheral visual field were significantly associated with driving frequency (P < .05), and together explained approximately 45% of the variance. Subtle motor and visual deficits that can be detected by a performance‐based assessment may play an important role in determining driving frequency in the elderly. 1988 The American Geriatrics Society",,,,,,,,10.1111/j.1532-5415.1988.tb04265.x
"Comparison of dynamic visual acuity, with vernier and resolution targets, as a function of contrast and velocity",298,"Purpose. Many of the parameters that affect Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) for resolution targets have been carefully investigated (e.g., Zhan, et al, ARVO 1994). A number of experimental parameters affect Static Visual Acuity (SVA) for resolution targets differently from vernier targets (Levi; Klein; others). We present an initial study of DVA with vernier targets. Methods. We measured DVA at target horizontal velocities of 60, 90, and 120 deg/sec, and SVA at 0 deg/sec. Resolution targets were vertical square-wave gratings of varying spatial frequency. Vernier targets were vertical square-wave gratings of fixed spatial frequency with variable horizontal offsets between the top and bottom halves of the gratings, and no separation between the halves. Target exposure time was 350 ms; the method of 2AFC was used; background luminance was 0.29 cd/m2 (low mesopic); contrast varied from 0.99 to 0.35. Results. For SVA, as in earlier studies, LogMAR for the resolution targets at high contrast was significantly greater than LogMAO (Minimum Angle of Offset) for the vernier targets, and contrast reduction raised both measurements similarly. Increasing velocity increased both LogMAR and LogMAO, but the slope of the function of LogMAO vs velocity was steeper than that for LogMAR, and resolution and vernier acuities converged towards the same magnitude at 120 deg/sec. Conclusions. With increasing velocity, the peripheral retina is used to discriminate DVA targets. Our results on the convergence of the two measures can be accounted for by the fact that vernier acuity deteriorates more rapidly with increasing eccentricity than does resolution acuity (Westheimer, VR, 1982); no additional consideration of the effects of retinal slip are necessarily required (e.g., Carney, et al., VR, 1995).",,,,,,,,
Lateral orientation and stabilization of human stance: static versus dynamic visual cues,299,"The differential contributions of static versus dynamic visual cues to postural control were studied in human subjects. Lateral body oscillations were measured with accelerometers located at head, hips and ankle levels, while subjects righted their balance under various mechanical conditions: i) on either a soft (foam rubber) support or a hard one, and ii) in either the classical or the sharpened Romberg stance. The visual pattern (horizontal or vertical rectangular grating) was illuminated with either a stroboscopic bulb or a normal one, and control measurements were also taken in darkness for each mechanical condition. Acceleration signals were processed into their frequency power spectra, the mean area and shape of which were taken to characterize the postural skills involved and the effects of either the visual suppressions or the mechanical destabilizations. Although dynamic visual cues have already been found to play a major role in the control of lateral body sway (Amblard and Crémieux 1976), we demonstrate here that static visual cues, the only ones available under stroboscopic illumination, also make a clear though minor contribution. Hence we suggest the existence of two modes of visual control of lateral balance in man, which are well separated in terms of the frequency range of body sway: the first mechanism, which operates below 2 Hz and is strobe-resistant, seems to control the orientation of the upper part of the body; the second mechanism, which operates above 4 Hz, centers on about 7 Hz and is strobe-vulnerable, seems to immobilize the body working upwards from the feet. Thus static visual cues may slowly control re-orientation or displacement, whereas dynamic visual cues may contribute to fast stabilization of the body. In between the frequency ranges at which these two visuomotor mechanisms come into play, at about 3 Hz, there is what we call a ""blind frequency"", a visually neutral sway frequency which may arise from the incompatibility of visual reorientation with visual stabilization, and where vision appears unable to reduce postural sway to any marked extent. Transmission of the destabilization produced by suppression of visual cues or by mechanical methods from one anatomical level to another is also briefly discussed in terms of bio-mechanical constraints, and the correlations between various pairs of levels are considered. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF00235617
Interference in visual working memory,300,"This paper uses the theoretical distinction that has recently developed between the passive visual store and the active spatial rehearsal mechanism of the visuo-spatial component of working memory (VSSP). It examines the circumstances under which visual fields gain functional access to the passive visual store and seeks to cast light on the circumstances under which irrelevant visual fields interfere with concurrent visual processing. Experiment 1 contrasts a dynamic visual noise field with a static noise field and shows that the static field, in contrast to the dynamic noise field, causes no interference when presented concurrently with a visual task. Experiment 2 investigates the reason for this contrast and concludes that the static field is susceptible to decay and so fails to cause interference. Experiment 3 investigates further the circumstances under which dynamic visual noise causes interference and shows that manipulation of the number of changes within the noise field is also of importance in causing interference. The results allow further consideration of the characteristics of the VSSP.",,,,,,,,10.1080/713755873
Short-term memory recall of visual patterns under static and dynamic visual noise,301,"Dynamic visual noise (DVN) has been shown to interfere with short-term memory (STM) based on visual imagery, but DVN interference has been difficult to observe in STM tasks that are based on visual stimuli. The present study investigated the effects of DVN and static visual noise (SVN) in a matrix pattern recall task. The participants were required to replicate a matrix pattern that was presented for 400 ms, followed by a retention interval of 9 s that consisted of DVN, SVN, or a blank screen. The results showed that both DVN and SVN impaired the recall of matrix patterns compared with the blank screen condition, suggesting that irrelevant sensory input indeed impairs information that is held in visuospatial working memory. These results support the hypothesis of a passive visual storage system (i.e., visual buffer) that is susceptible to sensory input. The results of the visual imagery and recognition tasks can be extended to cases of visual recall. The results are discussed from the perspective of methodological differences concerning experimental procedures and theoretical models of visuospatial working memory.",,,,,,,,10.1037/pne0000039
"Gaze stabilization test: Reliability, response stability, performance of healthy subjects and patients with concussion",302,"Gaze stabilization test (GST) and dynamic visual acuity (DVA) test are functional measures of the vestibulo-ocular reflex which helps to maintain clear vision during head movement. The purposes of this dissertation were threefold; first the reliability of GST and DVA test were examined. Twenty-nine patients with vestibular disease were tested repeatedly using the computerized InVision(TM) test. Results showed that the reliability of the tests were fair to poor with the DVA reliability better than the GST and the within-session reliability better than between-session reliability.                 In the second Aim, the goal was to obtain better understanding of the effect of optotype (the letter E) parameters on subjects' performance. The performance of twenty-one healthy young subjects on the GST was examined over a range of optotype sizes and presentation times. Results showed that the optotype parameters had a significant effect on subjects' performance with only one combination in which most healthy subjects were able to accomplish fast head velocities while being able to identify the optotype correctly. An optotype that is 0.30 logMAR above a subject's static vision and presented for 40 msec longer than minimum presentation time is recommended for future testing.                 Lastly, the preferred combination from the second Aim was used to examine the performance of twenty-two young patients following concussion and compare it with the healthy subjects from Aim 2. Correlations between patients' performance on the GST and their scores on tests commonly used following concussion were also examined. Results showed no significant differences between the performance of patients and that of healthy subjects on the GST. Also, there were no significant correlations between the GST and other measures used following concussion.                 Results show that the protocol used for the GST needed refinement. Special consideration is to be given to the optotype parameters used since these were found to significantly influence performance. The lack of significant differences between patients following concussion and healthy subjects could be due to the inclusion of all patients following concussion without objective evidence of vestibular involvement. Future studies should use specific optotype parameters and include patients following concussion with evidence of vestibular dysfunction.",,,,,,,,
Sensitivity to dynamic auditory and visual stimuli predicts nonword reading ability in both dyslexic and normal readers,303,"Background: Developmental dyslexia is a specific disorder of reading and spelling that affects 3-9% of school-age children and adults. Contrary to the view that it results solely from deficits in processes specific to linguistic analysis, current research has shown that deficits in more basic auditory or visual skills may contribute to the reading difficulties of dyslexic individuals. These might also have a crucial role in the development of normal reading skills. Evidence for visual deficits in dyslexia is usually found only with dynamic and not static stimuli, implicating the magnocellular pathway or dorsal visual stream as the cellular locus responsible. Studies of such a dissociation between the processing of dynamic and static auditory stimuli have not been reported previously. Results: We show that dyslexic individuals are less sensitive both to particular rates of auditory frequency modulation (2 Hz and 40 Hz but not 240 Hz) and to dynamic visual-motion stimuli. There were high correlations, for both dyslexic and normal readers, between their sensitivity to the dynamic auditory and visual stimuli. Nonword reading, a measure of phonological awareness believed crucial to reading development, was also found to be related to these sensory measures. Conclusions: These results further implicate neuronal mechanisms that are specialised for detecting stimulus timing and change as being dysfunctional in many dyslexic individuals. The dissociation observed in the performance of dyslexic individuals on different auditory tasks suggests a sub-modality division similar to that already described in the visual system. These dynamic tests may provide a non-linguistic means of identifying children at risk of reading failure.",,,,,,,,10.1016/S0960-9822(98)70320-3

Head stabilization shows visual and inertial dependence during passive stimulation: Implications for virtual rehabilitation,305,"Sensorimotor coordination relies on the fine calibration and integration of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory input. Using virtual environments (VE) allows for the dissociation of visual and inertial inputs to manipulate human behavioral outputs. Our goal was to employ VE technology in a novel manner to investigate how head stabilization is affected by spatiotemporal properties of dynamic visual input when combined with passive motion on a linear sled. Healthy adults (n = 12) wore a head-mounted display during naso-occipital sinusoidal horizontal whole body translations while seated. Subjects were secured in a seat with a five-point harness, with the head free to move. Frequency and amplitude of sinusoidal input (i.e., inertial conditions) were set to create overlapping conditions of maximum acceleration (amax) or velocity (v max). Four inertial conditions were combined with four visual conditions (VIS). VIS were created so that direction of optic flow either matched direction of passive motion or did not. The effect of near and far fixation distance within the VE was also tested. Head kinematics were collected with a three-axis gyro. Head stability showed a complex interaction dependent on changes in weighting of visual and inertial inputs that changed with the sled driving frequency. Inertial condition affected amplitude (p < 0.0000) and phase (p < 0.0000) of head pitch angular velocity. In the absence of visual input, head pitch velocity amplitude increased (p < 0.01). An interaction effect between inertial and VIS conditions on head yaw occurred in SW (p < 0.05). There was also a significant interaction of depth of field and inertial condition on amplitude (p < 0.001) and phase ( p < 0.05 ) of head yaw velocity in SW, especially during high vmax conditions. We conclude visual flow can organize lateral cervical responses despite being discordant with inertial input. When using VE for rehabilitation, possible unintended, involuntary or reflexive motor responses that may not be present in traditional training environments should be taken into consideration. © 2001-2011 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2237040
Acoustic characteristics of English fricatives Spectral Properties of Fricative Consonants Acoustic characteristics of English fricatives,306,"This study constitutes a large-scale comparative analysis of acoustic cues for classification of place of articulation in fricatives. To date, no single metric has been found to classify fricative place of articulation with a high degree of accuracy. This study presents spectral, amplitudinal, and temporal measurements that involve both static properties spectral peak location, spectral moments, noise duration, normalized amplitude, and F2 onset frequency and dynamic properties relative amplitude and locus equations. While all cues except locus equations consistently serve to distinguish sibilant from nonsibilant fricatives, the present results indicate that spectral peak location, spectral moments, and both normalized and relative amplitude serve to distinguish all four places of fricative articulation. These findings suggest that these static and dynamic acoustic properties can provide robust and unique information about all four places of articulation, despite variation in speaker, vowel context, and voicing.",,,,,,,,10.1121/1.1288413
Perception of static and dynamic acoustic cues to place of articulation in initial stop consonants,307,"Two recent accounts of the acoustic cues which specify place of articulation in syllable-initial stop consonants claim that they are located in the initial portions of the C V waveform and are context-free. Stevens and Blumstein [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 64, 1358–1368 (1978)] have described the perceptually relevant spectral properties of these cues as static, while Kewley-Port [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 73, 322-335 (1983)] describes these cues as dynamic. Three perceptual experiments were conducted to test predictions derived from these accounts. Experiment 1 confirmed that acoustic cues for place of articulation are located in the initial 20–40 ms of natural stop-vowel syllables. Next, short synthetic CV's modeled after natural syllables were generated using either a digital, parallel-resonance synthesizer in experiment 2 or linear prediction synthesis in experiment 3. One set of synthetic stimuli preserved the static spectral properties proposed by Stevens and Blumstein. Another set of synthetic stimuli preserved the dynamic properties suggested by Kewley-Port. Listeners in both experiments identified place of articulation significantly better from stimuli which preserved dynamic acoustic properties than from those based on static onset spectra. Evidently, the dynamic structure of the initial stop-vowel articulatory gesture can be preserved in context-free acoustic cues which listeners use to identify place of articulation. © 1983, Acoustical Society of America.

NPV Sensitivity Analysis: A Dynamic Excel Approach,308,"Financial analysts generally create static formulas for the computation of NPV.  When they do so, however, it is not readily apparent how sensitive the value of NPV is to changes in multiple interdependent and interrelated variables. It is the aim of this paper to analyze this variability by employing a dynamic, visually graphic presentation using Excel.  Our approach illustrates how these variables, when increased or decreased to reflect the potential range of values in a business case, change the value of NPV, and hence affect the decision about whether to proceed with the project or to reject it. Furthermore, since sales revenue is one of the least certain elements in the business case, the presentation includes a probability estimate of whether NPV will be positive or negative, assuming that sales revenue is normally distributed with a known mean and standard deviation. The business case we have chosen for illustrative purposes is a global energy project. Nevertheless, financial analysts in any industry should be able to apply our dynamic spreadsheet approach to their projects as well.",,,,,,,,10.19030/ajbe.v10i3.9983
"Soundscape characterization in a dynamic acoustic environment: Grand Passage, Nova Scotia, a planned in-stream tidal energy site",309,"The marine environment in the Bay of Fundy hosts a dynamic and diverse soundscape that is a fundamental component of the local ecosystem. The emergence of new human marine activities and infrastructure, such as tidal turbine installations, introduces new sound sources that change or disrupt the existing acoustic environment, but the full extent of these changes is not well understood and is not predictable. To better evaluate the effects of future tidal energy development on the local soundscape in Grand Passage, Nova Scotia, a thorough understanding of the pre-development characteristics must be established. The present research seeks to identify existing anthropophony, biophony, and geophony, and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms contributing to geophonic variability. Passive acoustic measurements have been conducted using long-term moored omnidirectional hydrophones, a moored 5-channel array, and drifting hydrophone arrays, enabling identification of dominant signals and source direction, estimation of pseudonoise masking effects due to turbulent flow, and analysis of diurnal, daily, seasonal, and annual variability as well as spatial variability within the study area. This paper provides an overview of the dominant sound sources and discusses the effects of environmental forcing on soundscape characteristics.",,,,,,,,10.1121/2.0000246
Experimental analysis of acoustic field control-based robot navigation,310,"This paper proposes novel robot navigation methods that utilize strong interaction between a designed field and a robot controller. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the importance of interactions between different subject types (e.g., human-robot interaction, robot-environment interaction) instead of just that between a robot controller and an isolated subject. This study explores the robot-field interaction design to realize autonomous robot navigation, and verifies the proposed methods experimentally. We prepare acoustic navigation trails from the start to the goal; one is generated from multiple sounds with identical frequencies, while the other is generated from multiple sounds with different frequencies. For each field controller, both the dynamic acoustic trail and the static acoustic trail, two types of static robot controllers are designed based only on the present sensor data, namely, gradient-following controller and sound-habituation controller. The former is a microphone-array based controller for robots equipped with multiple microphones, while the latter is designed for robots with a single microphone. Throughout the real-world demonstration, we show the validity of our proposed methods.",,,,,,,,10.20965/jrm.2019.p0110
Dynamic sound localization in cats,311,Sound localization in cats and humans relies on head-centered acoustic cues. Studies have shown that humans are able to localize sounds during rapid head movements that are directed toward the target or other objects of interest. We studied whether cats are able to utilize similar dynamic acoustic cues to localize acoustic targets delivered during rapid eye-head gaze shifts. We trained cats with visual-auditory two-step tasks in which we presented a brief sound burst during saccadic eye-head gaze shifts toward a prior visual target. No consistent or significant differences in accuracy or precision were found between this dynamic task (2-step saccade) and the comparable static task (single saccade when the head is stable) in either horizontal or vertical direction. Cats appear to be able to process dynamic auditory cues and execute complex motor adjustments to accurately localize auditory targets during rapid eyehead gaze shifts.,,,,,,,,10.1152/jn.00105.2015
Dynamic stimulation evokes spatially focused receptive fields in bat auditory cortex,312,"Bats can orient and hunt for prey in complete darkness using echolocation. Due to the pulse-like character of call emission they receive a stroboscopic view of their environment. During target approach, bats adjust their emitted echolocation calls to the specific requirements of the dynamically changing environmental and behavioral context. In addition to changes of the spectro-temporal call features, the spatial focusing of the beam of the sonar emissions onto the target is a conspicuous feature during target tracking. The neural processes underlying the complex sensory-motor interactions during target tracking are not well understood. In this study, we used a two-tone-pulse paradigm with 81 combinations of inter-aural intensity differences and six inter-pulse intervals in a passive hearing task to tackle the question of how transient changes in the azimuthal position of successive sounds are encoded by neurons in the auditory cortex of the bat Phyllostomus discolor. In a population of cortical neurons (11%, 24 of 217), spatial receptive fields were focused to a small region of frontal azimuthal positions during dynamic stimulation with tone-pulse pairs at short inter-pulse intervals. The response of these neurons might be important for the behaviorally observed locking of the sonar beam onto a selected target during the later stages of target tracking. Most interestingly, the majority of these neurons (88%, 21 of 24) were located in the posterior dorsal part of the auditory cortex. This cortical subfield might thus be specifically involved in the analysis of dynamic acoustic scenes. © The Authors (2010).

Effects of directional hearing aid settings on different laboratory measures of spatial awareness perception,313,"Hearing loss can negatively influence the spatial hearing abilities of hearing-impaired listeners, not only in static but also in dynamic auditory environments. Therefore, ways of addressing these deficits with advanced hearing aid algorithms need to be investigated. In a previous study based on virtual acoustics and a computer simulation of different bilateral hearing aid fittings, we investigated auditory source movement detectability in older hearing- impaired (OHI) listeners. We found that two directional processing algorithms could substantially improve the detectability of left-right and near-far source movements in the presence of reverberation and multiple interfering sounds. In the current study, we carried out similar measurements with a loudspeaker-based setup and wearable hearing aids. We fitted a group of 15 OHI listeners with bilateral behind-the-ear devices that were programmed to have three different directional processing settings. Apart from source movement detectability, we assessed two other aspects of spatial awareness perception. Using a street scene with up to five environmental sound sources, the participants had to count the number of presented sources or to indicate the movement direction of a single target signal. The data analyses showed a clear influence of the number of concurrent sound sources and the starting position of the moving target signal on the participants’ performance, but no influence of the different hearing aid settings. Complementary artificial head recordings showed that the acoustic differences between the three hearing aid settings were rather small. Another explanation for the lack of effects of the tested hearing aid settings could be that the simulated street scenario was not sufficiently sensitive. Possible ways of improving the sensitivity of the laboratory measures while maintaining high ecological validity and complexity are discussed.",,,,,,,,10.4081/audiores.2018.215
Passive perceptual learning versus active searching in a novel stimuli vigilance task,314,"A criticism of laboratory vigilance or sustained attention research is the employment of static monotonous tasks with repetitive targets as opposed to the use of dynamic tasks with novel target stimuli. Unfortunately dynamic tasks employing novel stimuli may result in the mixture of two cognitive processes: active sustained attention search and passive perceptual learning. Moreover, the relative engagement of these two processes may depend on individual differences. In the present study, we examined this by having participants perform a dynamic auditory vigilance task with rare novel targets. In addition, some participants performed this task while also performing a secondary motor tracking task, a dual-task scenario. In the dual-task scenario, participants who failed to accurately detect the first target stimuli showed improvements in their tracking performance with time-on-task, suggesting reserves of attention. This improvement in tracking performance was not evident for those who accurately detected the first target stimuli, as their attention was likely actively engaged (searching). In addition, participants in the dual-task scenario who accurately detected the first target stimuli reported high workload and increased post-task tense arousal, results characteristic of participants performing static vigilance tasks. These results indicate the possibility that in a dynamic vigilance task with novel target stimuli participants may diverge in how they approach the task. Some participants will actively monitor the display for targets (search), whereas others will passively learn the target stimuli. Thus, these tasks may pose significant challenges to researchers who wish to examine vigilance in isolation from perceptual learning.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s00221-015-4222-z
Compression and its effect on the speech signal,315,"Compression systems are often used in hearing aids to increase the wearing comfort. A patient has to readjust frequently the gain of a linear hearing aid because of the limited dynamic hearing range and the changing acoustical conditions. A great deal of attention has been given to the static parameters but very little to the dynamic parameters. We present a general method to describe the dynamic behavior of a compression system by comparing modulations at the output with modulations at the input. The use of this method resulted in a single parameter describing the temporal characteristics of a compressor, the cut-off modulation frequency. In this paper its value is compared with known properties of running speech. A limitation of this method is the use of only small modulation depths, and the consequence of this limitation is tested. The use of this method is described for an experimental digital compressor developed by the authors, and the effects of some temporal parameters such as attack and release time are studied. This method shows the rather large effects of some of the parameters on the effectiveness of a compressor on speech. This method is also used to analyze two generally accepted compression systems in hearing aids. The theoretical method is next compared to the effects of compression on the distribution of the amplitude envelope of running speech, and it could be shown that single-channel compression systems do not reduce the distribution width of speech filtered in frequency bands. This finding questions the use of compression systems for fitting the speech banana in the dynamic hearing range of impaired listeners.",,,,,,,,10.1097/00003446-199604000-00008
Two- to Eight-Month-Old Infants' Perception of Dynamic Auditory-Visual Spatial Colocation,316,"From birth, infants detect associations between the locations of static visual objects and sounds they emit, but there is limited evidence regarding their sensitivity to the dynamic equivalent when a sound-emitting object moves. In 4 experiments involving thirty-six 2-month-olds, forty-eight 5-month-olds, and forty-eight 8-month-olds, we investigated infants' ability to process this form of spatial colocation. Whereas there was no evidence of spontaneous sensitivity, all age groups detected a dynamic colocation during habituation and looked longer at test trials in which sound and sight were dislocated. Only 2-month-olds showed clear sensitivity to the dislocation relation, although 8-month-olds did so following additional habituation. These results are discussed relative to the intersensory redundancy hypothesis and work suggesting increasing specificity in processing with age. © 2011 The Authors.

HapticWalker-A Novel Haptic Foot Device,317,"This paper presents a new haptic locomotion interface, which comprises two programmable foot platforms with permanent foot machine contact. It is designed as a scalable and modular system with unit-by-unit extensibility offering up to six plus one degrees of freedom (DOF) per foot. The basic setup comprises three DOF per foot in the sagittal plane. The machine is based on a rigid hybrid parallel-serial robot kinematics structure. It is equipped with electrical direct drive motors , enabling highly dynamic footplate motions. For contact force measurement, six DOF force/torque sensors are mounted under each foot platform. The system was developed for major application in gait rehabilitation, hence great importance was attached to the incorporation of maximum passive and active security measures for machine users and medical operating personnel. The simulator is able to perform walking trajectories with speeds of up to 5 km/h and 120 steps/min. The system is able to simulate not only slow and ""smooth"" trajectories like walking on an even floor, up/down staircases, but also foot motions like walking on rough ground or even stumbling or sliding, which require high system dynamics. The machine is controlled by a self-developed full-featured robot control whose soft and hardware is based on up-to-date industrial standards and interfaces. The robot control software is based on RTLinux and runs on an industrial PC. The real-time motion generator includes a newly developed Fourier-based algorithm for the interpolation of natural cyclic walking trajectories. For the implementation of asynchronous events (e.g., sliding, stumbling), the controller comprises especially developed algorithms for automatic motion override adaptation. Different modes of haptic behavior needed for gait rehabilitation, ranging from full foot support during swing phase to completely passive behavior, are currently under development. Intuitive and safe machine operation by nontechnical personnel such as clinicians and physiotherapists is achieved via a separate Windows-based graphical user interface software comprising different window areas for machine programming and operation, real-time off-line simulation and online data visualization in two and three dimensions has been developed as well. A working prototype of the system has been built and tested successfully, including all soft and hardware components. Although the machine has been designed and built for major application in gait rehabilitation, its range of applicability is not limited to this area. It could be integrated into any setup requiring a highly dynamic haptic foot interface and permanent foot machine contact if needed.",,,,,,,,
The Effect of Binaural Beamforming Technology on Speech Intelligibility in Bimodal Cochlear Implant Recipients,318,"Although the benefit of bimodal listening in cochlear implant users has been agreed on, speech comprehension remains a challenge in acoustically complex real-life environments due to reverberation and disturbing background noises. One way to additionally improve bimodal auditory performance is the use of directional microphones. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a binaural beamformer for bimodal cochlear implant (CI) users. This prospective study measured speech reception thresholds (SRT) in noise in a repeated-measures design that varied in listening modality for static and dynamic listening conditions. A significant improvement in SRT of 4.7 dB was found with the binaural beamformer switched on in the bimodal static listening condition. No significant improvement was found in the dynamic listening condition. We conclude that there is a clear additional advantage of the binaural beamformer in bimodal CI users for predictable/static listening conditions with frontal target speech and spatially separated noise sources.",,,,,,,,10.1159/000487749
Generalized metrics for constant directivity,319,"Metrics are proposed for quantifying the extent to which a transducer's polar radiation (or sensitivity) pattern is invariant with frequency. As there is currently no established measure of this quality (often called ""controlled"" or ""constant directivity""), five metrics, each based on commonly-used criteria for constant directivity, are proposed: (1) a Fourier analysis of sensitivity contour lines (i.e., lines of constant sensitivity over frequency and angle), (2) the average of spectral distortions within a specified angular listening window, (3) the solid angle of the frontal region with distortions below a specified threshold, (4) the standard deviation of the directivity index, and (5) cross-correlations of polar responses. These metrics are computed for 10 loudspeakers that are ranked, from most constant-directive to least, according to each metric. The resulting values and rankings are compared and the suitability of each metric for comparing transducers in different applications is assessed. For critical listening applications in reflective or dynamic listening environments, metric 1 appears most suitable, while for such applications in acoustically-treated and static environments, metrics 2 and 3 may be preferable. Furthermore, for high-amplitude applications (e.g., live sound) in reflective or noisy environments, metrics 4 and 5 appear most suitable.",,,,,,,,10.17743/jaes.2019.0022
FluxMarker: Enhancing tactile graphics with dynamic tactile markers,320,"For people with visual impairments, tactile graphics are an impor-tant means to learn and explore information. However, raised line tactile graphics created with traditional materials such as emboss-ing are static. Whileavailable refreshable displays can dynamically change the content, they are still too expensive for manyusers, and are limited in size. Thesefactors limit wide-spread adoption and the representation of large graphics or data sets. In this paper, we present FluxMaker, an inexpensive scalable system that renders dy-namic information on top of static tactile graphics with movable tactile markers. These dynamic tactile markers can be easily re-configured and used to annotate static raised line tactile graphics, including maps, graphs, and diagrams. We developed a hardware prototype that actuates magnetic tactile markers driven by low-cost and scalable electromagnetic coil arrays, which can befabricated with standard printed circuit boardmanufacturing.Weevaluate our prototype with six participants with visual impairments and found positive results across four application areas: location finding or navigating on tactile maps, data analysis, and physicalization, fea-ture identification for tactile graphics, and drawing support.

Stereohaptics Toolkit for Dynamic Tactile Experiences,321,"We introduce a toolkit for creating, editing, storing, sharing and broadcasting dynamic haptic media through current computing devices.

Electrospun gelatin nanofiber based self-powered bio-e-skin for health care monitoring,322,"Progress on smart self-powered electronic skin (e-skin) presents unique opportunities to detect and discriminate static human physiological signals and dynamic tactile stimuli. Nevertheless, development of piezoelectric materials possessing adequate flexibility, light weight, ease of large-area processing, low cost and environmental safety are attractive but remains a challenging choice for next-generation pressure/force sensors and mechanical energy harvesters. Here, we design a wearable bio-inspired piezoelectric pressure sensor (i.e., bio-e-skin) from structurally stable fish gelatin nanofibers (GNFs) using large area compatible electrospining technology. Owing to superior mechanosensitivity (~0.8 V kPa−1), the bio-e-skin can mimic spatiotemporal human perception and monitors real-time human physiological signals in non-invasive rational strategy. More importantly, nanoscale ferro– and piezo–electricity (d33~−20 pm/V) in GNFs, realized by piezoresponse force microscopy allow the bio-e-skin to be self-powered with excellent operational stability (over 108,000 cycles) and anti-fatigue (over 6 months) properties which solve the complication of external power supply for pressure sensing applications.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.04.028
Dynamic Tactile Sensing: Perception of Fine Surface Features with Stress Rate Sensing,323,"Most robot tactile sensing research has focused on the static perception of object shape with tactile array sensors. In contrast, dynamic tactile sensing is presented, which is defined as sensing during motion for perception of high spatial and temporal frequencies. Applications include sensing fine surface features and textures and monitoring contact conditions for dextrous manipulation. One type of dynamic tactile sensor, the stress rate sensor, is described in detail here. It uses piezoelectric polymer transducers to measure the changes in stress induced in the sensor’s rubber skin as it traverses small surface features and textures. The signals are interpreted with the aid of a solid mechanics model of the contact interaction and a linear deconvolution filter. Experimental verification of the sensor’s performance, including the detection of surface features only 6.5 μm high, are presented. © 1993 IEEE",,,,,,,,10.1109/70.238278
I feel it in my fingers: Haptic guidance on touch surfaces,324,"Touch screens are on the rise and replace traditional knobs and buttons at a fast pace. However, their lack of tangible guidance and feedback can become a problem in scenarios where visual attention is scarce. Besides dynamic tactile feedback by vibrations, the usability of touch screens can be improved by static haptic structures such as shaped or structured surfaces. In this paper we describe the prototype of an in-vehicle application using unimanual four-finger interaction and haptic guidance in order to avoid visual distraction from the primary task of driving. We built a low fidelity prototype with static haptics using an Android tablet and silicone foil. A user study showed that flexible positioning of touch buttons mapped to the user's fingers was more convenient and produced fewer errors than fixed positioning. A curved haptic border provided the user with orientation and allowed a new selection mode: dragging buttons over the edge resulted in a reduced interaction time when compared to double tapping. We present several different variants for unimanual multifinger interaction on planar and non-planar surfaces. Our results can support the development of future concepts for blind interaction.

Intact 2D-form recognition despite impaired tactile spatial acuity in complex regional pain syndrome type I,325,"Tactile acuity measured by 2-point discrimination performance is impaired in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). This is mirrored by pain-associated shrinkage of the cortical representation of the affected limb. We investigated whether, also, more complex tactile performance assessed by a dynamic 2D-form perception task is disturbed in CRPS-I patients. Therefore, we developed a Braille-like recognition task (BT) for geometrical dot pattern identification by dynamic touch. We studied 47 healthy volunteers (Study I) and compared them to 16 CRPS-I patients (Study II). Besides recognition time and error quote of the BT, we assessed static 2-point discrimination thresholds (TPDT). In healthy subjects, the performance in the BT correlated significantly with age and TPDT. In CRPS patients, TPDT was significantly increased on the affected side compared to sex- and age-matched controls from study I (2.98 ± 0.84 mm vs 2.05 ± 0.82 mm, P < 0.01). The performance in the BT was not impaired in CRPS-I patients (compared to sex- and age-matched controls from study I) and was not correlated to the TPDT. The intact 2D-form recognition ability in CRPS-I patients might be explained by intact dynamic tactile and proprioceptive functions, which appear to be uncompromised by the impaired static tactile perception, provided that the spacing of the dot pattern is above the individual tactile acuity. These intact 2D-form perception capacities may also be related to higher sensory integration functions like the visual system and intact semantic understanding, which may be spared by the cortical reorganization phenomena in CRPS-I. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

RoboGraphics,326,"Tactile graphics are a common way to present information to people with vision impairments. Tactile graphics can be used to explore a broad range of static visual content but aren’t well suited to representing animation or interactivity. We introduce a new approach to creating dynamic tactile graphics that combines a touch screen tablet, static tactile overlays, and small mobile robots. We introduce a prototype system called RoboGraphics and several proof-of-concept applications. We evaluated our prototype with seven participants with varying levels of vision, comparing the RoboGraphics approach to a flat screen, audio-tactile interface. Our results show that dynamic tactile graphics can help visually impaired participants explore data quickly and accurately.",,,,,,,,10.1145/3308561.3353804
Haptic perceptual intent in quiet standing affects multifractal scaling of postural fluctuations,327,"Research on dynamic touch has shown that when a rod strapped to the shoulders is wielded via axial rotations, flexions-extensions, and lateral bending of the trunk, participants can selectively perceive whole rod length and partial rod length (e.g., a leftward segment) with precision comparable to wielding by hand (Palatinus, Carello&Turvey, 2011). The present research addressed whether this haptic ability is preserved in quiet standing, when postural control is limited to center of pressure (COP) fluctuations at the mm/ms scale, and, if so, whether the intentions (""perceive partial,"" ""perceive whole"") are distinguishable within the fluctuations. Given standard manipulations of rod length and attached mass, participants provided significantly distinct, appropriately scaled, whole and partial estimates of rod length. COP displacement time series were subjected to multifractal, detrended fluctuation analysis. The resultant spectrum of fractal scaling exponents for gradually different-sized fluctuations revealed that ""perceive partial"" was manifest as larger exponents for progressively smaller fluctuations than ""perceive whole."" Our results indicate (a) that the significant mechanical variables for haptically perceiving object extent are available in the small scale of normal body sway, and (b) that these seemingly ""passive"" movements reflect the intention of the perceiver.",,,,,,,,10.1037/a0037247
The development and utilization of a scale to measure adolescents' attitudes toward peers who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices,328,"Purpose: Study 1 developed the Assessment of Attitudes Toward Augmentative and Alternative Communication-2 (AATAAC-2) to assess adolescents' attitudes toward peers who use AAC. Study 2 used the AATAAC-2 to examine influences of familiarity with people with disabilities; type of AAC device; and various combinations of gender of rater, AAC user, and communication partner on adolescents' attitudes. Method: In Study 1, 194 adolescents viewed videotapes depicting adolescents using AAC, then completed AATAAC-2. Study 2 utilized 8 videotapes depicting 4 different gender combinations of AAC user and communication partner as experimental stimuli. Each gender combination was filmed twice: once with a static touch screen device, and once with a dynamic touch screen device. One-hundred thirty-six adolescents were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 8 videos. Participants then completed AATAAC-2. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that AATAAC-2 has adequate psychometric properties. Raters' responses in Study 2 indicated no main effect of device type; girls were more positive than boys; and familiarity with peers with disabilities was associated with more positive attitudes. No 2-way interactions were significant; 3-way interaction of level of familiarity, gender, and type of device used was significant. Conclusions: Familiarity and gender contribute to adolescents' attitudes; type of AAC device combined with these factors to influence attitudes © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",,,,,,,,10.1044/1092-4388(2009/07-0140)
Adaptations posturales lors de gestuelles specifiques aux sports de combat. / Postural adaptations during specific combative sport movements.,329,"Athletic learning and training allow sportsmen to acquire new mental and motor abilities. Nevertheless, sensory integration mechanisms and gesture automation differ according to the discipline practised. Our study planned to appreciate a possible differentiation in the realization of a characteristic martial movement, in relation to the subjects' level of expertise. Two groups of sportsmen (practicing karate or French boxing) were submitted to postural control investigation; each had to execute a strike specific for his discipline on a static platform. The displacement of the center of foot pressure (CFP) consecutive to Choku Tsuki or frontal kick were recorded on statokinesigrams and stabilograms. Karate and French boxing technicians showed a better balance control than novices or competitors. The influence of visual afferences decreased with the fighters' level of expertise. However, visual information was necessary for postural readjustments in order to keep balance during self-generated motion. CFP displacements necessary for strike release and generated by the movement varied depending on the type of touch. Finally, postural adjustments minimized balance perturbations consecutive to voluntary movements. Combative sports training therefore seems to improve posture regulation, in terms of individual sensorimotor strategies as well as to kick speed.",,,,,,,,
Effortful Touch with Minimum Movement: Revisited,330,"The ecological static moment-torque model proposed by C. Carello, P. Fitzpatrick, I. Domaniewicz, T. C. Chan, and M. T. Turvey (1992) does not uniquely explain the perception of rod length by static holding. Guided by a mechanical analysis of the gravitational forces and torques produced in the hand as it statically holds rods of different lengths and materials at different orientations, we offer 2 additional theoretical explanations, the force - torque and weight - percept models. Experiment 1 demonstrates that all 3 models predict perceived rod length with considerable success. Experiment 2 provides clear experimental support for the force - torque and weight - percept models over the static moment - torque model. Experiment 3 pits the former 2 models against each other. Current results favor the weight - percept model. Implications for theories of haptic weight perception and design of a new tactile sensor are also considered.",,,,,,,,10.1037/0096-1523.22.4.851
The role of parietal cortex in awareness of self-generated movements: A transcranial magnetic stimulation study,331,"Awareness of self-generated movements arises from comparing motor plans, and the accompanying (hypothetical) efference copy, with the visual and proprioceptive consequences of movement. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate the role of a posterior region in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in this process. Nine healthy volunteers performed a finger extension actively and passively while wearing a CyberGlove; the glove recorded these (actual) finger movements and used this information in real time to move a virtual hand displayed on a computer screen. To assess the participant's awareness of movement onset, we introduced a delay between the onset of the actual and virtual movement (60-270 ms, 30 ms increments); the task was to judge whether the virtual hand movements were delayed relative to the actual hand movements. Low-frequency rTMS (15 min, 0.6 Hz) was applied either over the left SPL or the left temporal cortex (control site) to decrease excitability of these regions and, in turn, test their role in the awareness of self-generated movement. Following the SPL stimulation, participants' assessments of asynchrony were impaired for active but not passive movements. No significant changes were observed after rTMS applied over the control site. We suggest that these findings are consistent with the role of the SPL in evaluating the temporal congruency of peripheral (visual) and central (efference copy) signals associated with self-generated movements. As such, this region may contribute to the sense of 'agency' and its disturbances in disorders such as apraxia and schizophrenia.",,,,,,,,10.1093/cercor/13.9.962
Functional connectivity between the cerebellum and somatosensory areas implements the attenuation of self-generated touch,332,"Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense and less ticklish than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with fMRI to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.",,,,,,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1732-19.2019
Teaching a humanoid robot to draw 'shapes',333,"The core cognitive ability to perceive and synthesize 'shapes' underlies all our basic interactions with the world, be it shaping one's fingers to grasp a ball or shaping one's body while imitating a dance. In this article, we describe our attempts to understand this multifaceted problem by creating a primitive shape perception/synthesis system for the baby humanoid iCub. We specifically deal with the scenario of iCub gradually learning to draw or scribble shapes of gradually increasing complexity, after observing a demonstration by a teacher, by using a series of self evaluations of its performance. Learning to imitate a demonstrated human movement (specifically, visually observed end-effector trajectories of a teacher) can be considered as a special case of the proposed computational machinery. This architecture is based on a loop of transformations that express the embodiment of the mechanism but, at the same time, are characterized by scale invariance and motor equivalence. The following transformations are integrated in the loop: (a) Characterizing in a compact, abstract way the 'shape' of a demonstrated trajectory using a finite set of critical points, derived using catastrophe theory: Visual Program (AVP); (b) Transforming the AVP into a Concrete Motor Goal (CMG) in iCub's egocentric space; (c) Learning to synthesize a continuous virtual trajectory similar to the demonstrated shape using the discrete set of critical points defined in CMG; (d) Using the virtual trajectory as an attractor for iCub's internal body model, implemented by the Passive Motion Paradigm which includes a forward and an inverse motor model; (e) Forming an Motor Program (AMP) by deriving the 'shape' of the self generated movement (forward model output) using the same technique employed for creating the AVP; (f) Comparing the AVP and AMP in order to generate an internal performance score and hence closing the learning loop. The resulting computational framework further combines three crucial streams of learning: (1) motor babbling (self exploration), (2) imitative action learning (social interaction) and (3) mental simulation, to give rise to sensorimotor knowledge that is endowed with seamless compositionality, generalization capability and body-effectors/task independence. The robustness of the computational architecture is demonstrated by means of several experimental trials of gradually increasing complexity using a state of the art humanoid platform. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s10514-011-9229-0
Roles of movement and temporal factors in spatial learning,334,"Previous experiments suggested that rats can learn to discriminate between adjacent arms of an eight-arm radial maze if they have an intact hippocampal system and are allowed to move around on the maze. These requirements are consistent with the hypothesis that this discrimination involves hippocampus-based spatial learning. We examined the importance of self-generated movement in this form of learning by moving rats manually ('passive movement') between two adjacent maze arms within a single training trial. Rats moved passively between arms (only one of which contained food) within trials learned to discriminate between the arms, as measured by a conditioned preference for the food arm when both arms were empty. This form of learning was impaired by lesions of fimbria-fornix, but was unaffected by lesions of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Normal rats that were picked up and replaced on the same arm within trials and experienced their food and no food arms on different daily trials failed to learn the same discrimination. These findings suggest that self-generated movement is not required for spatial learning that may be mediated by a hippocampal system; rather, movement may simply serve to provide information from different locations about the cues in an environment.",,,,,,,not entirely clear if there was also an active condition,10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1997)7:5<501::AID-HIPO6>3.0.CO;2-J
The extrastriate cortex distinguishes between the consequences of one's own and others' behavior,335,"The extrastriate body area (EBA) is traditionally considered a category-selective region for the visual processing of static images of the human body. Recent evidence challenges this view by showing motor-related modulations of EBA activity during self-generated movements. Here, we used functional MRI to investigate whether the EBA distinguishes self- from other-generated movements, a prerequisite for the sense of agency. Subjects performed joystick movements while the visual feedback was manipulated on half of the trials. The EBA was more active when the visual feedback was incongruent to the subjects' own executed movements. Furthermore, during correct feedback evaluation, the EBA showed enhanced functional connectivity to posterior parietal cortex, which has repeatedly been implicated in the detection of sensorimotor incongruence and the sense of agency. Our results suggest that the EBA represents the human body in a more integrative and dynamic manner, being able to detect an incongruence of internal body or action representations and external visual signals. In this way, the EBA might be able to support the disentangling of one's own behavior from another's. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.030
Hand Movement Strategies in Telecontrolled Motion Along 2-D Trajectories,336,"The paper evaluates the performance and tries to identify the strategies of human operators (HO's) teleoperating a robot along 2-D-trajectories in simulations of place-like tasks in an obstacle encumbered environment. The experiments utilize computer graphic simulations of a remote robot whose end-effector displacements are dynamically controlled in the a’ - Y plane by the HO's hand displacements. Four different modes are selected to provide suggested trajectories to the HO's that begin at the initial point of the robot's end-effector and end in the landing zone. For each mode, two different visual frames of reference are used to present the remote scene viewed by the HO: a stationary view of the environment, or a view from the end-effector of the robot, which produces the sensation of a mobile environment. The performance is described in the various displayed conditions in terms of movement duration, spatial and temporal errors, and energy. The data show that performance depends on the nature of the cues and instructions provided to the operators. Comparative analysis of the various conditions suggests that visual feedback position control is used when continuous static or dynamic information about the trajectory is provided, while feedforward control, corrected by sampled visual information, is adopted when a self-generated movement can be planned and executed. The data also show that for a given set of execution cues, an equivalent performance is achieved in both visual frames of reference. A fifth mode of trajectory presentation, suggested by the results of the former analysis, has been tested. This mode, which presents a few specific spatial cues (gates) on the screen during the execution of the movement, combines the features for trajectory planning and sampled visual feedback position control. This last mode yields higher performance. © 1992 IEEE",,,,,,,,10.1109/21.148427
The neural encoding of self-generated and externally applied movement: Implications for the perception of self-motion and spatial memory,338,"The vestibular system is vital for maintaining an accurate representation of self-motion. As one moves (or is moved) toward a new place in the environment, signals from the vestibular sensors are relayed to higher-order centers. It is generally assumed the vestibular system provides a veridical representation of head motion to these centers for the perception of self-motion and spatial memory. In support of this idea, evidence from lesion studies suggests that vestibular inputs are required for the directional tuning of head direction cells in the limbic system as well as neurons in areas of multimodal association cortex. However, recent investigations in monkeys and mice challenge the notion that early vestibular pathways encode an absolute representation of head motion. Instead, processing at the first central stage is inherently multimodal. This minireview highlights recent progress that has been made towards understanding how the brain processes and interprets self-motion signals encoded by the vestibular otoliths and semicircular canals during everyday life. The following interrelated questions are considered. What information is available to the higher-order centers that contribute to self-motion perception? How do we distinguish between our own self-generated movements and those of the external world? And lastly, what are the implications of differences in the processing of these active vs. passive movements for spatial memory? © 2014 Cullen.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fnint.2013.00108
Mapping the perceptual topology of auditory space permits the creation of hyperstable virtual acoustic environments,339,"The perception of acoustic motion is not uniform as a function of azimuth; listeners need roughly twice as much motion at the side than at the front to judge the two motions as equivalent. Self-generated acoustic motion perception has also been shown to be distorted. Sounds moved slightly with the listener's head are more consistently judged to be world-stable than those that are truly static. These distortions can be captured by a model that incorporates a head-centric warping of perceived sound location, characterized by a displacement in apparent sound location away from the acoustic midline. Such a distortion has been demonstrated; listeners tend to overestimate azimuth when they are asked to point at a sound source while keeping their head and eyes fixated ahead of them. Here we show that this mathematical framework may be inverted and we demonstrate the benefits of remapping sound source locations toward the auditory midline. We show that listeners prefer different amounts of spatial remapping, but none preferred no remapping. Modelling shows minimal impact on spatial release from masking for small amounts of remapping, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve a more stable perceptual environment without sacrificing speech intelligibility in spatially complex environments.",,,,,,,,10.1250/ast.41.245
Perceived loudness of self-generated sounds is differentially modified by expected sound intensity,340,"Performing actions with sensory consequences modifies physiological and behavioral responses relative to otherwise identical sensory input perceived in a passive manner. It is assumed that such modifications occur through an efference copy sent from motor cortex to sensory regions during performance of voluntary actions. In the auditory domain most behavioral studies report attenuated perceived loudness of self-generated auditory action-consequences. However, several recent behavioral and physiological studies report enhanced responses to such consequences. Here we manipulated the intensity of self-generated and externally-generated sounds and examined the type of perceptual modification (enhancement vs. attenuation) reported by healthy human subjects. We found that when the intensity of self-generated sounds was low, perceived loudness is enhanced. Conversely, when the intensity of self-generated sounds was high, perceived loudness is attenuated. These results might reconcile some of the apparent discrepancies in the reported literature and suggest that efference copies can adapt perception according to the differential sensory context of voluntary actions.",,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0127651
Evoked activity of human brain during active and passive perception of facial emotions,341,"Twenty two right-handed subjects were asked either to identify sad, neutral, or laughing faces presented on a computer monitor or to view passively the same pictures without classification. Visual evoked potentials were recorded from F3/4, C3/4, P3/4, O1/2, and T5/6 derivations. In comparison with the passive viewing, the emotion recognition was characterized by the higher level of cortical activity reflected in the higher N1, N2, N3 amplitudes and shortened latencies of N1, P2, and N2 waves. In contrast, the latencies of the later P3 and N3 waves were longer. During emotion recognition, the dynamical brain mapping technique revealed symmetrical activation of the frontocentral areas and only the right-side activation during the passive perception. Factor analysis demonstrated a complication of N2 structure in the task of face emotion recognition. A principal component corresponding to the descending part of the N2 wave was revealed, which probably reflected the stage of image classification.",,,,,,,,
Olfactory short-term memory encoding and maintenance - An event-related potential study,342,"This study examined whether the memory encoding and short term maintenance of olfactory stimuli is associated with neurophysiological activation patterns which parallel those described for sensory modalities such as vision and auditory. We examined olfactory event-related potentials in an olfactory change detection task in twenty-four healthy adults and compared the measured activation to that found during passive olfactory stimulation. During the early olfactory post-processing phase, we found a sustained negativity over bilateral frontotemporal areas in the passive perception condition which was enhanced in the active memory task. There was no significant lateralization in either experimental condition. During the maintenance interval at the end of the delay period, we still found sustained activation over bilateral frontotemporal areas which was more negative in trials with correct - as compared to incorrect - behavioural responses. This was complemented by a general significantly stronger frontocentral activation.Summarizing, we were able to show that olfactory short term memory involves a parallel sequence of activation as found in other sensory modalities. In addition to olfactory-specific frontotemporal activations in the memory encoding phase, we found slow cortical potentials over frontocentral areas during the memory maintenance phase indicating the activation of a supramodal memory maintenance system. These findings could represent the neurophysiological underpinning of the 'olfactory flacon', the olfactory counter-part to the visual sketchpad and phonological loop embedded in Baddeley's working memory model. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.083
Concurrent cognitive task may improve motor work performance and reduce muscle fatigue,343,"Performance of certain cognitive tasks either during physical load or in rest pauses between boosts might lead to slowing of muscle fatigue and fatigue related decline in performance. Seventeen right-handed healthy volunteers (age 24±1.4, 8 males) participated in this study, aiming to investigate the effect of the level of the cognitive information processing - 1) passive perception of audio stimuli, 2) active stimuli discrimination, 3) active stimuli discrimination following motor response - on motor task performance (handgrip test 30% and 7% of MVC) and muscle fatigue development. Cognitive tasks show the following effects on motor work: i) Perceived fatigue during 30 % MVC (fatiguing) condition developed slower if participant pressed button in response to deviant acoustic stimuli, as compared to passive listening. Counting task, an active task without motor component, took the intermediate position and did not differ significantly from two other cognitive tasks. ii) MVC after 30% MVC (fatiguing) condition tended to decrease stronger when accompanied with passive listening in comparison with both active tasks. iii) Motor task performance during 30% MVC (fatiguing) condition was better for active cognitive task with motor component than for passive task.

The Bright Side of MAUP: an Enquiry on the Determinants of Industrial Agglomeration in the United States,344,"In many passive visual tasks, human perceptual judgments are contrast dependent. To explore whether these contrast dependencies of visual perception also affect closed-loop manual control tasks, we examined visuomotor performance as humans actively controlled a moving luminance-defined line over a range of contrasts. Four subjects were asked to use a joystick to keep a horizontal line centered on a display as its vertical position was perturbed by a sum of sinusoids under two control regimes. The total root mean square (RMS) position error decreased quasi-linearly with increasing log contrast across the tested range (mean slope across subjects: -8.0 and -7.7% per log2 contrast, for the two control regimes, respectively). Frequency-response (Bode) plots showed a systematic increase in open-loop gain (mean slope: 1.44 and 1.30 dB per log2 contrast, respectively), and decrease in phase lag with increasing contrast, which can be accounted for by a decrease in response time delay (mean slope: 32 and 40 ms per log2 contrast, respectively). The performance data are well fit by a Crossover Model proposed by McRuer and Krendel, which allowed us to identify both visual position and motion cues driving performance. This analysis revealed that the position and motion cues used to support manual control under both control regimes appear equally sensitive to changes in stimulus contrast. In conclusion, our data show that active control of a moving visual stimulus is as dependent on contrast as passive perception and suggest that this effect is attributed to a shared contrast sensitivity early in the visual pathway, before any specialization for motion processing",,,,,,,,10.2139/ssrn.1457625
Active and passive perceptual learning in the visually impaired,345,"Active and passive perceptual training methods were tested with 30 macular degeneration patients to improve their residual vision. Four different measures assessed improvement: a reading test, the Frostig Figure Ground Test (FFG), the Bender-Bestalt Test, and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test (FM-100). Participants were grouped according to two levels of impairment (moderate or severe) and three training conditions (active, passive, and control) in a 2 x 3 multivariate design. It was expected that the training sessions would improve visual task performance, and that active participants would show more improvement than other groups. A multivariate ANOVA found an overall main effect for the learning factor, and univariate tests showed that the active group improved significantly more than the passive and control groups on the FFG test. The main conclusion was that perceptual training may contribute to successful visual adjustment and that the effect of training is not limited to a particular level of visual impairment.",,,,,modality: visual & visually-impaired participants,,not sure what's the task,
KINAESTHETIC SENSITIVITY AND MOTOR PERFORMANCE OF CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL CO‐ORDINATION DISORDER,347,"Earlier research has demonstrated a number of variables contributing to motor co‐ordination problems (clumsiness) in children.

Use of micro-computed tomography to evaluate the effects of exercise on preventing the degeneration of articular cartilage in tail-suspended rats,350,"Abstract Space flight has been shown to induce bone loss and muscle atrophy, which could initiate the degeneration of articular cartilage. Countermeasures to prevent bone loss and muscle atrophy have been explored, but few spaceflight or ground-based studies have focused on the effects on cartilage degeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of exercise on articular cartilage deterioration in tail-suspended rats. Thirty-two female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=8 in each): tail suspension (TS), tail suspension plus passive motion (TSP), tail suspension plus active exercise (TSA), and control (CON) groups. In the TS, TSP, and TSA groups, the rat hindlimbs were unloaded for 21 days by tail suspension. Next, the cartilage thickness and volume, and the attenuation coefficient of the distal femur were evaluated by micro-computed tomography (μCT). Histological analysis was used to assess the surface integrity of the cartilage, cartilage thickness, and chondrocytes. The results showed that: (1) the cartilage thickness on the distal femur was significantly lower in the TS and TSP groups compared with the CON and TSA groups; (2) the cartilage volume in the TS group was significantly lower compared with the CON, TSA, and TSP groups; and (3) histomorphology showed that the chondrocytes formed clusters where the degree of matrix staining was lower in the TS and TSP groups. There were no significant differences between any of these parameters in the CON and TSA groups. The cartilage thickness measurements obtained by μCT and histomorphology correlated well.

Indications: Loss of active flexion of the interphalangeal (IP) joint of the thumb if there is a transection of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon at the tendon channel of the thumb or thenar and direct suture is not possible but the tendon channel is intact, as alternative procedure to a free tendon graft if the transection is proximal to the tendon channel and the muscle of the FPL is contracted/injured or the FPL tendon is unharmed but the FPL muscle is partially or complete paralyzed. Contraindications: Insufficiency of the FPL tendon channel, impairment of the superficial or deep flexor tendon of the ring finger, limited passive motion of the proximal and distal thumb joints, acute local general infection and non-compliance or incapacity of the patient. Surgical technique: The surgical technique depends on the necessity of transosseous refixation of the FDS IV at the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb or the possibility of woven sutures through the FPL proximal to the tendon channel. If the tendon channel is intact the distal part of the FPL tendon is shortened to 1 cm, the FDS IV tendon is cut distal to the chiasma of Camper, pulled through the carpal tunnel and moved into the channel of the FPL tendon and fixed transosseously through the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. If the transection of the FPL tendon is located proximal to the tendon channel and muscle of the FPL is injured, FDS IV tendon will be woven using the Pulvertaft technique through the FPL tendon at the distal forearm. Postoperative management: Postoperative 6 weeks motion of thumb flexion without resistance in relieved position of the thumb through a thermoplast splint and 6 weeks of functional use of the hand with increasing weight bearing. Results: In this study 10 patients with FDS IV transposition to reconstruct an isolated rupture of the FPL tendon could be followed for an average of 4.1 years postoperatively. The active range of motion of the IP joint of the thumb averaged 65 (10-100), 8/10 patients achieved an equal active and passive range of motion of the IP joint of the thumb, in 2 patients some flexion insufficiency remained, 9 patients could reach the fingertip of the small finger with the thumb and 1 patient lacked 3 mm. Contracture of the proximal thumb joint developed in two patients. After removal of the FDS IV tendon two patients developed contracture of the PIP joint of the ring finger. The grip force was reduced to 81 %, lateral grip to 83 % and pinch grip to 77 %. The DASH score averaged 18 (0-31) and 8/10 patients would choose to undergo this surgery again. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s00064-013-0256-1
Comparison of comfort and perceived risk of mechanical assistance of care beds,352,The purpose of this study was to compare comfort and risk between common bedding system and adjusted postures in continuous and separated given postures. Eighteen subjects took part in the measurement on flat bed and two types of adjustable care beds. Motion limitation and subtle influencing factors were also identified according to reflection of subjects. A virtual manbed system was established basing on the subjective assessment and body measurement to explore the man-bed relationship in passive motion process. Each model was divided and subdivided to simulate human body in all given postures in repeated circulation process. Influence of deformation and force distribution can be calculated in a dynamic system. Conclusions are drawn from results of both subjective evaluation and force distribution simulation. A series of recommendations are given to improve passive motion process basing on the conclusions. The results is also be useful in design process of mechanical assistance of nursing equipments. ©2010 IEEE.,,,,,,,,10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5661301
Regenerative brake control of cycling wheelchair with passive behavior,353,"In this study, we propose a cycling wheelchair that assists the movement of patients with impairment of lower extremities. The wheelchair is a pedal-driven system, similar to a bicycle, moved by the pedaling force of the patient's legs. Although the lower extremities of patients are impaired, they can use both legs to smoothly rotate the pedal. However, there are several barriers to use the cycling wheelchair in an outdoor environment such as steep slopes, steps, and obstacles. In this study, we develop a cycling wheelchair controlled by a regenerative brake system. The braking control provides several assistive functions including velocity control, gravity compensation, and step/obstacle avoidance. The regenerative brake system can also charge a battery during the braking control. However, in situations such as steep-slope climbing and emergency stopping, the regenerative brake cannot generate the required force/moment and an active control is required. In these situations, the control mode is altered from braking to active, and the assistive functions are invoked using the energy charged by the braking control. For safety reasons, we propose a passive motion control method of the cycling wheelchair, even if the wheelchair operates under active control. The proposed cycling wheelchair is validated in a series of experiments in this study. © 2013 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631122
Can passive mobilization provide clinically-relevant brain stimulation? A pilot eeg and nirs study on healthy subjects,354,"Lower limb rehabilitation is a fundamental part of post-acute care in neurological disease. Early commencement of active workout is often prevented by paresis, thus physical treatment may be delayed until patients regain some voluntary command of their muscles. Passive mobilization of the affected joints is mostly delivered in order to safeguard tissue properties and shun circulatory problems. The present paper investigates the potential role of early passive motion in stimulating cortical areas of the brain devoted to the control of the lower limb. An electro-mechanical mobilizer for the ankle joint (Toe-Up!) was implemented utilizing specially-designed shape-memory-alloy-based actuators. This device was constructed to be usable by bedridden subjects. Besides, the slowness and gentleness of the imparted motion, make it suitable for patients in a very early stage of their recovery. The mobilizer underwent technical checks to confirm reliability and passed the required safety tests for electric biomedical devices. Four healthy volunteers took part in the pre-clinical phase of the study. The protocol consisted in measuring of brain activity by EEG and NIRS in four different conditions: rest, active dorsiflexion of the ankle, passive mobilization of the ankle, and assisted motion of the same joint. The acquired data were processed to obtain maps of cortical activation, which were then compared. The measurements collected so far show that there is a similar pattern of activity between active and passive/assisted particularly in the contralateral premotor areas. This result, albeit based on very few observations, might suggest that passive motion provides somatosensory afferences that are processed in a similar manner as for voluntary control. Should this evidence be confirmed by further trials on healthy individuals and neurological patients, it could form a basis for a clinical use of early passive exercise in supporting central functional recovery. © 2013 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610308
"The effect of glenosphere diameter in reverse shoulder arthroplasty on muscle force, joint load, and range of motion",355,"Background: Little is known about the effects of glenosphere diameter on shoulder joint loads. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to investigate the effects of glenosphere diameter on joint load, load angle, and total deltoid force required for active abduction and range of motion in internal/external rotation and abduction. Methods: A custom, instrumented reverse shoulder arthroplasty implant system capable of measuring joint load and varying glenosphere diameter (38 and 42mm) and glenoid offset (neutral and lateral) was implanted in 6 cadaveric shoulders to provide at least 80% power for all variables. A shoulder motion simulator was used to produce active glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motion. All implant configurations were tested with active and passive motion with joint kinematics, loads, and moments recorded. Results: At neutral and lateralized glenosphere positions, increasing diameter significantly increased joint load (+12±21 N and +6 ± 9 N; P<.01) and deltoid load required for active abduction (+9±22 N and +11±15 N; P<.02), whereas joint load angle was unaffected (. P>.8). Passive internal rotation was reduced with increased diameter at both neutral and lateralized glenosphere positions (-6° ± 6° and -12°±6°; P<.002); however, external rotation was not affected (. P>.05). At neutral glenosphere position, increasing diameter increased the maximum angles of both adduction (+1°±1°; P=.03) and abduction (+8°±9°; P<.05). Lateralization also increased abduction range of motion compared with neutral (. P<.01). Conclusions: Although increasing glenosphere diameter significantly increased joint load and deltoid force, the clinical impact of these changes is presently unclear. Internal rotation, however, was reduced, which contradicts previous bone modeling studies, which we postulate is due to increased posterior capsular tension as it is forced to wrap around a larger 42 mm implant assembly.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.jse.2014.10.018
Treatment of subacute low back pain with a novel device for continuous passive motion of the spine: A report of three cases,356,"Patients experiencing subacute low back pain (LBP) represent a challenge for the physical therapist. There have been few studies on the use of continuous passive motion of the lumbar spine for the treatment of LBP. Three patients with symptoms of subacute LBP without radiculopathy were treated using a novel device for continuous passive motion of the lumbar spine. The protocol consisted of 12 sessions of lumbar continuous passive motion at 30 minutes per session two to three times per week for 4 to 5 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 12 sessions at 4 to 5 weeks by Oswestry score and active range of motion measurements by a blinded investigator. Clinically significant improvements in Oswestry score and consistent improvements in range were observed. A supervised protocol using a commercial device can benefit some patients with subacute LBP if supervised by a knowledgeable practitioner. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,,,,,,,10.1097/MJT.0b013e3181400451
Reflex responses to passive motion in normal and spastic man,357,"Responses elicited by passive stretch have been the focus of many investigations by clinicians and neurophysiologists, but responses during passive shortening have received little attention. The receptors responsible for stretch responses have been identified as the primary muscle spindle afferent. The most likely source of shortening responses is the secondary spindle afferents located in antagonistic muscle. This hypothesis is based on the known reflex effects of these afferents, the larger shortening responses in the flexors than the extensors and the increased shortening responses when the test position exaggerated the stretch of the antagonist. The lack of correlation between shortening responses and active tension in the antagonist argues against Golgi tendon organs which is the other possible receptor source.",,,,,,,,
Reliability and precision of hip proprioception methods in healthy individuals,358,"Objective: The goal of this study was to establish the intrasession and intersession reliability and precision of threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM), force sense (FS), and active joint position sense (JPS) tests for the hip in healthy individuals. Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Data were collected on 20 subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 years. They were physically active and had no history of major lower extremity injury or surgery or hip injuries. Interventions: Threshold to detect passive motion, FS, and active JPS were measured using a Biodex System 3 and a Vicon Motion Analysis System. Main Outcome Measures: Error scores were calculated as the absolute difference between the reference and reproduction values. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to assess intrasession and intersession reliability and precision. Results: Adduction showed good reliability for JPS, with an intersession ICC (SEM) of 0.753 (0.248 degrees). For TTDPM, abduction showed an intrasession ICC (SEM) of 0.825 (0.256 degrees) and adduction had an intrasession ICC (SEM) of 0.765 (0.266 degrees). The intersession ICCs (SEM) were as follows: flexion 0.810 (0.143 degrees), extension 0.777 (0.195 degrees), abduction 0.906 (0.176 degrees), and adduction 0.893 (0.144 degrees). Flexion showed a good intersession ICC for FS: 0.764 (0.932 Nm). Conclusions: Results indicate that a reliable and precise method of measuring hip TTDPM has been established. Further investigation is necessary to develop reliable and precise measurement methods for FS and active JPS of the hip and to identify if TTDPM is related to hip kinematics, hip kinetics, and muscle activation about the hip during functional tasks. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,,,,,,,10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181bcb155
Digital function following flexor tendon repair in Zone II: A comparison of immobilization and controlled passive motion techniques,359,"The performance of 50 consecutive digits in 37 patients was analyzed following flexor tendon repair in Zone 11. Twenty-five digits were managed by 3 1/2 weeks of immobilization followed by a program of gradually increased motion; 25 other digits by intermittent passive motion initiated within the first 5 days with active flexion commenced at 4 1/2 weeks. Results were graded according to the percentage of return of motion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. There were four ruptures in the immobilization group with no excellent results, 12% being rated good, 28%fair, and 11% poor. In the digits managed by early mobilization there were 36% excellent, 20% good, 16% fair, 24% poor; there was one rupture in this group. Early passive motion appeared to be an effective technique to improve the results of flexor tendon repairs in this area. © 1980, American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

An alternative early knee flexion regimen of continuous passive motion for total knee arthroplasty,360,"PURPOSE. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of an early application of continuous passive motion (CPM) regime on knee mobility after total knee arthroplasty. The early use of CPM for attaining knee flexion has been supported in a previous study, however, as yet there has been no randomised controlled trial to verify its effect as suggested. METHOD. Fifty- five subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups. Subjects in Group A were given an early flexion regimen of CPM. CPM was begun in the high dependency unit after operation with the range set at 70°to 100°flexion. Extension was advanced by 20°on the first postoperative day (50°- 100°) and to full extension on the second postoperative day (0°- 100°). Subjects in Group B adhered to the conventional program, that is, CPM was begun after operation with the range set at 0°to 40°flexion and progressed at daily increments of 10°. The CPM was implemented for two hours per session with two sessions per day. Subjects in the Group C had no CPM. All three groups received physiotherapy. Baseline measurements included the active and passive knee range of motion and number of days required to achieve 90°knee flexion. The universal goniometer was employed to measure the active and passive range of motion of the operated knee. The number of post-operative days (POD) to achieve 90°of passive knee flexion (discharge criteria) was recorded. Range of motion measurements were analysed using parametric tests of two-way (group by time) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Data regarding number of days to achieve 90°of knee flexion were analysed using the Kruskal, Wallis test. The alpha level for all statistical tests was set as 0.05. RESULTS. There was no significant interaction between group by time. The main effects demonstrated no significant differences between active and passive knee flexion and extension at baseline, third, fifth and seventh day post-operation. However, the median number of days required to achieve 90°of active knee flexion was shown to be statistically different at p < 0.05. CONCLUSION. There was no significant difference in the range of motion outcome between groups of patients who had been given two-hourly CPM twice per day, early flexion CPM and the control group. However, the study demonstrated the early flexion regimen of CPM was more effective in achieving 90°knee flexion than the conventional CPM program and no CPM.",,,,,,,,
Engineered in vitro models for the guidance of rehabilitation regimens that promote cartilage regeneration after repair surgery,361,"Microfracture (MFX) to repair focal lesions of articular cartilage injury is the most common cartilage repair procedure. MFX consists in the creation of small holes through the subchondral bone, the defect site is then filled with a clot rich in bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) that form of new fibrocartilaginous tissue. In general, early passive motion and limited weight bearing are adopted for rehabilitation after surgery, but it is unclear how these mechanical regimes affect BM-MSCs differentiation at the defect site and cartilage repair. To study this, we devised an in vitro model of cartilage defect filled with fibrin and BM-MSCs to mimic MFX repair. Composite constructs were then subjected to loading regimens simulating different rehabilitation exercise sessions. Weight bearing (compressive loading) was simulated using the Mechano-Active Tissue Engineering (MATE) system (MATEsystems, Clackamas, OR) with dynamic compression at 9N load force, 1.5Hz for 2 minutes followed by 2 minutes pause, repeated for 1h a day total, over 7 consecutive days. Passive motion (shear loading) was simulated using a rotatory cell culture system (RCCS TM-4;Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX). Samples were assayed by qRT-PCR, histology, GAG/DNA content, push-out test (integration of the construct). Statistical comparisons were done by paired T-test with significance of p < 0.05. Our results suggest that early passive motion exercise may be the most effective promoter of chondrogenesis in the early stages of MFX repair. Ultimately, we aim at identifying the long-term effects on regeneration of each exercise regime to guide the optimization of post-op rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,10.1089/ten.tea.2017.29003.abstracts LK  - http://limo.libis.be/resolver?&sid=EMBASE&issn=1937335X&id=doi:10.1089%2Ften.tea.2017.29003.abstracts&atitle=Engineered+in+vitro+models+for+the+guidance+of+rehabilitation+regimens+that+promote+cartilage+regeneration+after+repair+surgery&stitle=Tissue+Eng.+Part+A&title=Tissue+Engineering+-+Part+A&volume=23&issue=&spage=S126&epage=&aulast=Iseki&aufirst=T.&auinit=T.&aufull=Iseki+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S126-&date=2017&auinit1=T&auinitm=
Continuous assessment of gait velocity in Parkinson's disease from unobtrusive measurements,362,The ability to assess the neurological state of patients with neurodegenerative diseases on a continuous basis is an important component of future care for these chronically ill patients. In this paper we describe a set of algorithms to infer gait velocity and its variability using data from an unobtrusive sensor network by incorporating a simple dynamic description of a patient's movements within his or her residence. The sensors include a combination of passive motion detectors and active radio frequency identification tags. The dynamic model is a simple 4 state hidden Markov model. We investigated the ability of this model to assess gait velocity and its variability using data from a six month pilot study of several patients with early stage Parkinson's disease. © 2007 IEEE.,,,,,,,,10.1109/CNE.2007.369769
Roles of gravitational cues and efference copy signals in the rotational updating of memory saccades,363,"Primates are able to localize a briefly flashed target despite intervening movements of the eyes, head, or body. This ability, often referred to as updating, requires extraretinal signals related to the intervening movement. With active roll rotations of the head from an upright position it has been shown that the updating mechanism is 3-dimensional, robust, and geometrically sophisticated. Here we examine whether such a rotational updating mechanism operates during passive motion both with and without inertial cues about head/body position in space. Subjects were rotated from either an upright or supine position, about a nasal-occipital axis, briefly shown a world-fixed target, rotated back to their original position, and then asked to saccade to the remembered target location. Using this paradigm, we tested subjects' abilities to update from various tilt angles (0, ±30, ±45, ±90°), to 8 target directions and 2 target eccentricities. In the upright condition, subjects accurately updated the remembered locations from all tilt angles independent of target direction or eccentricity. Slopes of directional errors versus tilt angle ranged from -0.011 to 0.15, and were significantly different from a slope of 1 (no compensation for head-in-space roll) and a slope of 0.9 (no compensation for eye-in-space roll). Because the eyes, head, and body were fixed throughout these passive movements, subjects could not use efference copies or neck proprioceptive cues to assess the amount of tilt, suggesting that vestibular signals and/or body proprioceptive cues suffice for updating. In the supine condition, where gravitational signals could not contribute, slopes ranged from 0.60 to 0.82, indicating poor updating performance. Thus information specifying the body's orientation relative to gravity is critical for maintaining spatial constancy and for distinguishing body-fixed versus world-fixed reference frames.

Evoked potentials in a subject with a large-fibre sensory neuropathy below the neck,364,"The results from experiments in various modalities of evoked potentials are described in a subject with a complete large peripheral neuropathy below the neck. He has no tactile or position sensitivity below that level, but has retained fatigue, pain, and temperature sensation. Percutaneous electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves led to scalp recorded evoked potentials with thresholds and propagation velocities compatible with conduction along A-δ peripheral pathways. CO2 laser evoked potentials were similar to those seen in controls, further support for intact A-δ peripheral fibres. Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were recorded associated with active and passive movement of the middle finger. The former were normal, evidence that the termination of the MRCP is not dependent on peripheral feedback. By comparing passive MRCPs between controls and the subject it was possible to establish which parts of the potentials are visual and which are proprioceptive and to gain evidence of central reorganisation in the subject. Magnetic brain stimulation was used to show that the subject did not perceive induced movement, had a normal centrally originating silent period, and could focus his attention during real and imagined movement of the finger more successfully than could normal controls.",,,,,,,,10.1139/y95-034
Passive ankle dorsiflexion by an automated device and the reactivity of the motor cortical network,365,"Gait impairment is an important consequence of neurological disease. Passive mobilization of the affected lower limbs is often prescribed in order to safeguard tissue properties and prevent circulatory sequelae during paresis. However, passive movement could play a role also in stimulating cortical areas of the brain devoted to the control of the lower limb, so that deafferentation and learned non-use can be contrasted. The purpose of the present work is to investigate cortical involvement during active and passive movements of the ankle joint, in an attempt to gain deeper insight in the similarities between these two conditions. A wearable device to mobilize the ankle joint was implemented utilizing rotary shape memory alloy actuators. The technical characteristics of this actuator make it very compatible with the tight limitations on electromagnetic noise imposed by diagnostic instrumentation. Eleven healthy volunteers took part in the pre-clinical phase of the study. According to the protocol, brain activity was recorded by 165-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) under three different conditions: rest, active dorsiflexion of the ankle and passive mobilization of the same joint. The acquired data were processed to obtain cortical ERD/ERS (Event Related Desynchronization/ Synchronization) maps, which were then compared. The results of this analysis show that there are similar patterns of activity between active and passive movement, particularly in β band, in the contralateral primary sensorimotor, dorsal premotor and supplementary motor areas. This result, albeit obtained from healthy subjects, might suggest that passive motion provides somatosensory afferences that, to some extent, are processed in a similar manner as for voluntary control. Should this evidence be confirmed by further experiments on neurological patients, it could support the prescription of passive exercise as a surrogate of active workout, at least, so long as patients are paretic. © 2013 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/EMBC.2013.6611007
Integration of canal and otolith inputs by central vestibular neurons is subadditive for both active and passive self-motion: Implication for perception,366,"Traditionally, the neural encoding of vestibular information is studied by applying either passive rotations or translations in isolation. However, natural vestibular stimuli are typically more complex. During everyday life, our self-motion is generally not restricted to one dimension, but rather comprises both rotational and translational motion that will simultaneously stimulate receptors in the semicircular canals and otoliths. In addition, natural self-motion is the result of self-generated and externally generated movements. However, to date, it remains unknown how information about rotational and translational components of self-motion is integrated by vestibular pathways during active and/or passive motion. Accordingly, here, we compared the responses of neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing to rotation, translation, and combined motion. Recordings were made in alert macaques from neurons in the vestibular nuclei involved in postural control and self-motion perception. In response to passive stimulation, neurons did not combine canal and otolith afferent information linearly. Instead, inputs were subadditively integrated with a weighting that was frequency dependent. Although canal inputs were more heavily weighted at low frequencies, the weighting of otolith input increased with frequency. In response to active stimulation, neuronal modulation was significantly attenuated (~70%) relative to passive stimulation for rotations and translations and even more profoundly attenuated for combined motion due to subadditive input integration. Together, these findings provide insights into neural computations underlying the integration of semicircular canal and otolith inputs required for accurate posture and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during everyday life.",,,,,,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3540-14.2015
Secretion of prostaglandin E2 by rabbit proximal tubules,367,"This study was designed to evaluate prostaglandin secretion from bath to urine in isolated perfused rabbit proximal tubules. Active prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion occurred along the entire length of the proximal tubule, but the rate of net secretion was highest in the S2 segment of the proximal straight tubule. Sixteen percent of the PGE2 secreted in the proximal straight tubule was metabolized to other products. The PGE2 cell-to-bath ratio averaged 40 and the tubule fluid-to-bath ratio averaged 3.4. These findings suggest active transport of PGE2 across the peritubular membrane and passive movement across the luminal membrane. Indomethacin, probenecid, para-aminohippurate, and ouabain partially inhibited PGE2 cell accumulation and net secretion. PGE2 entered the urine of the perfused descending limb of Henle (DLH), but at a rate two orders of magnitude below that observed in the S2 segment of the proximal tubule. No evidence of active PGE2 secretion was observed in the DLH. These results suggest that PGE2 is secreted into the urine at substantial rates by the organic anion transport system of renal proximal tubules.",,,,,,,,10.1152/ajprenal.1979.237.4.f268
Alveolar fluid reabsorption is impaired by increased left atrial pressures in rats,368,"Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from increased hydrostatic pressures across the pulmonary circulation. We studied active Na + transport and alveolar fluid reabsorption in isolated perfused rat lungs exposed to increasing levels of left atrial pressure (LAP; 0-20 cmH 2O) for 60 min. Active Na + transport and fluid reabsorption did not change when LAP was increased to 5 and 10 cmH 2O compared with that in the control group (0 cmH 2O; 0.50 ± 0.02 ml/h). However, alveolar fluid reabsorption decreased by ∼50% in rat lungs in which the LAP was raised to 15 cmH 2O (0.25 ± 0.03 ml/h). The passive movement of small solutes ( 22Na + and [ 3H]mannitol) and large solutes (FITC-albumin) increased progressively in rats exposed to higher LAP. There was no significant edema in lungs with a LAP of 15 cmH 2O when all active Na + transport was inhibited by hypothermia or amiloride (10 -4 M) and ouabain (5 × 10 -4 M). However, when LAP was increased to 20 cmH 2O, there was a significant influx of fluid (-0.69 ± 0.10 ml/h), precluding the ability to assess the rate of fluid reabsorption. In additional studies, LAP was decreased from 15 to 0 cmH 2O in the second and third hours of the experimental protocol, which resulted in normalization of lung permeability to solutes and alveolar fluid reabsorption. These data suggest that in an increased LAP model, the changes in clearance and permeability are transient, reversible, and directly related to high pulmonary circulation pressures.",,,,,,,,10.1152/ajplung.2001.281.3.l591
Exploring the impact of visual and movement based priming on a motor intervention in the acute phase post-stroke in persons with severe hemiparesis of the upper extremity,369,"Purpose: Explore the potential benefits of using priming methods prior to an active hand task in the acute phase post-stroke in persons with severe upper extremity hemiparesis. Methods: Five individuals were trained using priming techniques including virtual reality (VR) based visual mirror feedback and contralaterally controlled passive movement strategies prior to training with an active pinch force modulation task. Clinical, kinetic, and neurophysiological measurements were taken pre and post the training period. Clinical measures were taken at six months post training. Results: The two priming simulations and active training were well tolerated early after stroke. Priming effects were suggested by increased maximal pinch force immediately after visual and movement based priming. Despite having no clinically observable movement distally, the subjects were able to volitionally coordinate isometric force and muscle activity (EMG) in a pinch tracing task. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of force during the pinch trace task gradually decreased over the training period suggesting learning may have occurred. Changes in motor cortical neurophysiology were seen in the unaffected hemisphere using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) mapping. Significant improvements in motor recovery as measured by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Assessment (UEFMA) were demonstrated at six months post training by three of the five subjects. Conclusion: This study suggests that an early hand-based intervention using visual and movement based priming activities and a scaled motor task allows participation by persons without the motor control required for traditionally presented rehabilitation and testing. Implications for Rehabilitation Rehabilitation of individuals with severely paretic upper extremities after stroke is challenging due to limited movement capacity and few options for therapeutic training. Long-term functional recovery of the arm after stroke depends on early return of active hand control, establishing a need for acute training methods focused distally. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an early hand-based intervention using virtual reality based priming and scaled motor activities which can allow for participation by persons without the motor control required for traditionally presented rehabilitation and testing.",,,,,,,,10.1080/09638288.2016.1226419

Physiological differentiation of cochlear microphonics in birds into de- and hyperpolarization,372,"When changing the metabolic conditions (anoxia, cyanide poisoning of the inner ear, hypothermia) the cochlear microphonic (CM) of birds differentiate into two compnents: a negative (CM-; polarity Scala tympani) and a positive one (CM+). CM- becomes much more impaired than CM+. Comparing these resluts with known facts in neurophysiology we concluded that CM- represents a hyperpolarization (active transport of ions), and CM+ a depolarization ()passive movement of ions) of the hair cell membrane. CM+ agrees with the excitatory phase of microphonic potential postulated by other authors (transmission of excitation from the snesory cell to the afferent neuron).",,,,,,,,
The ankle and subtalar joints,373,"The ankle and subtalar joint act together to provide a universal-joint type of linkage between the foot and leg, plantar flexion and inversion occurring together as do dorsiflexion and eversion of the hind foot. There was a small mean decrease with age in active and passive subtalar movement for eversion and inversion but this reduction was less than might have been expected; for active subtalar movement the mean of inversion decreased by 5° and eversion by 9°. There was no difference between the range of passive movement in men and women. For active subtalar movement there was minimal difference in inversion for the fourth and fifth decades, but for active subtalar eversion the males aged between 11 and 10 years were much more mobile than the females. Both active and passive ankle movements showed some decrease with age, but it is noticeable that it is particularly the active and passive ankle plantar flexion that decreases with age, the difference in means of the former being 13.5° and of the latter 11°. Dorsiflexion was slightly greater in the males for the 41-70 age groups but the females had highly significant increase in plantar flexion from age 21 to 70 years, probably related to the heel height of their footwear.",,,,,,,,
Does the direction of the whole body movement influence calculation processing?,374,"This study investigates the relationship between the movements of the whole body and numerical calculation, such as additions and subtractions. Starting from previous evidence on the horizontal and vertical axes, in the present study participants were required to count by adding or subtracting three while performing a motion on the circular axis (i.e., a clockwise or counterclockwise movement), in an active (i.e., walking) or passive mode (i.e., being pushed on a wheelchair). Results showed the presence of a relationship between numerical processing and the direction of the circular movement, both in an active and passive movement condition, but only for additions and only for male participants. Implications of the results for theories of embodied cognition are discussed.",,,,,,,,10.1421/87350
Downloaded from www.physiology.org/journal/jn,375,"Hoogenboom. Neural control of rhythmic human arm movement: phase dependence and task modulation of Hoffmann reflexes in forearm muscles. J Neurophysiol 89: 12-21, 2003. 10.1152/jn.00416.2002. Although we move our arms rhythmically during walking, running, and swimming, we know little about the neural control of such movements. Our working hypothesis is that neural mechanisms controlling rhythmic movements are similar in the human lumbar and cervical spinal cord. Thus reflex modulation during rhythmic arm movement should be similar to that seen during leg movement. Our main experimental hypotheses were that the amplitude of H-reflexes in the forearm muscles would be modulated during arm movement (i.e., phase-dependent) and would be inhibited during cycling compared with static contraction (i.e., task-dependent). Furthermore, to determine the locus of any modulation, we tested the effect that active and passive movement of the ipsilateral (relative to stimulated arm) and contralateral arm had on H-reflex amplitude. Subjects performed rhythmic arm cycling on a custom-made hydraulic ergometer in which the two arms could be constrained to move together (180° out of phase) or could rotate independently. Position of the stimulated limb in the movement cycle is described with respect to the clock face. H-reflexes were evoked at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions during static contraction as well as during rhythmic arm movements. Reflex amplitudes were compared between tasks at equal M wave amplitudes and similar levels of electromyographic (EMG) activity in the target muscle. Surface EMG recordings were obtained bilaterally from flexor carpi radialis as well as from other muscles controlling the wrist, elbow, and shoulder. Compared with reflexes evoked during static contractions, movement of the stimulated limb attenuated H-reflexes by 50.8% (P 0.005), 65.3% (P 0.001), and 52.6% (P 0.001) for bilateral, active ipsilateral, and passive ipsilateral movements, respectively. In contrast, movement of the contralat-eral limb did not significantly alter H-reflex amplitude. H-reflexes were also modulated by limb position (P 0.005). Thus task-and phase-dependent modulation were observed in the arm as previously demonstrated in the leg. The data support the hypothesis that neural mechanisms regulating reflex pathways in the moving limb are similar in the human upper and lower limbs. However, the inhibition of H-reflex amplitude induced by contralateral leg movement is absent in the arms. This may reflect the greater extent to which the arms can be used independently. I N T R O D U C T I O N We routinely perform rhythmic movements with the arms and legs during locomotor activities such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling. Numerous studies have revealed pha-sic patterns of muscle activity and reflex control associated with these forms of locomotion (Brooke et al. 1997; Schieppati 1987; Stein and Capaday 1988; Zehr and Stein 1999b). Many researchers have been interested in documenting the pattern of reflex control in these movements as a window into the neural control mechanisms on which the behaviors are predicated (Brooke et al. 1997). A particularly rich vein of study has been that of Hoffmann (H-) reflex modulation during walking and leg cycling. In a systematic set of experiments, Brooke and his colleagues evaluated the pattern of H-reflex modulation during leg cycling movement (Brooke et al. 1997). A distinct pattern of H-reflex attenuation (compared with control reflexes evoked while stationary) was observed during active (Brooke et al. 1992) and passive (McIlroy et al. 1992) movement of the stimulated leg as well as by active (McIlroy et al. 1992) and passive movement of the contralateral leg (Collins et al. 1993). Thus H-reflexes in the leg are modulated by motor task (i.e., task-dependent during rhythmic leg movement). The neural control mechanisms and patterns of reflex modulation during rhythmic arm cycling movements are not as well known. Cutaneous reflexes have also been studied during human leg cycling (Brooke et al. 1999; Brown and Kukulka 1993; Zehr et al. 2001b). During active leg movement, cutaneous reflexes are modulated with position in the movement cycle (i.e., phase-dependent) (Brown and Kukulka 1993). This phase dependency is absent during passive movement (Brooke et al. 1999). The pattern of cutaneous reflex modulation evoked by stimulation of the superficial radial nerve at the wrist (Zehr and Chua 2000) during rhythmic arm cycling movement shared some",,,,,,,,10.1152/jn.00416.2002
Active and passive scapulohumeral movement in healthy persons: A comparison,376,"Objectives: Clinical studies investigating shoulder complaints have found that active exercises and passive manipulation are not equally effective treatments, perhaps because active and passive movements align the individual shoulder girdle components differently. This study sought to investigate whether a significant difference exists in scapulohumeral rhythm of the healthy shoulder when the humerus is elevated actively or passively. Study Design: Both shoulders of 10 healthy volunteers (9 men: mean age 50 yrs) were studied using an electromagnetic coordinate system to locate the position of the scapula relative to the humerus and trunk. Scapula position in three dimensions was recorded at 10°intervals during active and passive humeral elevation in the coronal plane between 10°and 50°. Each shoulder was measured three times. Results: Analysis of variance showed that in all three planes of scapula movement (lateral rotation, backward tip, and retraction) the components of variance attributable to the differences in active and passive movement were less than 5%. Conclusions: During humeral elevation between 10°and 50°no significant difference exists between active and passive shoulder complex motion in healthy individuals. These findings may help to explain why passive manipulation is an effective treatment for shoulder complaints.",,,,,,,,10.1053/apmr.2000.0810028
The contribution of active body movement to visual development in evolutionary robots,377,"Inspired by the pioneering work by Held and Hein (1963) on the development of kitten visuo-motor systems, we explore the role of active body movement in the developmental process of the visual system by using robots. The receptive fields in an evolved mobile robot are developed during active or passive movement with a Hebbian learning rule. In accordance to experimental observations in kittens, we show that the receptive fields and behavior of the robot developed under active condition significantly differ from those developed under passive condition. A possible explanation of this difference is derived by correlating receptive field formation and behavioral performance in the two conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Space and spatial orientation,378,"Space and spatial orientation has been a subject of interest of researchers for many years. Spatial orientation can be divided into cued navigation and place navigation. The latter requires more complex neuronal computations and is considered to be a model of higher cognitive functions in animals. Allothetic orientation is based on determining the location of the subject with respect to orientating cues and gradients in its surrounding. Idiothetic orientation involves integrating the information generated during active and passive self-motion in order to obtain the actual position of the subject with respect to the starting point. This article reviews the historical evolution of spatial concepts, the types of orientation, and their neuronal implementation. Description of the most widely used methods of studying mechanisms of spatial orientation is also included.",,,,,,,,
Cerebellar unit responses of the mossy fibre system to passive movements in the decerebrate cat - I. Responses to static parameters,379,"1) Experiments were designed to detect how static parameters of natural, passive hand movements are encoded and integrated within the cerebellar cortex. For this purpose unit activity was recorded extracellularly from presumed mossy fibres (MF), presumed granule cells (GrC) and from Purkinje cells (PC) discharging with simple spikes (SS) and complex spikes (CS). With respect to the PC, our interest was focussed primarily on the SS activity. The recordings were performed in the intermediate part of the cerebellar anterior lobe of decerebrate cats. The animal's forepaw was passively moved around the wrist joint by an electronically controlled device. The movements were exactly reproducible so that peristimulus time histograms of the unit activity could be constructed. 2) At the input level (MF) and at the first level of integration within the cerebellar cortex (GrC), patterns with similar discharge characteristics were found. Such patterns could, to a limited extent, also be detected at the cerebellar output (SS of PC). However, in most cases of SS discharge, patterns were found with weak correlation between the tonic activity and static parameters of the movements. 3) Absolute paw position, amplitude, and duration of movements were found to be related over wide ranges to the activities of MF and GrC. Absolute position is directly encoded by tonic discharge during the low or high holding phases. Beside this, units were found without a correlation between the tonic discharge and the position of the nonmoving paw. However, in these units it was sometimes observed that the information about the momentary position or the information about the mean position was sometimes conveyed exclusively during the proceeding upward or downward movement. Thus, information about static parameters was transmitted only at times when a dynamic parameter (such as velocity) occurred. This type of position information encoding is termed ""indirect mode of transmission"". 4) A specific relationship between SS unit activity of PC and the absolute position of the forepaw or amplitude of the movement could be found primarily by using multiple ramps instead of single ramp movements. This was observed even if both types of ramp movements had the same velocity, individual amplitude, and tested range. However, on multiple ramp movements the paw generally remained for a shorter period at a specific position level as compared to the single ramp movements. 5) Apart from this timing phenomenon, a late movement response was observed, which results in a specific type of position information encoding on multiple ramp functions. 6) These results indicate that static parameters of a passive limb movement are conveyed via the MF input to the cerebellar cortex. Patterns related to these parameters undergo a change within the MF-, GrC-, Parallel fibre-, PC-system. Different modes of encoding these parameters were observed depending primarily on the neuronal niveau within the cerebellar cortex. Tonic discharge related e.g. to limb position was found at MF and GrC level. Such patterns resemble, at least to a certain extent, those obtained from different peripheral receptors. The high tonic SS activity never showed such a strong relationship to static parameters as observed at the input level; static parameters could be resolved only within relatively short periods of time, especially during the dynamic phases of the movement or during short periods immediately following these phases. This implies that the function of this part of the cerebellum, which is to provide correction signals, should be considered as a more dynamic process characterized by evaluating predominantly information about the momentary ongoing movement. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/BF00248790
Enhancing education through natural interaction with physical paper,380,"Pervasive computing environments have permeated current research and practice, unobtrusively augmenting existing environments with digital content. The present work, following a pervasive computing approach, proposes a framework to augment an educational environment, being a typical classroom or any studying environment. In this context, the work presented in this paper investigates unobtrusive interaction and support of active educational or studying activities through appropriate context-sensitive information. To this end, passive visual sensing is employed in order to unobtrusively perceive the current context and users’ actions, thus providing novel ways to implement natural interaction. The suitability of the proposed interaction technologies and overall approach has been demonstrated through three interactive applications integrated in the framework, each one supporting different interaction techniques and addressing different educational activities. Finally, a user experience evaluation of the three test-bed applications has been carried out, aiming to assess the applicability of the approach and the suitability of each of the proposed technologies to the educational tasks in hand.",,,,,,,,10.1007/s10209-014-0365-0
P.1.b.010 The P3a component of the event-related potential from passive visual task in patients with schizophrenia,381,"The paradigm effects were not enough to be elucidated, even though it is well known that the event-related potential P300 was useful for exploring schizophrenia. Most P300 studies require the subject to actively respond to the target stimulus, but P300-like waveforms also can be elicited with 'passive' auditory paradigms in which an intentional discrimination between the two tones is not required. These methods are of clinical interest, since they can be used with non-compliant subjects such as young children, individuals with demented illness, and difficult psychiatric patients. However, most passive auditory tasks elicit altered P300 components compared to those elicited by active processing. Indeed, conventional visual stimuli presented under passive viewing conditions can not elicit reliable P300 components because the attentional demands of a visual target in an oddball sequence are not compelling relative to the alerting qualities of an infrequent auditory target stimulus. Thus, passive and active paradigms can produce P300 waveforms because component outcomes are determined by the eliciting stimuli if only when their physical qualities coerce attentional engagement. This study was designed to examine that visual passive paradigm is appropriate for relatively uncooperative and admitted patients with schizophrenia. Visual 3 stimulus oddball paradigm was employed for admitted patients with schizophrenia (N=50) and controls (N=35). For the patients, the symptoms severity was assessed by Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). The paradigm was composed of standard (small circle, 80%), distractors (large rectangle, 10%), and targets (large circle, 10%) in a random manner once every 2 s. The passive task was presented first, and the subjects were instructed to look at the monitor in relaxed manner. The active task was presented in second session, and subjects were asked to press a mouse button to the targets. P3a to the distractors is elicited in passive and active tasks. P3b to the targets is elicited in active task. In active paradigm, the P3a and P3b were successfully acquired in all 35 control subjects (100%), but in only 35 patients (75%). In passive paradigm, the P3a was elicited for 45 patients (90%) as well as for 35 control subjects (100%). Passive P3a (F = 3.7, p = 0.08 in amplitude, F = 32, p< 0.0001 in latency), active P3a (F = 12.6, p = 0.001 in amplitude, F = 25, p< 0.0001 in latency), and active P3b (F = 2.6, p = 0.09 in amplitude, F = 14.3, p < 0.001)) were smaller and delayed in patients with schizophrenia. With using mixed between (groups) and within (anterior-posterior and laterality) repeated measurement ANOVA, the P300 components showed topographic differences between two groups (F = 4.4, p = 0.03 in passive P3a, F = 5.7, p = 0.001 in active P3a, and F = 5.4, p = 0.01 in active P3b). The passive 3 stimulus visual P300 paradigm could be used for further exploring the patients with schizophrenia without or minimizing losing the information from some patients who are uncooperative with using only the conventional active P300 paradigms.",,,,,,,,10.1016/s0924-977x(09)70352-9

Speech perception in noise with active and passive hearing protectors: Acoustical analysis,383,"This research project has compared the speech recognition scores for test fragments recorded in different kinds of realistic industrial noise, with both standard and active earplugs. The standard protectors block the incoming sound whereas the active work level-dependent. Acoustical analyses reveal the importance of global input sound pressure levels, especially for speech recognition with standard protectors. Furthermore, the active protector with maximal amplification hinders communication, possibly because it does not sufficiently preserve temporal variations and distorts the spectrum. Finally, the tested active protector with minimal amplification does not benefit entirely from the unmasking effects of binaural hearing. This project shows that speech recognition can be linked to the acoustical features of the signals under hearing protectors. A more formal relationship could facilitate further development of active protectors but a wider range of test samples is needed to reach a sufficiently accurate model.",,,,,,,,
Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEPS) and Selective Attention Revisited,384,"Evidence of peripheral filtering of auditory information at the cochlear and brainstem levels was sought using brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) recorded during auditory and visual tasks. It can be argued that the discrimination tasks used in the past to investigate peripheral filtering of sensory information in humans involve two levels of discrimination, the consequences of which result in two independent types of inhibition: crossmodal inhibition as a result of between‐modality discrimination, and intramodal inhibition as a result of within‐modality discrimination. Therefore, the observed effects on the BAEPs may reflect the extent to which these two types of inhibition are engaged. In this investigation a paradigm that included two non‐discrimination (passive) tasks and two discrimination (active) tasks was employed. BAEPs recorded during listening (a passive auditory task) provided a baseline measure, against which comparisons of BAEPs recorded during auditory and visual discrimination could be made for independent evidence of crossmodal and intramodal inhibition. The data in this study did not support the presence of two types of inhibition proposed above, or show evidence of peripheral filtering of auditory information at the cochlear and brainstem levels. However, the sensitivity of BAEPs to efferent system activation at the cochlea and hence their value as a tool in investigations of peripheral filtering in humans was questioned.

Response selectivity for multiple dimensions of frequency sweeps in the pallid bat inferior colliculus,385,"1. While hunting, the pallid bat uses passive sound localization at low frequencies to find terrestrial prey, and echolocation for general orientation. It must therefore process two different types of acoustic input at the same time. The pallid bat's echolocation pulse is a downward frequency-modulated (FM) sweep from 60 to 30 kHz. This study examined the response selectivity of single neurons in the pallid bat's central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) for FM sweeps, comparing the response properties of the high-frequency population, tuned to the biosonar pulse, with the low-frequency population, tuned below the pulse. The working hypothesis was that the high-frequency population would exhibit a response selectivity for downward FM sweeps that was not present in the low-frequency population. 2. Neurons were tested for their selectivity for FM sweep direction, duration, frequency range and bandwidth, and rate of frequency change. The extent to which they responded exclusively to tones, noise, and FM sweeps was also examined. Significant differences in the response properties of neurons in the two populations were found. In the low-frequency population, all neurons responded to tones, but only 50% responded to FM sweeps. Only 23% were selective for sweep direction. In the high-frequency population, all neurons responded to FM sweeps, but 31% did not respond to tones. Over one-half of this population was selective for sweep direction, and of those that were selective, all preferred the downward sweep direction of the biosonar pulse. A large percentage (31%) responded exclusively to downward sweeps, and not to tones or upward sweeps. None of the cells in either population responded to noise, or did so only at very high relative thresholds. 3. Both populations contained neurons that were selective for short stimulus durations that approximated the duration of the biosonar pulse, although the percentage was greater in the high-frequency population (58% vs. 20%). In the high-frequency population, 31% of the neurons tested for duration responded exclusively to both the sweep direction and duration of the biosonar pulse. 4. Downward FM-selective neurons, with one exception, were generally insensitive to the rate of frequency change of the FM sweep, as well as the frequency range and bandwidth of the sweep. They responded similarly to both the full 60- to 30-kHz sweep and to 5-kHz bandwidth portions of the full sweep. 5. The percentage of neurons in the entire recorded population that responded exclusively to downward FM sweeps approximating the biosonar pulse is an order of magnitude greater than has been reported in the IC of most other bats studied. This suggests that such selectivity is not needed simply for the selective detection of biosonar echoes. Instead, this extreme functional specialization in the pallid bat auditory midbrain may serve the demands of having to process active and passive acoustic information at the same time. The response selectivity observed may function to maintain the separation between two parallel channels for echolocation and passive listening.",,,,,,,,10.1152/jn.1994.72.3.1061
Environmental acoustic cues guide the biosonar attention of a highly specialised echolocator,386,"Sensory systems experience a trade-off between maximizing the detail and amount of sampled information. This trade-off is particularly pronounced in sensory systems that are highly specialised for a single task and thus experience limitations in other tasks. We hypothesised that combining sensory input from multiple streams of information may resolve this trade-off and improve detection and sensing reliability. Specifically, we predicted that perceptive limitations experienced by animals reliant on specialised active echolocation can be compensated for by the phylogenetically older and less specialised process of passive hearing. We tested this hypothesis in greater horseshoe bats, which possess morphological and neural specialisations allowing them to identify fluttering prey in dense vegetation using echolocation only. At the same time, their echolocation system is both spatially and temporally severely limited. Here, we show that greater horseshoe bats employ passive hearing to initially detect and localise prey-generated and other environmental sounds, and then raise vocalisation level and concentrate the scanning movements of their sonar beam on the sound source for further investigation with echolocation. These specialised echolocators thus supplement echo-acoustic information with environmental acoustic cues, enlarging perceived space beyond their biosonar range. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find consistent preferences for prey-related acoustic stimuli, indicating the use of passive acoustic cues also for detection of non-prey objects. Our findings suggest that even specialised echolocators exploit a wide range of environmental information, and that phylogenetically older sensory systems can support the evolution of sensory specialisations by compensating for their limitations.",,,,,,,,10.1242/jeb.165696
STUDENT DEVELOPERS' MEETUP. A UNIVERSITY PLATFORM TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE PART IN A COMMUNITY OF DEVELOPERS AND SPECIALISED COMPANIES,387,"Despite the growing interest of universities and schools in active student participation, today the learning process has turned into passive listening in the class and a few isolated alternative activities, if any. After completing their studies, students face the competitive professional world and they find many problems when they have to look for a job because they don't do well at some desired skills like participating in groups, acting as a team member or even as a team leader, collaborative work, communication skills, transmitting clear and structured ideas, problem solving using acquired knowledge to face new challenges, creativity skills, commercial vision, or development of business ideas, just to name a few. Cooperative learning methods have demonstrated to improve student engagement, retention of classroom material and improve students' motivation to learn, as well as students' interpersonal relationships and expectations for personal success, a part from the fact that students working in groups achieve significantly more than those students working individually. Despite that there is a great lack of cooperative learning activities integrated within syllabus and curricula. Other times the problem is that cooperative learning activities are isolated and far from the day to day life of the students leading to low student participation levels and consequently the academic progress and learning is diminished. In this paper we present a platform to encourage students to form a community of developers in the university. This community is composed mainly of students of engineering but it is also composed of professional engineers from different companies, and opened to other teachers and people in general interested in the topic. We will specifically describe the application to a computer science developers community but the proposed platform can be used in any engineering area: electrical, electronics, industrial, mechanics engineering, etc. For students to achieve the academic and social benefits the cooperative structure must be defined and implemented carefully. In this paper we will describe the platform details, the face-to-face interaction and the individual accountability for each student in the platform.",,,,,,,,
Human listening experiments on the psychophysics of ranging paradigms,388,"The ranging capabilities of the bats' sonar receiver
have been studied extensively in behavioral 2-AFC - experiments
employing the playback of artificial echoes to the animals'
echolocation pulses. Such procedures are thought to generate the
impression of phantom targets located at different distances. These
tests made use of two paradigms: range difference (RD), the
discrimination between different echo delays, and jitter versus
non-jitter (JNJ), the detection of a regularly alternating,
'jittering' delay against a reference of constant delay values. The
perceptional equivalence of these paradigms hypothesized by some
workers has been doubted by others and a third paradigm,
jitter-versus-jitter (JJ), which would require the discrimination of
different jitter amplitudes, has been proposed for the purpose of
clarifying this unresolved issue. In order to obtain a first glimpse
of the psychophysical properties of the stimuli delivered in the
ranging experiments, passive listening tasks with sequences of
repeated artificial 'pulse-echo-pairs' where designed for human
subjects according to all three mentioned rules and thresholds were
measured in an adaptive 3-AFC procedure. It could be demonstrated,
that the subjects' performance depended on a variety of stimulus
parameters (e.g., repetition rate, reference value of the
pulse-echo-delay and the characteristics of the individual
pulses). The nature of these relationships depended on the tested
paradigm, hinting at possible differences in the involved
mechanisms. Each paradigm seems to constitute an individual
perceptual task, with a somewhat closer relationship existing
between JNJ and JJ. The JNJ-performance depended on the
pulse-echo-delay of the reference stimulus, which weakens the view
that a grossly similar effect found in bats can be regarded as proof
for a specific internal representation of the stimuli along a range
axis in these animals. In several experiments qualitative,
individual differences among the subjects surfaced, which might be
interpreted as a hint towards the existence of individual
strategies. This would imply, that the solution of these tasks
allows for different approaches. In the tasks studied here, several
evidences from the performance as well as from it's subjective
corollaries seem to point to the involvement of higher cognitive
functions, such as pattern recognition and stream segregation, which
have not been considered in the study of ranging so far. The
subjects of this study were carrying out passive hearing tasks,
whereas ranging bats are making use of an active sensory
system. Furthermore, modifications to the stimuli were necessary for
adapting to the requirements of the human subjects. Therefore, no
attempt is made to purport that problems associated with experiments
in bats have been solved by means of our experiments once for
all. Rather, we regard our results as hypotheses, which we consider
worth for further testing with bats.",,,,,,,interesting bats vs humans study?,
Reviewing the effectiveness of music interventions in treating depression,389,"Depression is a very common mood disorder, resulting in a loss of social function, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Music interventions have been shown to be a potential alternative for depression therapy but the number of up-to-date research literature is quite limited. We present a review of original research trials which utilize music or music therapy as intervention to treat participants with depressive symptoms. Our goal was to differentiate the impact of certain therapeutic uses of music used in the various experiments. Randomized controlled study designs were preferred but also longitudinal studies were chosen to be included. 28 studies with a total number of 1,810 participants met our inclusion criteria and were finally selected. We distinguished between passive listening to music (record from a CD or live music) (79%), and active singing, playing, or improvising with instruments (46%). Within certain boundaries of variance an analysis of similar studies was attempted. Critical parameters were for example length of trial, number of sessions, participants' age, kind of music, active or passive participation and single- or group setting. In 26 studies, a statistically significant reduction in depression levels was found over time in the experimental (music intervention) group compared to a control (n = 25) or comparison group (n = 2). In particular, elderly participants showed impressive improvements when they listened to music or participated in music therapy projects. Researchers used group settings more often than individual sessions and our results indicated a slightly better outcome for those cases. Additional questionnaires about participants confidence, self-esteem or motivation, confirmed further improvements after music treatment. Consequently, the present review offers an extensive set of comparable data, observations about the range of treatment options these papers addressed, and thus might represent a valuable aid for future projects for the use of music-based interventions to improve symptoms of depression.",,,,,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01109
A job interview in the MRI scanner: How does indirectness affect addressees and overhearers?,390,"In using language, people not only exchange information, but also navigate their social world - for example, they can express themselves indirectly to avoid losing face. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated the neural correlates of interpreting face-saving indirect replies, in a situation where participants only overheard the replies as part of a conversation between two other people, as well as in a situation where the participants were directly addressed themselves. We created a fictional job interview context where indirect replies serve as a natural communicative strategy to attenuate one's shortcomings, and asked fMRI participants to either pose scripted questions and receive answers from three putative job candidates (addressee condition) or to listen to someone else interview the same candidates (overhearer condition). In both cases, the need to evaluate the candidate ensured that participants had an active interest in comprehending the replies. Relative to direct replies, face-saving indirect replies increased activation in medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyrus, in active overhearers and active addressees alike, with similar effect size, and comparable to findings obtained in an earlier passive listening study (Bašnáková et al., 2014). In contrast, indirectness effects in bilateral anterior insula and pregenual ACC, two regions implicated in emotional salience and empathy, were reliably stronger in addressees than in active overhearers. Our findings indicate that understanding face-saving indirect language requires additional cognitive perspective-taking and other discourse-relevant cognitive processing, to a comparable extent in active overhearers and addressees. Furthermore, they indicate that face-saving indirect language draws upon affective systems more in addressees than in overhearers, presumably because the addressee is the one being managed by a face-saving reply. In all, face-saving indirectness provides a window on the cognitive as well as affect-related neural systems involved in human communication.",,,,,,,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.03.030
Negative BOLD Signals During Speech Comprehension,391,"Speech comprehension studies have generally focused on the isolation and function of regions with positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals with respect to a resting baseline. Although regions with negative BOLD signals in comparison to a resting baseline have been reported in language-related tasks, their relationship to regions of positive signals is not fully appreciated. Based on the emerging notion that the negative signals may represent an active function in language tasks, we test the hypothesis that negative BOLD signals during receptive language are more associated with comprehension than content-free versions of the same stimuli. Regions associated with comprehension of speech were isolated by comparing responses to passive listening to natural speech to two incomprehensible versions of the same speech: one that was digitally time-reversed and one that was muffled by removal of high frequencies. The signal polarity was determined by comparing the BOLD signal during each speech condition to the BOLD signal during a resting baseline. As expected, stimulation-induced positive signals relative to resting baseline were observed in the canonical language areas with varying signal amplitudes for each condition. Negative BOLD responses relative to resting baseline were observed primarily in fronto-parietal regions and were specific to the natural speech condition. However, BOLD signal remained indistinguishable from baseline for the unintelligible speech conditions. Variations in connectivity between brain regions with positive and negative signals were also specifically related to the comprehension of natural speech. These observations of anticorrelated signals related to speech comprehension are consistent with emerging models of cooperative roles represented by BOLD signals of opposite polarity.",,,,,,,,
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS CAN GENERALIZE RULES and DEVELOP ABSTRACT CONCEPTS,392,"Abstract: Generalization of a rule is demonstrated if the rule governs a class of problem, and the subject, after successful experience with a limited number of problems, can apply the governing rule to new problems within that class. We show that the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is capable of such generalization for classes of problems requiting the matching of one of two alternative stimuli to a “sample” stimulus to which the animal had been previously exposed, regardless of the sensory domain used: vision, passive listening, or active echolocation. We also show this generalization capability in a related class of problem requiring a judgment of whether a single “probe” stimulus is the same as, or different from, a stimulus or stimuli previously presented. Further, one dolphin was shown capable of developing a true abstract concept of same/different through its ability to categorize pairs of simultaneously presented objects as identical or not. The suggestion that such generalization ability of dolphins may be in question because of so‐called exclusion effects is shown to be not tenable when the whole body of available data is considered.

Passive tactile recognition of geometrical shape in humans: An fMRI study,393,"Tactile shape discrimination involves frontal other than somatosensory cortex (Palva et al., 2005 [48]), but it is unclear if this frontal activity is related to exploratory concomitants. In this study, we investigated topographical details of prefrontal, premotor, and parietal areas during passive tactile recognition of 2D geometrical shapes in conditions avoiding exploratory movements. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the same wooden 2D geometrical shapes were blindly pressed on subjects' passive right palm in three conditions. In the RAW condition, shapes were pressed while subjects were asked to attend to the stimuli but were not trained to recognize them. After a brief training, in the SHAPE condition subjects were asked to covertly recognize shapes. In the RECOGNITION condition, they were asked to overtly recognize shapes, using response buttons with their opposite hand. Results showed that somatosensory cortex including contralateral SII, contralateral SI, and left insula was active in all conditions, confirming its importance in processing tactile shapes. In the RAW vs. SHAPE contrast, bilateral posterior parietal, insular, premotor, prefrontal, and (left) Broca's areas were more active in the latter. In the RECOGNITION, activation of (left) Broca's area correlated with correct responses. These results suggest that, even without exploratory movements, passive recognition of tactile geometrical shapes involves prefrontal and premotor as well as somatosensory regions. In this framework, Broca's area might be involved in a successful selection and/or execution of the correct responses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,check behavioral data,,,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2010.08.001
The TDS: A new device for comparing active and passive-guided touch,60,"A problem when comparing active and passive tactile perception of two-dimensional (2-D) stimuli is matching the active and passive tasks on all variables except the one of interest - active versus passive touch. A new computer-controlled device - the tactile display system (TDS) - has been developed to deal with this problem. The TDS tracks an ‘active’ subject’s fingertip movements during exploration of a raised line drawing and digitally records this spatio-temporal information. It then guides a passive participant’s fingertip over the same path, matching for location and speed. Any difference in performance can thus be attributed to the different conditions (active versus passive) because other variables are held constant.",51.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4ab35fdd24156c60f01cde8f07a0e878/53759c18/51.pdf),,,,No data,,"no new data, just a description of the device",https://doi.org/10.1109/86.867883
Dissociated active and passive tactile shape recognition: a case study of pure tactile apraxia,394,"Disorders of tactile object recognition (TOR) may result from primary motor or sensory deficits or higher cognitive impairment of tactile shape representations or semantic memory. Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without tactile agnosia, i.e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognition.",,,,,"no control group, just a patient",,clinical data?,10.1093/brain/124.11.2287
Optimum design of 6R passive haptic robotic arm for implant surgery,395,"The aim of this research was to design an optimum 6R passive haptic robotic arm (PHRA) to work in a limited workspace during dental implant surgery. Misplacement of an implant during dental surgery causes longer recuperation periods and functional disorders. In this study, a passive guidance robot arm was designed as a surgical aid tool for a dentist during the operation to reduce the surgical complications. Optimum design of a 6R robot is a complex issue since minimum energy has to be consumed while maximum workspace is to be achieved using optimized link lengths. The methodology used deals not only with link lengths of manipulator but also mass and inertia of the links along with the location of the tool path. Another feature of the methodology is to maximize haptic device transparency using an objective function that includes end-effector torques/forces with workspace limits taken as constraints. The objective function was obtained from dynamic equations and the constraints were defined using kinematic equations. The constrained nonlinear optimization problem was solved using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Main contribution of this paper is an optimization algorithm that considers spatial dynamics to reduce parasitic torques leading to an optimal 6R robot design. Details of the methodology, solutions, and performance of the optimization techniques are presented. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,10.1007/978-3-642-14064-8_16
Rehabilitation of Smell after Total Laryngectomy,396,"Olfactory deterioration is a major consequence of total laryngectomy that results from the permanent separation of the upper and lower airways.  Total laryngectomy not only affects the natural voice lost, but it brings about other psychosocial problems.  Leon et al.1 noted that the inability to detect smoke or other odorous danger signals can threaten the personal safety of patients after laryngectomy. Impaired olfactory function adversely impacts their quality of life, which contributes to weight loss and poor nutritional status because the ability to sense different flavors requires a functional olfactory epithelium.1 The inability to detect bodily odors can cause problems in daily life and the inability to perceive agreeable odors or fragrances can be experienced as a significant loss. Since the senses called “tastes” are dependent on retronasal stimulation of the olfactory receptors, the perception of such tastes will also be negatively influenced by the loss of the sense of smell.2 Olfaction is either a passive or active process. Passive olfaction occurs during normal nasal breathing while active processes occur during smelling and sniffing. Hilgers et al. 3 noted that total laryngectomy inevitably results in the loss of passive smelling and only a minority of patients are still able to actively smell anything. Their study of 63 laryngectomees found that about two thirds of the patients were anosmic and that the rest had difficulty in smelling.3   Tests for olfactory acuity             Different olfactory function tests for patients who underwent total laryngectomy have been developed in the Philippines and around the world over the past decades. The Jet Stream Olfactometer (JSO, Nagashima Medical Instruments Co., Japan) was developed as a modification of the T and T olfactometer (Takasago Industry, Tokyo, Japan), an olfaction test kit that includes five odorants.4 The JSO includes three of the same five odorants; odorant A- a dilution of β-phenyl ethyl alcohol, odorant B- a dilution of cyclotene and odorant C- a dilution of isovaleric acid. Concentrations of each odorant range over eight degrees of intensity. These odorants can be sprayed into the nasal cavity and stimulate the olfactory epithelium using the JSO apparatus. The detection threshold of each subject is defined as the lowest concentration detectable by the subject, whereas the recognition threshold is defined as the lowest concentration at which the odor can be identified. The subject’s olfaction levels are classified into three groups; threshold decrease by more than degree is defined as “improved”, threshold increase by more than one degree is defined as “worsened” and threshold change within ±1 degree is defined as “stable”. According to the Japan Rhinology Society, the JSO is now routinely performed in Japan.4             Another test developed by Fujii et al.4 is the Alinamin test, an intravenous olfaction test that uses Alinamin, a thiol-type derivative of Vitamin B1 that smells like garlic. A dose of 10 mg (2ml) Alinamin is injected into the median vein of the left arm at a constant rate over 20s. The latency and duration are measured. The latency interval is the time until recognition of smell while duration is the time from recognition until disappearance of the smell. The usual latency interval is 7-8 secs and the duration is 1-2 mins. In laryngectomees, the use of nasal plugs during testing prevents breathing the garlic smell from the trachea-stoma.4             Leon et al.1 also developed olfactory function tests for post laryngectomy patients which utilise their orthonasal and retronasal olfaction. Orthonasal olfaction tests include the Butanol threshold test and odor identification test using common odors developed at the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC). In the Butanol threshold test, 2 identical plastic bottles, one containing water and the other containing dilute concentration of butanol, are simultaneously presented to the subject. Subjects are instructed to occlude 1 nostril and place the tip of the bottle immediately beneath the other nostril. The bottles are then squeezed at least twice for the odorants to reach the olfactory epithelium. The subject has to choose which of the bottles contain something other than water. The odor identification test uses common household odorants like peanut butter, Ivory™ soap, mothballs, Vicks™ vaporub, chocolate, baby powder, coffee and cinnamon which are placed in opaque squeezable bottles. The odorants are delivered by squeezing the bottle underneath one nostril, while the other nostril is occluded. The subjects then choose from a printed list containing the correct items as well as an equal number of distractor items. Possible scores range from 0 to 7 items correctly identified and scores of both nostrils are averaged to arrive at the final scores. The scores from the butanol threshold test and identification tests are subsequently averaged to arrive at a composite score for the orthonasal olfactory ability.1             Retronasal olfactory function testing involves different flavoured powders applied on the tongue and then identified using a forced-choice paradigm. Twenty flavoured powders purchasable at a grocery store include garlic, strawberry, milk, lemon, orange, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, paprika, curry, butter buds, bread, cocoa, celery, chicken bouillon, grape, raspberry, onion, ginger and coffee.  A small amount of each flavoured powder is scooped up into the tip of a disposable straw and deposited on the subject’s mid-dorsal tongue. The subject chooses from a printed list of 4 items for each test. Answers are scored from 0 to 20 correct item identifications.1             Risberg-Berlin et al. used the Scandinavian Odor Identification Test (SOIT) in determining the olfactory function of post-larygectomy Swedish patients.5 The test involves 16 different odors and 4 alternative responses per odor to choose from. The smell is generated by 5 ml of odor stimulus placed in a 10 ml glass jar. The test has age and sex related cut-off scores and categorizes patients as smellers or non-smellers. Smellers are subjects diagnosed with functional hyposmia and normosmia while non-smellers are subjects diagnosed with anosmia. Ramirez et al. subjectively and objectively evaluated the olfactory function of Filipino post-laryngectomy patients using a questionnaire adapted from that of the Smell and Taste Clinic of Hospital of University Pennsylvania (HUP) and the Santo Tomas Smell Identification Test respectively.6 Each subject is asked to assess their olfactory function and the impact of such on their daily lives, including questions on olfactory disorder prior to laryngectomy, sense of smell immediately after laryngectomy, present sense of olfaction, degree of change in olfaction and smell condition after olfactory rehabilitation. Olfactory function of each subject is evaluated using the Santo Tomas Smell Identification Test (ST-SIT)7 that uses 45 odorants, each enclosed in an opaque polyethylene squeeze bottle.  Each odorant is smelled by the subject and identified from a written list of choices. The odorants have a corresponding score and the summation of these scores serves to discriminate those with normal olfactory function from those who are hyposmic and anosmic.  Based on the ST-SIT, normal individuals score more than 90; hyposmic individuals score 70 to 90 while anosmics score less than 70.   Intervention             Different techniques have been developed for improvement of olfaction in post laryngectomy patients. Schawrtz8 tried to improve smell by using a “larynx bypass,” in which airflow from the stoma is directed to the mouth, creating an artificial airflow in the nose. However, this method is troublesome and impractical for use in everyday life.8 Techniques like “glossopharyngeal press,”9 “buccopharyngeal maneuver” and “buccopharyngeal sniffing” have also been described in different olfactory rehabilitation studies.  These are less obtrusive methods that generate some degree of nasal airflow by creating volume changes in the pharynx with the mouth closed, but these are not widely applied. Hilgers2 and Ramirez et al.10 use the nasal airflow-inducing maneuver to restore nasal airflow by creating underpressure in the oral cavity and oropharynx by having the patient perform an extended yawning movement while keeping the lips securely closed and simultaneously lowering the jaw, floor of the mouth, tongue, base of tongue and soft palate. The underpressure created generates nasal airflow allowing odorant molecules to reach the olfactory epithelium. The movement is repeated rapidly several times to increase its effectiveness, but the technique requires a training period and constant use.   Conclusion             Olfactory impairment is common in patients who have undergone laryngectory. Different rehabilitation programs address the olfactory deficit of post-laryngectomy patients and aim to prevent or decrease the negative impact on quality of life that loss of olfaction brings. Aside from voice and pulmonary rehabilitation, olfactory rehabilitation should routinely be incorporated in the rehabilitation program of post-laryngectomy patients.",,,,,,,,10.32412/pjohns.v25i1.667
A case of somatopsychic depersonalization in schizotypal disorder: Insights into cognitive processing,397,"Among syndromes of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, somatopsychic depersonalization (SPD) occupies a special place as it constitutes a syndrome that comprises feelings of detachment from one's own body and mental processes. However, apart from clinical descriptions, to date the pathophysiology of SPD is not fully understood due to the rareness of the syndrome and a lack of experimental studies. In a case study of one patient with schizotypal disorder, we applied a multimodal approach (phenomenological, neuropsychological, behavioural, fMRI paradigm) in order to understanding the phenomena of SPD and specifically, cognitive processing. The patient's clinical profile was identified as disruption of implicit bodily function, accompanied by depressive symptoms. On a neuropsychological level, the patient exhibited impairment in executive functioning, intact tactile perception and kinesthetic praxis. Behavioral tests revealed an altered sense of time but unimpaired self-agency. Furthermore, the patient exhibited a lack of empathy and he had autistic traits, although with a sufficient ability to verbalize his feelings. On the neurobiological level using an active and passive touch paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found a hyperconnectivity of the default-mode network and salience network and a hypoconnectivity of the central executive brain networks in the performance of the touch task as well as intact perceptual touch processing emerging from the direct comparisons of the touch conditions. Our data provide evidence for the important role of large-brain networks in SPD that corresponds to the specific behavioural and neurocognitive phenomena.",,,,,,,,10.1111/eip.12397
PET activations during smelling of androstenone: osmics versus anosmics,398,"We used positron emission tomography to evaluate the neural correlates involved in perception of the endogenous steroid androstenone. Our aim was to investigate whether differences exist in brain activations between subjects with high sensitivity (low thresholds) for androstenone and those with a specific anosmia. We screened 87 subjects using a staircase procedure to establish individual thresholds. Twelve subjects unable to detect the steroid in its crystal form were selected for an anosmic group, and 12 subjects capable of consistently detecting a 1.4 · 10–7 M solution of androstenone comprised an osmic group. Subjects were scanned during passive smelling of phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA), pyridine, androstenone (AND) or the diluant (for baseline). Our first analysis compared brain responses of the two groups to two of these stimuli: PEA and AND versus baseline. Activations for PEA were observed in olfactory regions, including orbitofrontal and piriform cortex, in both subject groups. However, osmics and anosmics differed in their response to AND. Osmics showed more activity in the dorsomedial area of the left parietal cortex and had no significant olfactory activations, whereas anosmics showed more frontal activations in the right dorsomedial and orbitofrontal regions. The results for PEA are consistent with other studies of olfactory processing, showing activations in olfactory cortices, whereas the AND results suggest differential function in the human brain related to individual sensitivity to androstenone. Implications of the parietal lobe activations will be discussed.",,,,,,,,
Spatial constancy mechanisms in motor control,399,"The success of the human species in interacting with the environment depends on the ability to maintain spatial stability despite the continuous changes in sensory and motor inputs owing to movements of eyes, head and body. In this paper, I will review recent advances in the understanding of how the brain deals with the dynamic flow of sensory and motor information in order to maintain spatial constancy of movement goals. The first part summarizes studies in the saccadic system, showing that spatial constancy is governed by a dynamic feed-forward process, by gaze-centred remapping of target representations in anticipation of and across eye movements. The subsequent sections relate to other oculomotor behaviour, such as eye-head gaze shifts, smooth pursuit and vergence eye movements, and their implications for feed-forward mechanisms for spatial constancy. Work that studied the geometric complexities in spatial constancy and saccadic guidance across head and body movements, distinguishing between self-generated and passively induced motion, indicates that both feed-forward and sensory feedback processing play a role in spatial updating of movement goals. The paper ends with a discussion of the behavioural mechanisms of spatial constancy for arm motor control and their physiological implications for the brain. Taken together, the emerging picture is that the brain computes an evolving representation of three-dimensional action space, whose internal metric is updated in a nonlinear way, by optimally integrating noisy and ambiguous afferent and efferent signals.

Perceptions of movement patterns: Recall of movement,400,"The present study attempted to characterize the perception, retention, and recall of kinaesthetic information regarding movement sequences (patterns). An attempt was made to draw on and extend conclusions relevant to simple movements (movement amplitude). One group of 10 blindfolded subjects recalled criterion movement patterns that had been actively commanded and 10 subjects recalled passively induced movements. The following conclusions were made. (1) Previous reports of algebraic errors in the recall of simple movement amplitudes are consistent with the finding that criterion perimeter, area, and depth of features were underestimated when recalled. (2) Measures of the accuracy of kinaesthetic perception do not alone account for the generally low level of pattern recall, the large range of individual differences or the underestimation of amplitude. The process of percept formation and of translating a percept into recalled movement are implicated. (3) Conclusions based on the short-term retention and recall of simple movement do not account for the coding, retention, and recall of movement sequences (patterns). (4) Percepts were formed, and patterns were recalled as a sequence of features but not as a sequence of key positions. (5) No direct difference was demonstrated between the recall of actively commanded and passively induced criterion movement patterns. However, the finding of a high gross angle change in the active condition was explained in terms of an unfavourable interaction between corollary discharge and sensory information.",,,,,,,,10.2466/pms.1978.47.1.287
An electromyographic protocol that distinguishes spasticity from dystonia,401,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this proof of concept study is to demonstrate that electromyographic (EMG) activation patterns of leg muscles differ predictably among patients with predominantly spasticity, patients with predominantly dystonia, and typically developing control subjects during rest, volitional movement, and passively induced movement. METHODS: Eight control subjects, 6 subjects with dystonia, and 7 subjects with spasticity were recruited, ages 6-25 years. Surface EMG sensors were applied over 4 muscle groups of each leg. EMG recordings and video were obtained during rest, quick stretch, and volitional movement. The number of muscles active during 3 resting, 4 quick stretch, and 8 volitional movement items were averaged and compared across subject groups. RESULTS: Control subjects showed minimal numbers of muscles active during resting, quick stretch, or volitional movement activities. Spastic subjects showed multiple muscles responding with high amplitude to quick stretch but not to volitional movement activities. Dystonic subjects showed multiple muscles responding to volitional movement activities but not to quick stretch. Analysis with a Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant differences between the three groups in numbers of muscles activated during quick stretch activities (p = 0.017) and volitional movement activities (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: EMG data collected with this protocol may be useful for distinguishing spastic from dystonic hypertonia.",,,,,,,,10.3233/PRM-160373
An fMRI study of the interactions between the attention and the gustatory networks,402,"In a prior study, we showed that trying to detect a taste in a tasteless solution results in enhanced activity in the gustatory and attention networks. The aim of the current study was to use connectivity analyses to test if and how these networks interact during directed attention to taste. We predicted that the attention network modulates taste cortex, reflecting top-down enhancement of incoming sensory signals that are relevant to goal-directed behavior. fMRI was used to measure brain responses in 14 subjects as they performed two different tasks: (1) trying to detect a taste in a solution or (2) passively perceiving the same solution. We used psychophysiological interaction analysis to identify regions demonstrating increased connectivity during a taste attention task compared to passive tasting. We observed greater connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and parietal operculum and between the anterior cingulate cortex and the right anterior insula and frontal operculum. These results suggested that selective attention to taste is mediated by a hierarchical circuit in which signals are first sent from the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and parietal operculum to the anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn modulates responses in the anterior insula and frontal operculum. We then tested this prediction using dynamic causal modeling. This analysis confirmed a model of indirect modulation of the gustatory cortex, with the strongest influence coming from the frontal eye fields via the anterior cingulate cortex. In summary, the results indicate that the attention network modulates the gustatory cortex during attention to taste and that the anterior cingulate cortex acts as an intermediary processing hub between the attention network and the gustatory cortex. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.",,,,,behavioral data?,,,10.1007/s12078-012-9122-z
Collision Avoidance Affected by Walker's Head Direction in a Virtual Environment,403,"We investigated participants' active response to avoid collision with an approaching walker in a virtual environment. The walker was approaching and then changed his direction leftward or rightward at a random timing. The walker's head rotated (yaw) leftward or rightward, or remained straight at 533ms before direction change of walking. Ten participants were asked to avoid collision by moving a mouse laterally to move own viewpoint. We found that participants' collision avoidance behavior was affected by head directions. They moved in the opposite direction to the other walker's head direction when the walker rotated his head. These results suggest that we utilize other people's head direction to avoid collision in active situation as well as static perceptual situation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,,10.1007/978-3-642-39476-8_146
Recovery from adaptation for dynamic and static motion aftereffects: Evidence for two mechanisms,404,"The motion aftereffect (MAE) is an illusory drift of a physically stationary pattern induced by prolonged viewing of a moving pattern. Depending on the nature of the test pattern the MAE can be phenomenally different. This difference in appearance has led to the suggestion that different underlying mechanisms may be responsible and several reports show that this might be the case. Here, we tested whether differences in MAE duration obtained with stationary test patterns and dynamic test pa tterns can be explained by a single underlying mechanism. We find the results support the existence of (at least) two mechanisms. The two mechanisms show different characteristics: the static MAE (i.e. the MAE tested with a static test pattern) is almost completely stored when the static test is preceded by a dynamic test; in contradistinction, the dynamic MAE is not stored when dynamic testing is preceded by a static test pattern.",,,,,,,,10.1016/0042-6989(95)00111-5

Discussion on geological science big data and its applications,406,"The geological big data is a kind of spatio-temporal big data whose characteristics has both similarities and marked differences with the general big data. Due to long-term evolution of geological objects with huge space and influence of various geological process, its development undergoes a complicated process. Geological bodies are buried in deep underground so that geological data has the feature of incomplete information of parameter, structure, relationship and evolution, which has high computation complexity with high dimension and significant uncertainty. In order to address those challenges, the theories, methods and techniques of big data should be introduced to integrate and utilize geological science big data. It is necessary to set up unified spatial reference system for geological spatio-temporal big data to realize data consistency processing and fusion with regards to spatial standard benchmark, tense, scale and semantics. Various kinds of integrated storage and management methods for static geological exploration data and dynamic distributed geological observation data will be developed. On the one hand, current big data techniques can be adapted, such as realtime data storage and management, big data storage and management architecture, and analysis and processing architecture. On the other hand, specialized big data techniques based on actual situation should be developed, such as distributed parallel spatio-temporal indexing for geological data, and pre-dispatch method considering spatiotemporal relationship and geological semantics. To judge a traditional algorithm whether is suitable for being transformed into big data environment, main criteria include algorithm task decomposability, data decomposability and data flow segmented relevance. Hence, the transformation of traditional geological data processing methods will be from these three aspects to excavate the task parallelism, geometry decomposability and reduce the data flow segmented relevance as much as possible to adapt to the distributed computing and high performance computing of big data environment. The big data technique, which may be a breakthrough in geological science, can mine knowledge from massive spatio-temporal and text data directly in spite of the limits in geological sampling methods such as the randomness and sparsity of sample space, the judge relied on inadequate observational data and fixed mode, and traditional data analysis methods. A series of mathematical geology methods and spatial data mining methods which are frequently used nowadays can be used in geological spatio-temporal big data mining after being remolded. The key science and technology issues referred in geological science development in big data era can be listed as follows-the integrated storage management and handling of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, big and small data, hybrid and precision data, model and data, static exploration model and dynamic monitoring model, the combination of data mining and data analysis, the unification of correlation and causality, deep mining and visualization of geological science big data, and so on. Taking metal mineral metallogenic prediction as an example, geological big data utilization and analysis are studied. In terms of a global view, Glass Earth is the underground extention of Digital Earth. Glass Earth is a kind of 3D visualized virtual shallow crust, which is an aggregation of geological and geographical information and stored on the computer network to be accessed by multi-user and provide analysis service and decision making to the research and applications of geology, resources and environment. The Glass Earth is the effective vehicle of geological science big data and the construction of the Glass Earth is one of the best ways to solve all the aforementioned scientific and technical problems.",,,,,,,,10.1360/N972015-01035
"Effects Of Muscular Strength, Exercise Order, And Acute Whole-body Vibration Exposure On Bat Swing Velocity",407,"The purposes for this study were to investigate effects of acute whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure and exercise order on bat speed and to examine relationship between muscular strength and bat speed. All participants were recreationally trained men (n = 16; 22 ± 2 years; 181.4 ± 7.4 cm; 84.7 ± 9 kg), with previous baseball experience and were tested for 1 repetitive maximum (1RM) strength in squat and bench press. Subjects then participated in 4 randomized sessions on separate days, each consisting of 3 sets of 5 bat swings. Exercises (upper and lower body dynamic and static movements related to bat swing) with or without WBV exposure were performed after sets 1 and 2. Trials were as follows: no-exercise Control (CTRL), upper body followed by lower body exercises without WBV (Arm-Leg NOVIB), upper body followed by lower body exercises with WBV (Arm-Leg VIB), and lower body followed by upper body exercises with WBV (Leg-Arm VIB). Bat speed was recorded during each swing and averaged across sets. Statistical analyses were performed to assess differences across sets and trials. Linear regressions analyzed relationship between strength and bat speed. A significant relationship existed between bat speed and lower body strength (r2 = 0.406, p = 0.008) but not for upper body strength. The exercise order of Arm-Leg VIB significantly increased bat speed by 2.6% (p = 0.02). Performing identical order of exercises without vibration (Arm-Leg NOVIB) significantly decreased bat speed by 2% (p = 0.039). It was concluded that adding vibration exposure to total-body exercises can provide acute enhancements in bat speed.

Accelerating optimization-based haptic rendering by parallel quadratic programming method,408,"It is a challenging problem to achieve fast and realistic six degree-of-freedom (DOF) haptic simulation of scenarios involving large number of multi-region contacts. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based constrained method enhanced by parallel quadratic programming to solve the rendering problem. Hierarchical sphere-tree models are used to represent the moving haptic tool and its surrounding static objects. Given a moving graphic tool as the avatar of the haptic tool in the virtual environment, we compute its quasi-static motion by solving a configuration-based optimization. Instead of using traditional active-set method, we transform the original optimization problem into its dual problem and solve the optimum about the graphic tool using a parallel quadratic programming method. Our algorithm has been implemented with a 6-DoF Phantom Premium 3.0. We validate the proposed algorithm in several benchmarks involving complex, large-region contacts. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a two to three times speed improvement than the active-set method. A further speed-up for haptic rendering may be achieved by the parallel implementation on parallel processor such as graphic processing units. © 2013 IEEE.",,,,,,,,10.1109/IROS.2013.6697003
Simulation of motor cortex connectivity in different states,409,"An understanding of the connectivity changes in cerebral networks following stroke will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic techniques that are based on neurobiological principles and will allow the delivery of specific therapies to appropriately targeted patients suffering from stroke. Motor cortex network was represented as a directed graph and it was implemented as a dynamic system in order to study the mechanisms of impairment and recovery. Complexity was used to express the extent to which a system was both functionally segregated and functionally integrated. Motor cortex network was optimized by pattern search to investigate the change of connectivity in static, movement and stroke state. The simulation results show that motor areas have stronger connections in movement state. The connection strength decreases in stroke, which depends on disconnection mode. The inter-hemisphere connections are stronger and self-connections are weaker than other connections in the movement and stroke states. The investigation indicates the model can reflect the connectivity variation or plasticity of cerebral motor cortex qualitatively according to clinical trials.",,,,,,,,
Towards a Better Future,410,"and Introduction Abstract Scientific evidence supporting a role for faulty scapular positioning in patients with various shoulder disorders is cumulating. Clinicians who manage patients with shoulder pain and athletes at risk of developing shoulder pain need to have the skills to assess static and dynamic scapular positioning and dynamic control. Several methods for the assessment of scapular positioning are described in scientific literature. However, the majority uses expensive and specialised equipment (laboratory methods), making their use in clinical practice nearly impossible. On the basis of biometric and kinematic studies, guidelines for interpreting the observation of static and dynamic scapular positioning pattern in patients with shoulder pain are provided. At this point, clinicians can use reliable clinical tests for the assessment of both static and dynamic scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. However, this review also provides clinicians several possible pitfalls when performing clinical scapular evaluation. On the basis of its clinical relevance, its proven reliability, its relation to body length and its applicability in a clinical setting, this review recommends to assess the scapula both static (visual observation and acromial distance or Baylor/double square method for shoulder protraction) and semidynamic (visual observation and inclinometry for scapular upward rotation). In addition, when the patient demonstrates with shoulder impingement symptoms, the scapular repositioning test and scapular assistant test are recommended for relating the patients' symptoms to the position or movement of the scapula.",,,,,,,,10.2307/j.ctv5cg83z.13
A virtual geographical environment based temporal information visualization system for ecological restoration in dump area,411,"The problem of time is the basic task in ecological restoration. Spatial information has stronger temporal character along with the development of spatial technology and modern information infrastructure. The traditional visual modeling method has been unable to meet useś requirements flexibility. This paper introduces a method of modeling using the coupling of temporal information and static visual model that can be used to solve the problems that geography process modeling was united little with the object modeling, and uses the interpolation algorithm to generate the confined Delaunay triangulation net and build up the accurate dump DEM which is the base of the modeling. On the basis of Quick Bird data in recent years, the dynamic display of temporal information of ecological restoration in dump area is realized by the Multigen Creator/Vega Software finally.© 2013 American Scientific Publishers.

"Layers, warps, and alpha maps in mid-level vision",412,"Purpose: The notion of dividing in age data into overlapping layers is useful in many fields, including visual perception, video compositing, and computer vision. In computer graphics an alpha map is often provided in register with an RGB image indicating pointwise transparency, and determining the way a given layer interacts with layers beneath. Method: By combining ideas from these sources with concepts from motion analysis we have devised a powerful mid-level representation for human and machine vision. A given layer consists of a set of registered 2-D maps that may move and distort together. The main maps in each layer are: an intensity map, indicating the intensity (or color) of each point; an alpha map, indicating the transparency at each point; and a warp map, indicating how the each point moves over time. Results: In static vision the alpha map formalism is equivalent to Metelli's episcotister model, and offers a convenient format for representing transparency, occlusion, and amodal completion. In motion, the alpha map and the warp map together allow one to handle dynamic occlusion and motion transparency in natural ways. Historically, optic flow models have dealt with occlusion boundaries by introducing clumsy discontinuities in the flow field. With the layered representation the flow in each layer becomes quite smooth; the discontinuities are assigned to the alpha map, where they belong. This approach leads to better motion analysis and is consistent with human phenomenology. Conclusions: Layered representations that incorporate multiple registered maps are widely useful, and it is reasonble to propose that they form a fundamental part of the human visual system's internal vocabulary. In particular, we find that motion analysis is greatly improved within this framework.",,,,,,,,
Gaze Stabilization Test Asymmetry Score as an Indicator of Previous Concussion in a Cohort of Collegiate Football Players,413,"Objective: Vestibular dysfunction may lead to decreased visual acuity with head movements, which may impede athletic performance and result in injury. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that athletes with history of concussion would have differences in gaze stabilization test (GST) as compared with those without a history of concussion. Design: Cross-sectional, descriptive. Setting: University Athletic Medicine Facility. Participants: Fifteen collegiate football players with a history of concussion, 25 collegiate football players without a history of concussion. Intervention: Participants completed the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), static visual acuity, perception time test, active yaw plane GST, stability evaluation test (SET), and a bedside oculomotor examination. Main Outcome Measures: Independent samples t test was used to compare GST, SET, and DHI scores per group, with Bonferroni-adjusted alpha at P < 0.01. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the clinical performance of the GST and SET. Results: Athletes with previous concussion had a larger GST asymmetry score [mean (M) = 12.40, SD = 9.09] than those without concussion (M = 4.92, SD = 4.67; t (18.70) = -2.955, P = 0.008, 95% CI, -12.79 to -2.18, d = -1.37). Clinical performance of the GST (AUC = 0.77) was better than the SET (AUC = 0.61). Conclusions: Results suggest peripheral vestibular or vestibular-visual interaction deficits in collegiate athletes with a history of concussion. The results support further research on the use of GST for sport-related concussion evaluation and monitoring. Clinical Relevance: Inclusion of objective vestibular tests in the concussion protocol may reveal the presence of peripheral vestibular or visual-vestibular deficits. Therefore, the GST may add an important perspective on the effects of concussion.",,,,,,,,10.1097/JSM.0000000000000138
Biomechanical mapping of the female pelvic floor before and after prolapse surgery,414,"Introduction: Recently, the AUGS scientific community completed a survey to identify the highest priority research questions pertaining to pathophysiology and treatments of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Mechanistic research on pelvic supportive structures, clinical trials to optimize outcomes after POP surgery and evidence-based quality measures for POP outcomes were identified among the major focus areas [1]. An innovative approach, Vaginal Tactile Imaging (VTI), allows biomechanical mapping of the female pelvic floor including assessment of tissue elasticity and measurement of pelvic muscles strength which are affected in POP [2]. Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to explore outcome of POP surgeries with the VTI by characterizing biomechanical restoration of pelvic floor conditions, identifying changes of pelvic floor support structures and their significance, and investigating changes of pelvic muscle contractive capabilities. Method(s): The examined POP surgeries set included adnexectomy, colpopexy suspension, colporrhaphy, enterocele repair, hemorrhoidectomy, hysterectomy, iliococcygeal suspension, posterioir repair, sacrocolpopexy, salpingectomy, salpingo oophorectomy, and uterosacral suspension. AVaginal Tactile Imaging probe with 96 pressure sensors and motion tracking system was used to acquire a high definition pressure feedback from two opposite sides along the entire vagina before and 4+ months after the POP surgery. The VTI measurements were completed at rest with manually applied deflection pressures to vaginal walls and with pelvic muscle voluntary and involuntary contractions (cough), relaxation, and Valsalva maneuver. Result(s): The study was designed with 125 subjects that underwent VTI scans before and after pelvic floor surgery at five clinical sites. VTI examination data per every subject were recorded as quantitative biomechanical static (tactile imaging) and dynamic (functional) maps. Comparative analytical tool was developed to identify changes in pelvic passive ligamentous structures (pubourethral, arcus tendineus, cardinal, uterosacral, perineal) and muscles (puborectalis, pubococcygeus, pubovaginal, puboperineal, levator plate, ilicoccygeal) after the surgery. An interpretation of the acquired VTI data for POP conditions was proposed based on the biomechanical assessment of the functional anatomy before and after surgical repair. Further analysis with recently developed software will soon enable examination of critical pelvic tissue modifications with statistic confidence intervals. Conclusion(s): This study represents the largest set of pelvic biomechanical data collected prospectively before and after surgery in a multi-center study design, with a wide range of patient demographics, geographic regions and surgical approaches observed. The VTI recorded the biomechanical transformation of pelvic floor tissues and support structures for the individual pelvic floor conditions and interventions. The biomechanical maps collected before and after the surgery could aid in assessment and evaluation of the outcome across varied demographics and procedures.",,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00192-018-3752-x
An electromechanical model of the middle ear,415,"A dynamic model of the middle ear and mastoid system was designed in order to evaluate basic principles in tympanometry. The model allows controlled simulation of the exact changes in the ear drum's mass and in intratympanic volume and pressure. The contribution of each of these factors to acoustic impedance was measured. We found that the volume values of static, acoustic compliance were equal to the volume of air in a closed cell. There was good correlation between direct measurement of air pressure in the model cell and indirect pressure measurement by tympanometry. We also demonstrated a difference between mechanical displacement of the drum and its displacement by negative pressure. This demonstration of tympanometry using a middle-ear compatible model enables us to understand its principles and helps in the education of students.",,,,,,,,

Towards the improvement of automatic speech recognition by integrating dynamic and static auditory-based acoustic distinctive features and spectral cues,417,"In this paper, we investigate the addition of the time derivatives of the auditory-based acoustic distinctive features and spectral cues to their static values for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Comparative experiments have indicated that combining the classical MFCCs with the instantaneous and the dynamic features of the speech signal represented by both the auditory-based acoustic distinctive cues and spectral cues using a multi-stream paradigm leads to an improvement in the recognition performance. To test the use of the new multi-stream feature vector, a series of experiments on speaker-independent continuous-speech recognition have been carried out using the TIMIT database. Using such paradigm, we found that the use of the proposed static and dynamic features combined with MFCCs, outperforms the conventional recognition process that uses only the MFCCs and their first and second derivatives.",,,,,,,,
Interpersonal touch interventions for patients in intensive care: A design‐oriented realist review,418,"Aim: To develop a theoretical framework to inform the design of interpersonal touch interventions intended to reduce stress in adult intensive care unit patients.; Design: Realist review with an intervention design-oriented approach.; Methods: We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and grey literature sources without date restrictions. Subject experts suggested additional articles. Evidence synthesis drew on diverse sources of literature and was conducted iteratively with theory testing. We consulted stakeholders to focus the review. We performed systematic searches to corroborate our developing theoretical framework.; Results: We present a theoretical framework based around six intervention construction principles. Theory testing provided some evidence in favour of treatment repetition, dynamic over static touch and lightening sedation. A lack of empirical evidence was identified for construction principles relating to intensity and positive/negative evaluation of emotional experience, moderate pressure touch for sedated patients and intervention delivery by relatives versus healthcare practitioners.; ",,,,,,,,10.1002/nop2.200
한성준류 태평무 터벌림 과장의 호흡유형과 특성 연구 TT  - A Study on Breathing Patterns and Features in a Han Sungjun Style of Taepyeogmu Dance Episode Tubullim,419,"[호흡은 춤 동작에 생명력을 불어 넣어 주는 원천적인 요소로서 충의 내적, 외적 흐름을 결정지어 주는 가장 중요한 요인이 된다. 또한 이 호흡과 충의 동작은 서로 떼어 놓고 생각 할 수 없을 만큼 불가분의 관계를 지닌다. 그러므로 본 연구에서는 한성준(韓成俊) 류 (類) 태평무(太平舞) 터벌림 과장 춤사위의 호흡구조 분석을 통하여 그 유형과 그에 따른 특성을 추출하여 알아봄으로써 이 춤을 보다 과학적이고도 객관적으로 분석, 그 실체를 파악해 보고자 하였다. 그 결과 다음과 같은 결론에 도달했다.  첫째, 태평무 터벌림 과장의 호흡구조를 들숨, 날숨, 멈춤의 호흡표기법에 의해 분석해 본 결과, 10박 1호흡(회)과 10박 2호흡(회), 그리고 10박 3호흡(회)과 10박 4호 흡(회)으로 구성되어 있음을 알 수 있었다.  둘째, 터벌림 과장에서 들숨 • 날숨 • 멈춤이 차지하고 있는 비율을 살펴보았을 때, 들 숨 75회와 날숨 81회, 그리고 멈춤 12회로 들숨보다 날숨이 다소 많은 것으로 나타났다. 여기에서 들숨과 날숨의 다양한 변화는 터벌림 춤사위의 기교적인 측면이 부각되었다고 볼 때 이는 멈춤 호흡의 정적인 멋과 더불어 그 역동성이 강조되는 춤을 이루는 원천이 되었다고 할 수 있다.  셋째, 터벌림의 호흡유형을 추출하여 분석해본 결과 큰호홉과 중간호홉 그리고 작은호 홉이 다양하게 구성되어 있다. 그러나 그 호흡의 기교에 따라 들숨과 날숨이 대칭을 이루는 호흡선 뿐만 아니라 멈춤을 나타내는 수직선 부호로 인하여 비대칭형의 변형된 호흡선의 두 가지 양상으로 나타났다.  넷째, 터벌림 춤사위의 호흡유형과 연관하여 특성을 분석해 정리해 본다면, 길고 깊은 호흡으로 시작하여 점진적으로 빨라지면서 짧고 얕은 호흡으로 맺음과 어름 그리고 풀음 기법에 의한 점一선一원의 호흡선으로 이어져 필체 • 학체 • 궁체의 춤사위가 되었다. 특히, 이때의 춤에서는 학체와 궁체의 춤사위가 주를 이루어 매우 부드러우면서 기교적이고 역동적인 춤사위를 드러냈다., As the original element of providing vitality to dancing motion, breathing becomes the most important factor of determining the internal and external flows of dancing. Also, it has an inseparable relation with the motion. Thus, this study tried to analyze the breathing structure of a Han, Sungjun style of Taepyeongmu (Peace Dance) motion, extract breathing patterns and features from the analysis and explore them, analyze the dance more scientifically and objectively and understand its substance. If 1 say the result here first, it can be summarized as follows.  First, analyzing the breathing structure of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim by the breathing notation of inhalation, exhalation and stop showed that Episode Tubullim one breath(twice), two breaths(four times), three breaths(eight times) and four breaths(nine times) of tenfold time.  Secondly, exploring the percentages accounted for by Episode Tubullim Quantifying them in detail showed that inhalation appeared 75 tines, exhalation 81 times and stop 12 times. In particular, the various changes of inhalation and exhalation here revealing the technical aspects of Taepyeongmu dance motion highlighted indicated that they became the origin for the dance whose dynamicity is emphasized together with the static taste of stop breathing.  Thirdly, extracting and analyzing the breathing pattern of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim showed that most of Episode Tubullim consisted variously of big, middle and small breaths. But not only a breath line of symmetrical inhalation and exhalation according to the techniques of the breaths but also a vertical sign expressive of stop caused two aspects of asymmetrical transformed breath lines.  Fourthly, analyzing and arranging the episode-specific feature of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim in connection with the breathing pattern of its motion showed that Episode Tubullim had bow-shaped, crane-shaped, and brush-shaped dancing motions from long and deep breaths through short and shallow breaths with progressive speed to breath lines of dot, line and circle by the techniques of fastening, tightrope dancing and unfastening.  In particular, crane-shaped and bow-shaped dancing motions which were very soft, technical and dynamic formed the mainstream of the dance at that time. Also, they showed Korean static, middle and dynamic feature with outstanding internal breathing technique by adding stop breathing between]",,,,,,,,
