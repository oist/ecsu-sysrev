1,Early vestibular processing does not discriminate active from passive self-motion if there is a discrepancy between predicted and actual proprioceptive feedback,"Most of our sensory experiences are gained by active exploration of the world. While the ability to distinguish sensory inputs resulting of our own actions (termed reafference) from those produced externally (termed exafference) is well established, the neural mechanisms underlying this distinction are not fully understood. We have previously proposed that vestibular signals arising from self-generated movements are inhibited by a mechanism that compares the internal prediction of the proprioceptive consequences of self-motion to the actual feedback. Here we directly tested this proposal by recording from single neurons in monkey during vestibular stimulation that was externally produced and/or self-generated. We show for the first time that vestibular reafference is equivalently canceled for self-generated sensory stimulation produced by activation of the neck musculature (head-on-body motion), or axial musculature (combined head and body motion), when there is no discrepancy between the predicted and actual proprioceptive consequences of self-motion. However, if a discrepancy does exist, central vestibular neurons no longer preferentially encode vestibular exafference. Specifically, when simultaneous active and passive motion resulted in activation of the same muscle proprioceptors, neurons robustly encoded the total vestibular input (i.e., responses to vestibular reafference and exafference were equally strong), rather than exafference alone. Taken together, our results show that the cancellation of vestibular reafference in early vestibular processing requires an explicit match between expected and actual proprioceptive feedback. We propose that this vital neuronal computation, necessary for both accurate sensory perception and motor control, has important implications for a variety of sensory systems that suppress self-generated signals. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.",REJECTED,6,,
2,A comparison of two methods for the training of spatial cognition,"Compared 2 methods of teaching the difference between right and left to 18 preschool children. A group of 6 children received active, movement-oriented training; a 2nd group of 6 received passive visual-oriented training; and a 3rd group received no training. Dependent measures of the knowledge of right and left were taken before the training, immediately after training, and 2 wks afterward. The dependent measures varied in the level of required abstraction. Both movement and visual training enhanced performance, but the movement-oriented training was significantly more effective on less abstract tests of spatial knowledge.

3,Active versus passive touch: Factors influencing the transmission of somatosensory signals to primary sornatosensory cortex,"Active and passive touch, respectively with and without voluntary movement on the part of the subject, are frequently reported to be equivalent in terms of the resultant perceptual abilities. This review reexamines the notion of perceptual equivalence in the light of growing evidence that the transmission of tactile inputs is diminished, or 'gated,' during the Course of active movement. It is concluded that there is indeed gating of cutaneous inputs during active touch. In most experiments, the paradoxical observation of perceptual equivalence between active and passive touch can partly be explained by the choice of task, namely, tactile discriminations that depend on relative, and not absolute, differences in inputs. The surprising lack of evidence for any superiority of passive touch over active touch can likely be explained by several factors. First, performance with active touch may be enhanced by the motor strategy, e.g., by reducing the speed; of movement at critical points, and so reducing the degree of gating, and (or) by optimally orienting the exploring digits so as to bring the most sensitive skin areas into contact with the object in question. Second, central influences, including attention and motor set, may be specifically activated during voluntary movement and contribute to enhancing performance during active touch. Thus, the gating influences associated with active touch may be offset, partly or wholly, by the combined influence of these factors to yield (near) perceptual equivalence for active and passive touch.",REJECTED,4,,
4,Stretch-reflex threshold modulation during active elbow movements in post-stroke survivors with spasticity,"Objectives Voluntary movements post-stroke are affected by abnormal muscle activation due to exaggerated stretch reflexes (SRs). We examined the ability of post-stroke subjects to regulate SRs in spastic muscles. Methods Elbow flexor and extensor EMGs and joint angle were recorded in 13 subjects with chronic post-stroke spasticity. Muscles were either stretched passively (relaxed arm) or actively (antagonist contraction) at different velocities. Velocity-dependent SR thresholds were defined as angles where stretched muscle EMG exceeded 3SDs of baseline. Sensitivity of SRs to stretch velocity was defined as µ. The regression through thresholds was interpolated to zero velocity to obtain the tonic SR threshold (TSRT) angle. Results Compared to passive stretches, TSRTs during active motion occurred at longer muscle lengths (i.e., increased in flexors and decreased in extensors by 10–40°). Values of μ increased by 1.5–4.0. Changes in flexor TSRTs during active compared to passive stretches were correlated with clinical spasticity (r = −0.68) and arm motor impairment (r = 0.81). Conclusions Spasticity thresholds measured at rest were modulated during active movement. Arm motor impairments were related to the ability to modulate SR thresholds between the two states rather than to passive-state values. Significance Relationship between spasticity and movement disorders may be explained by deficits in SR threshold range of regulation and modifiability, representing a measure of stroke-related sensorimotor deficits.",REJECTED,6,,
5,Cognitive load can explain differences in active and passive touch,"Active touch is often described as yielding ""better-quality"" information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",ACCEPTED,,,
6,"Bouncing between model and data: Stability, passivity, and optimality in hybrid dynamics","Rhythmically bouncing a ball with a racket is a seemingly simple task, but it poses all the challenges critical for coordinative behavior: perceiving the ball's trajectory to adapt position and velocity of the racket for the next ball contact. To gain insight into the underlying control strategies, the authors conducted a series of studies that tested models with experimental data, with an emphasis on deriving model-based hypotheses and trying to falsify them. Starting with a simple dynamical model of the racket and ball interactions, stability analyses showed that open-loop dynamics affords dynamical stability, such that small perturbations do not require corrections. To obtain this passive stability, the ball has to be impacted with negative accelerationa strategy that subjects adopted in a variety of conditions at steady state. However, experimental tests that applied perturbations revealed that after perturbations, subjects applied active perceptually guided corrections to reestablish steady state faster than by relying on the passive model's relaxation alone. Hence, the authors derived a model with active control based on optimality principles that considered each impact as a separate reaching-like movement. This model captured some additional features of the racket trajectory but failed to predict more fine-grained aspects of performance. The authors proceed to present a new model that accounts not only for fine-grained behavior but also reconciles passive and active control approaches with new predictions that will be put to test in the next set of experiments.

7,Passive and active discrimination of natural frequency of virtual dynamic systems,"It has been shown that humans use combined feedforward and feedback control strategies when manipulating external dynamic systems and when exciting virtual dynamic systems at resonance and that they can tune their control parameters in response to changing natural frequencies. We present a study to determine the discrimination thresholds for the natural frequency of such resonant dynamic systems. Weber fractions (WF, %) are reported for the discrimination of 1, 2, 4, and 8 Hz natural frequencies. Participants were instructed either to passively perceive or actively excite the virtual system via a one degree-of-freedom haptic interface with visual and/or haptic feedback. The average WF for natural frequency ranged from 4% to 8.5% for 1, 2, and 4 Hz reference natural frequencies, while the WF was approximately 20% for systems with a reference natural frequency of 8 Hz. Results indicate that sensory feedback modality has a significant effect on WF during passive perception, but no significant effect in the active perception case. The data also suggest that discrimination sensitivity is not significantly affected by excitation mode. Finally, results for systems with equivalent natural frequencies but different spring stiffness indicate that participants do not discriminate natural frequency based on the maximum force magnitude perceived. © 2010 IEEE.",ACCEPTED,,,
8,Active force perception depends on cerebellar function,"Damage to the cerebellum causes characteristic movement abnormalities but is thought to have minimal impact on somatosensory perception. Traditional clinical assessments of patients with cerebellar lesions reveal no perceptual deficits despite the fact that the cerebellum receives substantial somatosensory information. Given that abnormalities have been reported in predicting the visual consequences of movement, we suspect that the cerebellum broadly participates in perception when motor output is required (i.e., active perception). Thus we hypothesize that cerebellar integrity is essential for somatosensory perception that requires motor activity, but not passive somatosensory perception. We compared the perceptual acuity of human cerebellar patients to that of healthy control subjects in several different somatosensory perception tasks with minimal visual information. We found that patients were worse at active force and stiffness discrimination but similar to control subjects with regard to passive cutaneous force detection, passive proprioceptive detection, and passive proprioceptive discrimination. Furthermore, the severity of movement symptoms as assessed by a clinical exam was positively correlated with impairment of active force perception. Notably, within the context of these perceptual tasks, control subjects and cerebellar patients displayed similar movement characteristics, and hence differing movement strategies are unlikely to underlie the differences in perception. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is vital to sensory prediction of self-generated movement and suggest a general role for the cerebellum in multiple forms of active perception. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.",ACCEPTED,,,
9,Repetitive TMS of the somatosensory cortex improves writer ’ s cramp and improves writer ' s cramp and enhances cortical,"OBJECTIVE: Since the somatosensory system is believed to be affected in focal dystonia, we focused on the modulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to improve symptoms of writer’s cramp. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with writer’s cramp (N=9 in the pilot study and N=11 in the advanced study) were treated with 30-minute 1 Hz real- or sham- rTMS of the SI cortex every day for 5 days. Before and after rTMS, 1.5 T fMRI was examined during simple hand movements. While in the pilot study the rTMS coil was navigated over the SI cortex with a maximum of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal induced by passive movement, patients in the advanced study had the coil above the postcentral sulcus. RESULTS: After real-rTMS, 4 pilot study patients and 10 advanced study patients experienced subjective and objective improvement in writing, while only minimal changes were observed after sham-rTMS. Patients involved in the active move- ment task exhibited a rTMS-induced BOLD signal increase bilaterally in the SI cortex, posterior parietal cortex and in the supplementary motor area (p<0.001 corrected). After sham-rTMS, no BOLD signal changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1 Hz rTMS of the SI cortex can improve writer’s cramp while increasing the cortical activity in both hemispheres. Handwriting improved in most patients, as well as the subjective benefit, and lasted for 2–3 weeks. The ben- eficial effects of rTMS paralleled the functional reorganization in the SI cortex and connected areas, reflecting the impact of somatosensory system on active motion control.

10,Active visual object exploration and recognition with an unmanned aerial vehicle,"In this paper, an active control method for visual object exploration and recognition with an unmanned aerial vehicle is presented. This work uses a convolutional neural network for visual object recognition, where input images are obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle from multiple objects. The object recognition task is an iterative process actively controlled by a saliency map module, which extracts interesting object regions for exploration. The active control allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to autonomously explore better object regions to improve the recognition accuracy. The iterative exploration task stops when the probability from the convolutional neural network exceeds a decision threshold. The active control is validated with offline and real-time experiments for visual exploration and recognition of five objects. Furthermore, passive exploration is also tested for performance comparison. Experiments show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable to autonomously explore interesting object regions. Results also show an improvement in recognition accuracy from 88.14% to 95.66% for passive and active exploration, respectively. Overall, this work offers a framework to allow robots to autonomously decide where to move and look next, to improve the performance during a visual object exploration and recognition task.",REJECTED,6,,
11,Estimating Sit-to-Stand Dynamics Using a Single Depth Camera,"Kinetic and dynamic motion analysis provides quantitative, functional assessments of human ability that are unobtainable through static imaging methods or subjective surveys. While biomechanics facilities are equipped to perform this measurement and analysis, the clinical translation of these methods is limited by the specialized skills and equipment needed. This paper presents and validates a method for estimating dynamic effects such as joint torques and body momenta using a single depth camera. An allometrically scaled, sagittal plane dynamic model is used to estimate the joint torques at the ankles, knees, hips, and low back, as well as the torso momenta, and shear and normal loads at the L5-S1 disk. These dynamic metrics are applied to the sit-to-stand motion and validated against a gold-standard biomechanical system consisting of full-body active motion-capture and force-sensing systems. The metrics obtained from the proposed method were found to have excellent concordance with peak metrics that are consistent with prior biomechanical studies. This suggests the feasibility of using this system for rapid clinical assessment, with applications in diagnostics, longitudinal tracking, and quantifying patient recovery.",REJECTED,6,,
12,Haptic discrimination of distance,"While quite some research has focussed on the accuracy of haptic perception of distance, information on the precision of haptic perception of distance is still scarce, particularly regarding distances perceived by making arm movements. In this study, eight conditions were measured to answer four main questions, which are: what is the influence of reference distance, movement axis, perceptual mode (active or passive) and stimulus type on the precision of this kind of distance perception? A discrimination experiment was performed with twelve participants. The participants were presented with two distances, using either a haptic device or a real stimulus. Participants compared the distances by moving their hand from a start to an end position. They were then asked to judge which of the distances was the longer, from which the discrimination threshold was determined for each participant and condition. The precision was influenced by reference distance. No effect of movement axis was found. The precision was higher for active than for passive movements and it was a bit lower for real stimuli than for rendered stimuli, but it was not affected by adding cutaneous information. Overall, the Weber fraction for the active perception of a distance of 25 or 35 cm was about 11% for all cardinal axes. The recorded position data suggest that participants, in order to be able to judge which distance was the longer, tried to produce similar speed profiles in both movements. This knowledge could be useful in the design of haptic devices. © 2014 van Beek et al.",ACCEPTED,,,
13,Early interaction between vision and touch during binocular rivalry,"Growing evidence shows that early sensory areas are involved in cross-modal processing, challenging the traditional view that confined multisensory analysis to high-level temporal and parietal areas. Haptic signals have been shown to influence the dynamics of binocular rivalry, a form of perceptual bistability that engages competition between monocular signals (Lunghi et al. , 2010, Current Biology , 20 (4), R143–R144). We investigated the role of spatial proximity, type of tactile stimulation (active or passive) and cross-modal attention in promoting fusion between vision and touch during binocular rivalry of orthogonally oriented gratings (±45°, size 2.5°, SF 2 c/cm). By varying the haptic orientation (±7.5°, ±15°, ±30°), we further investigated the orientation selectivity of the interaction. We found that both active exploration and passive tactile stimulation boosted the visual stimulus congruent with the tactile one (engraved grating), both prolonging conscious perception and restoring it from binocular rivalry suppression. The interaction was strictly tuned (less than one octave) to visuo-haptic spatial frequency and orientation. We also found that voluntary attention played a minor role in mediating the interaction, while temporal alignment and spatial proximity between visual and tactile stimuli were necessary for fusion of the cross-sensory signals, this latter result suggesting that the visual and the somatosensory spatial maps are aligned. Taken together, our results points to a very early multisensory interaction site, possibly V1.",ACCEPTED,,,
14,Plasticity in neuromagnetic cortical responses suggests enhanced auditory object representation,"Background: Auditory perceptual learning persistently modifies neural networks in the central nervous system. Central auditory processing comprises a hierarchy of sound analysis and integration, which transforms an acoustical signal into a meaningful object for perception. Based on latencies and source locations of auditory evoked responses, we investigated which stage of central processing undergoes neuroplastic changes when gaining auditory experience during passive listening and active perceptual training. Young healthy volunteers participated in a five-day training program to identify two pre-voiced versions of the stop-consonant syllable 'ba', which is an unusual speech sound to English listeners. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain responses were recorded during two pre-training and one post-training sessions. Underlying cortical sources were localized, and the temporal dynamics of auditory evoked responses were analyzed. Results: After both passive listening and active training, the amplitude of the P2m wave with latency of 200 ms increased considerably. By this latency, the integration of stimulus features into an auditory object for further conscious perception is considered to be complete. Therefore the P2m changes were discussed in the light of auditory object representation. Moreover, P2m sources were localized in anterior auditory association cortex, which is part of the antero-ventral pathway for object identification. The amplitude of the earlier N1m wave, which is related to processing of sensory information, did not change over the time course of the study.Conclusion: The P2m amplitude increase and its persistence over time constitute a neuroplastic change. The P2m gain likely reflects enhanced object representation after stimulus experience and training, which enables listeners to improve their ability for scrutinizing fine differences in pre-voicing time. Different trajectories of brain and behaviour changes suggest that the preceding effect of a P2m increase relates to brain processes, which are necessary precursors of perceptual learning. Cautious discussion is required when interpreting the finding of a P2 amplitude increase between recordings before and after training and learning. © 2013 Ross et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",REJECTED,8,,
15,Short psychotherapy in the treatment of psychosomatic vascular disorders,"Essential hypertension is one of the most frequent vascular and most typical psychosomatic diseases. The casual therapy is psychotherapy in a form of a short analysis dynamically oriented. This paper deals with the method and results obtained by short psychotherapy of 60 patients with essential hypertension, aged between 23 and 54. The therapeutic procedure is directed to the patients and to the patient-therapist conflict and interaction. The autopsychic conflict of not being able to invest a whole personality into the task of treatment was revealed in each patient. If free associations were manifested in the patient, the further treatment was aimed at revealing symptomatology and actual conflicts. Dispositions with aggressive tendencies were psychoreactively discovered, whereas, as relates the characters, those patients were extremely gay and vital personalities. The therapist's attitude kept varying from a passive listening to an active perceiving of emotional oscillations, never being that of a transfer neurosis. In achieving a therapeutical goal, a positive motivation was proved to be significant. Only in four patients the failure in treatment was due to a negative motivation and inability to choose a substitute. Although the estimation of short psychotherapy outcome based on the improvement of symptoms in essential hypertension has not been scientifically confirmed, it cannot be refuted as well, because each positive outcome is considered useful for the patient.",REJECTED,6,,
16,Comparison of 2 analgesia modalities in total knee replacement surgery: Is there an effect on knee function rehabilitation?,"Background: We compared the effects of continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) and continuous intraarticular block (CIAB) on pain, functional recovery and adverse effects after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Material/Methods: We prospectively randomized 54 patients undergoing TKA into 2 groups: CFNB (Group F) and CIAB (Group I). Surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine, diclofenac, and acetaminophen for the first 72 h postoperatively. Pain was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS), 48-h morphine consumption and 72-h local anesthetic dosage were recorded, motor blockade was assessed, maximum range of motion (ROM) was measured, and adverse effect profiles were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference in postoperative pain at rest, in passive motion, active motion, or active movement (2-min walk test (2MWT)) between study groups. Group I had less opioid usage in the first 24 h postoperatively (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups in the postoperative local anesthetic dosage (p>0.05). Significantly lower scores of Bromage scale in Group I in 72 h after surgery (p<0.05) were found. Group I had superior passive maximum ROM in 1 month after surgery and superior active maximum ROM on day 7 and at 1 month after surgery (p<0.05). Conclusions: Both CFNB and CIAB are effective postoperative analgesia methods after TKA. CIAB leads to lower postoperative opioid usage in the first 24 h, lower motor blockade in the first 72 h, and better knee function on day 7 and at 1 month after surgery.",REJECTED,6,,
17,Prediction of primary somatosensory neuron activity during active tactile exploration,"Primary sensory neurons form the interface between world and brain. Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neurons of awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by whisker angle, but well- predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are in apparent contrast to previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of sense organs.",REJECTED,6,,
18,The protective effec of continuous passive motion on living articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis: An experimental investigation in the rabbit,"A review of the literature on the pathogenesis of the destruction of articular cartilage in acute septic arthritis in humans presents a paradox in treatment by complete rest and intermittent active motion in its management. The paradox is resolved by observations on an experimental acute staphylococcal septic arthritis of the knee joint in adolescent rabbits. Twenty-four hours after the intra-articular injection of Staphylococcus aureus, the infected joints were surgically drained and the rabbits were treated by penicillin. During the first two weeks the involved knee joints of 51 rabbits were managed by one of the following three methods: Series I-immobilization (cast); Series II-intermittent active motion (cage activity); Series III-continuous passive motion. At the end of two weeks all rabbits were permitted normal cage activity until the time of sacrifice. The methods of assessment of the articular cartilage of the involved joints included lateral radiographs, gross examination, microscopic examination (including histochemistry), and biochemical determinations of the percent composition of collagen, keratin sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. A scoring system was developed to assess the articular cartilage in relation to cellularity, loss of matrix, cloning of chondrocytes, adhesions (pannus), and orthochromasia (with safranin-O). The rabbits in Series III tolerated continuous passive motion of their infected joints well; they appeared to be comfortable, slept and ate well, and continued to gain weight. Assessment of 28 involved joints after ten weeks revealed that continuous passive motion for two weeks had a striking and statistically significant protective effect on preventing progressive degeneration to the effects of either immobilization or intermittent active motion. In the knee joints of the animals managed by continuous passive motion there were fewer radiographic abnormalities, erosions, and osteophytes; less loss of cellularity and matrix; less cloning of chondrocytes; fewer adhesions (pannus); better orthochromasia with safranin-O; and more normal content of collagen, keratin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, and total hexosamine than in the knee joints of those rabbits managed either by immobilization or by intermittent active motion. Possible explanations of the protective effect of continuous passive motion the articular cartilage in an experimental model of acute septic arthritis include: (1) the prevention of adhesions (pannus); (2) the improvement of nutrition of the cartilage through increased diffusion of synovial fluid; (3) the enhancement of clearance of lysosomal enzymes and purulent exudate from the infected joint; and (4) the stimulation of living chondrocytes to synthesize the various components of the matrix. In the experimental model of septic arthritis neither immobilization nor intermittent active motion protected the articular cartilage from progressive degeneration. The concept of continuous passive motion may be applicable to the clinical management of acute septic arthritis in the human in combination with early surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.",REJECTED,6,,
19,Anterior cruciate ligament-deficient patients with passive knee joint laxity have a decreased range of anterior-posterior motion during active movements,"Background: Although instability of the knee joint is known to modify gait patterns, the amount that patients compensate for joint laxity during active movements remains unknown. Purpose: By developing a novel technique to allow the assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics, this study aimed to elucidate the role of passive joint laxity on active tibiofemoral kinematics during walking. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Using motion capture, together with combinations of advanced techniques for assessing skeletal kinematics (including the symmetrical axis of rotation approach [SARA], symmetrical center of rotation estimation [SCoRE], and optimal common shape technique [OCST]), a novel noninvasive approach to evaluate dynamic tibiofemoral motion was demonstrated as both reproducible and repeatable. Passive and active anterior-posterior translations of the tibiofemoral joint were then examined in 13 patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures that were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and compared with those in their healthy contralateral limbs. Results: Passive tibial anterior translation was significantly greater in the ACL-ruptured knees than in the contralateral healthy controls. However, the femora of the ACL-ruptured knees generally remained more posterior (∼3 mm) relative to the tibia within a gait cycle of walking compared with the healthy limbs. Surprisingly, the mean range of tibiofemoral anterior-posterior translation over an entire gait cycle was significantly lower in ACL-ruptured knees than in the healthy joints (P = .026). A positive correlation was detected between passive laxity and active joint mobility, but with a consistent reduction in the range of tibiofemoral anteriorposterior translation of approximately 3 mm in the ACL-deficient knees. Conclusion: It seems that either active stabilization of tibiofemoral kinematics or anterior subluxation of the tibia reduces joint translation in lax knees. This implies that either a muscular overcompensation mechanism or a physical limitation due to secondary passive stabilizers occurs within the joint and thus produces a situation that has a reduced range of active motion compared with knees with physiological stability. Clinical Relevance: The reduced range of active tibiofemoral translation suggests overloading of the passive structures in passively lax knees, either through excessive muscular action or joint subluxation, and could provide a plausible mechanism for explaining posttraumatic degeneration of cartilage in the joint. © 2013 The Author(s).",REJECTED,6,,

21,Functional reorganization in chronic hemiparetic patients after training: FMRI studies,"The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of short-term repetitive-bilateral exercise on the activation of motor network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eight control subjects and four chronic hemiparetic patients were investigated for the present study. The training program with a symmetrical upper-limb motion trainer was performed at 1 hr/day, 5 days/week during 6 weeks. Fugl-Meyer assessments (FMA) were performed every two weeks during the training. We compared cerebral and cerebellar cortical activations in two different tasks before and after the training program: (1) the only unaffected hand movement (Task 1), and (2) passive movements of the affected hand by the active movement of the unaffected hand (Task 2). fMRI was performed at 3T with wrist flexion-extension movement at 1 Hz during the motor tasks. All patients showed significant improvements of FMA scores in their paretic limbs after training. fMRI studies in Task 1 showed that cortical activations decreased in ipsilateral SMC but increased in contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and ipsilateral cerebellum (CRB). Task 2 showed cortical reorganizations in bilateral SMC, pre-motor area (PMA), supplementary area (SMA) and CRB.

22,Plasticity in developing brain: Active auditory exposure impacts prelinguistic acoustic mapping,"A major task across infancy is the creation and tuning of the acoustic maps that allow efficient native language processing. This process crucially depends on ongoing neural plasticity and keen sensitivity to environmental cues. Development of sensory mapping has been widely studied in animal models, demonstrating that cortical representations of the sensory environment are continuously modified by experience. One critical period for optimizing human language mapping is early in the first year; however, the neural processes involved and the influence of passive compared with active experience are as yet incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that, while both active and passive acoustic experience from 4 to 7 months of age, using temporally modulated nonspeech stimuli, impacts acoustic mapping, active experience confers a significant advantage. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we show that active experience increases perceptual vigilance/attention to environmental acoustic stimuli (e.g., larger and faster P2 peaks) when compared with passive experience or maturation alone. Faster latencies are also seen for the change discrimination peak (N2*) that has been shown to be a robust infant predictor of later language through age 4 years. Sharpening is evident for both trained and untrained stimuli over and above that seen for maturation alone. Effects were also seen on ERP morphology for the active experience group with development of more complex waveforms more often seen in typically developing 12- to 24-month-old children. The promise of selectively “fine-tuning” acoustic mapping as it emerges has far-reaching implications for the amelioration and/or prevention of developmental language disorders.",REJECTED,7,,

The case is clear for kinesthesia. Peripheral proprioceptive signals are altered by active muscle contractions, and the central mechanisms of kinesthetic sensations should be studied during active movement.

Hand transplant still remains a partly experimental procedure because of the small number of patients and short follow-up (not longer than 10 years). Most hand transplantations have been performed at the distal forearm level. Material and method. The transplant recipient was a 29-year-old man who had lost his dominant right hand 3 years before in a milling machine accident; the donor was a 52-year-old woman. The procurement and transport of the limb were performed according to standard procedures. Preparation of the donor limb and the patient's stump was performed simultaneously by two surgical teams. Anastomoses were done in the following order : bones-tendons-nerves-veins- artery. The radial artery and 3 large veins were anastomosed. The operative wound was closed without a skin graft. Ischemia time was 9 hours. Pharmacological treatment was similar to that usually administered to replantation patients; immunotherapy consisted of Simulect, Prograf, Cell-Cept, and steroids. Physiotherapy was started on the second postoperative day; it consisted of early protective active motion (EPM), continuous passive motion (CPM), splinting, and sensory stimulation. The function of internal organs was monitored; the early outcome was evaluated at 6 months after the transplantation. Results. The function of internal organs remained undisturbed, no rejection episodes were observed. Bony union was achieved after 11 weeks and progressed steadily, as did the range of motion and reinnervation. On the day of the preliminary assessment, the active range of motion was 200°, 2PD exceeded 15 mm, and electromyography demonstrated temperature sensation and hypothenar muscle function. Functional assessment according to the DASH questionnaire was rated at 67 points, and a quality of life evaluation with the SF-36 questionnaire produced a score of 110 points. Conclusion. The distal third of the forearm is a replantation zone promoting early functional recovery. hand transplant, rehabilitation, reinnervation, bony union © MEDSPORTPRESS, 2010;.",REJECTED,6,,
25,A trap motion in validating muscle activity prediction from musculoskeletal model using EMG,"Musculoskeletal modeling nowadays is becoming the most common tool for studying and analyzing human motion. Besides its potential in predicting muscle activity and muscle force during active motion, musculoskeletal modeling can also calculate many important kinetic data that are difficult to measure in vivo, such as joint force or ligament force. This paper will validate muscle activity predicted by the model during a static motion like knee flexion motion (squat motion). In this experiment, knee flexion motion was performed by 5 healthy subjects and modeled by using Gait Lower Extremity model from AnyBody Modeling System (AMS). Eight lower limb muscle activity prediction from the model will be validated by 8 EMG electrodes that measured the same muscles during squat motion. Muscle activity pattern and the position of onset would be used as a key factor in this validation study. Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to compare the pattern of both graphs. Knee joint force prediction from the model will also be compared with the literature studies. The result showed that 3 muscles showed high correlation coefficient, while the other 4 muscles showed slightly medium and one showed low correlation. Time delay of muscle activation between the model and EMG was recorded from Vastus Medialis muscle (18.38 ms) and Vastus Lateralis (22.8 ms), with muscle activation from the model was late compared to EMG. In conclusion, this statistical study has shown some detail differences between EMG and muscle activity prediction from the model. Knee flexion motion can be used as a trap motion when validating muscle activity of a musculoskeletal model, because the model will activate muscle activity based on motion data of markers, while in knee-flexed position, there was no marker’s movement, but the EMG was highly active due to the posture of the subjects in maintaining the knee-flexed position. However, the knee compressive force prediction from the model has showed positive confirmation from the literatures.",REJECTED,2,,
26,Estimation of self-turning in the dark: Comparison between active and passive rotation,"The present work compares passive and active rotations in darkness with the aim of characterizing the contribution of efferent and proprioceptive information to the perception of angular displacement. The perception of angular displacements was measured in 12 naive subjects (Ss), who either stood on a rotating platform (passive mode, P) or actively turned about their vertical axis by stepping around 'on the spot' on a stationary platform (active mode, A). Rotations consisted of short acceleration epochs followed by constant velocity periods of 18.5, 37, and 55°/s, with angular displacements ranging from 30°to 810°(presented in a randomized order); in the case of active turning, Ss had learned to approximately produce any of these three velocity levels on command. Ss indicated perceived displacement either verbally (verbal estimation mode, E), or by stopping their rotation when self-displacement appeared to match the magnitude specified by the experimenter (targeting, T). The resulting four conditions (PE, PT, AE, AT) were administered blockwise. In none of the four conditions was there a systematic dependence of perception on turning velocity. Therefore, the results were pooled across velocities, and the Ss' performance was summarized in the form of estimation curves showing median estimates as a function of physical displacement. There were several differences between the passive and active modes: AE- and AT-estimation curves were linear, close to veracity, and fairly similar to each other. In contrast, the PE-curve was curved rightwardly ('saturation'), with small displacements being overestimated and large ones underestimated, whereas the PT-curve was linear and indicated a pronounced overestimation of large displacements. Moreover, both the random and the systematic errors (measures of individual consistency and correctness of individual calibration, respectively) were significantly smaller in the active than in the passive modes. The observed independence of Ss' perception from turning velocity also during passive rotation suggests that the perceptual time constant was significantly longer than 16 s (a value cited as typical for vestibular perception), being possibly 'enhanced' by contextual implications and by expectations of the Ss. The clear improvement of perceptual performance in the active mode testifies to the importance of the efferent and proprioceptive signals arising during active motion. On the assumption that these signals are about as 'noisy' as the vestibular ones, the smaller errors during active turning could result from their combination with the vestibular signal. Alternatively, they could also be intrinsically less noisy than the vestibular signal and simply replace the latter during active motion. In the context of these alternatives (which are not exhaustive), the general problem of sensory fusion is discussed, that is, by which mechanisms are signals from different sensory sources combined to obtain a unified representation of the self's orientation.",ACCEPTED,,,
27,Corticomotor excitability of wrist flexor and extensor muscles during active and passive movement,"The excitability of the corticospinal projection to upper and lower limbs is constantly modulated during voluntary and passive movement; however a direct comparison during a comparable movement has not been reported. In the present study we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to compare corticomotor excitability to the extensor and flexor carpi radialis (ECR/FCR) muscles of the forearm during voluntary rhythmic wrist movement (through 45° of range), during a matched (for range and rhythm) passive movement of the wrist, and while the wrist was stationary (in mid-range). TMS was delivered when the wrist was in the neutral position. With passive and active movement, and for both FCR and ECR, corticomotor excitability was reduced during lengthening relative to shortening phases of movement. With active movement, this pattern was maintained and superimposed on an overall increase in excitability to both muscles that was greater for the ECR. The results favor a common pattern of excitability changes shared by extensor and flexor muscles as they undergo lengthening and shortening, which may be mediated by afferent input during both passive and active movement. This is combined with an overall increase in excitability associated with active movement that is greater for extensor muscles perhaps due to differences in the strength of the corticomotor projection to these muscles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",REJECTED,2,,
28,An investigation of the effect of continuous passive motion and lower limb passive movement on heart rate in normal volunteers,"Previous studies have indicated that passive movement of the lower limb may affect cardiopulmonary function via a neuronal reflex activated by afferent inputs from articular receptors. This study compared the effect of lower limb continuous passive motion, lower limb passive movement and lower limb active movement on heart rate in normal volunteers. These techniques are used extensively by physiotherapists in clinical practice. A knowledge of the influence of these techniques on cardiac function should be an important factor in designing maintenance programmes for patients with cardiovascular disorders. The study shows that while lower limb active movement has a significant effect on heart rate, lower limb passive movement and lower limb continuous passive motion produce only a small increase in heart rate. This suggests that lower limb passive motion and continuous passive motion are techniques which may be safely used as a means of maintaining lower limb range of movement and function in the treatment of patients whose cardiovascular system is compromised, although further study is necessary to establish that such patients respond similarly. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",REJECTED,2,,
29,Internal models of self-motion: Computations that suppress vestibular reafference in early vestibular processing,"In everyday life, vestibular sensors are activated by both self-generated and externally applied head movements. The ability to distinguish inputs that are a consequence of our own actions (i.e., active motion) from those that result from changes in the external world (i.e., passive or unexpected motion) is essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. Recent work has made progress toward understanding how the brain distinguishes between these two kinds of sensory inputs. We have performed a series of experiments in which single-unit recordings were made from vestibular afferents and central neurons in alert macaque monkeys during rotation and translation. Vestibular afferents showed no differences in firing variability or sensitivity during active movements when compared to passive movements. In contrast, the analyses of neuronal firing rates revealed that neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing (i.e., in the vestibular nuclei) were effectively less sensitive to active motion. Notably, however, this ability to distinguish between active and passive motion was not a general feature of early central processing, but rather was a characteristic of a distinct group of neurons known to contribute to postural control and spatial orientation. Our most recent studies have addressed how vestibular and proprioceptive inputs are integrated in the vestibular cerebellum, a region likely to be involved in generating an internal model of self-motion. We propose that this multimodal integration within the vestibular cerebellum is required for eliminating self-generated vestibular information from the subsequent computation of orientation and posture control at the first central stage of processing. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",REJECTED,4,,

We use a non-parametric technique, the Kernel density estimator, applied to a data set from the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS), consisting in 12 cohorts of new manufacturing firms followed for 6 years. Since the patterns of convergence to the limit distribution are different between industries, we conclude that the model of passive learning is consistent with some of them, the active exploration model with others, the evolutionary model with all of them.",REJECTED,2,,

The role of proprioception in daily activities, exercise, and sports has been extensively investigated, using different techniques, yet the proprioceptive mechanisms underlying human movement control are still unclear. In the current work we have reviewed understanding of proprioception and the three testing methods: threshold to detection of passive motion, joint position reproduction, and active movement extent discrimination, all of which have been used for assessing proprioception. The origin of the methods, the different testing apparatus, and the procedures and protocols used in each approach are compared and discussed.

32,Intra- and inter-raters reliabilities of a stepped clinical assessment of chronic spastic paresis in adults,"Objective To determine intra- and inter-raters reliabilities of a stepped clinical assessment in chronic spastic paresis for upper and lower limbs in adults. Methods Eighteen adult subjects (age: 50 ± 14 years, women: 21%) with upper and lower limbs chronic hemiparesis were evaluated by four raters (3 PMR, 1 physiotherapist, age 47 ± 11 years; experience in spastic paresis 14 ± 9 years). This assessment involves performing a passive muscle stretch at 2 velocities, very slow and very fast, followed by an active maximal movement by the patient against the tested muscle and then a 15-second series of active movements of maximal amplitude of which only the last one is measured. Eight muscles were tested: shoulder extensors, elbow flexors, wrist flexors, fingers flexors, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, soleus and gastrocnemii. Five parameters were collected: maximal range of passive motion XV1, angle of catch XV3, spasticity grade Y, maximal range of active motion XA, and residual range of motion XVA15 after 15 seconds of rapid alternating movements. Each patient was evaluated on two occasions by each rater one week apart. After the first 9 patients, a 2-hour training was organized before assessing the last 9 patients. Main outcome measures were intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI95%) for quantitative data and agreement frequencies for ranges of movement (ordinal data). Results Before training, intra- and inter-reliabilities were excellent: intra-rater ICCs by parameter all muscles taken together: XV1 0.90 [0.60-0.98], XV3 0.84 [0.45-0.96], XA 0.92 [0.68-0.98], XA15 0.90 [0.68-0.98] and inter-raters ICCs, XV1 0.90 [0.72-0.97], XV3 0.83 [0.56-0.95], XA 0.95 [0.87-0.99], XA15 0.95 [0.86-0.98]. After training, both reliabilities improved: intra-rater ICCs, XV1 0.91 [0.65-0.98], XV3 0.92 [0.66-0.98], XA 0.94 [0.67-0.99], XA15 0.93 [0.64-0.99] and inter-raters ICCs, XV10.91 [0.74-0.98], XV3 0.91 [0.75-0.97], XA 0.94 [0.85-0.99], XA15 0.96 [0.87-0.99] (P < 0.05). Training also improved intra- and inter-raters agreement frequencies for ranges of movement (Y): respectively 75 and 70% before training, 84 and 76% after training (P < 0.05). Discussion The stepped clinical assessment shows an excellent reliability to evaluate resistance against movement in chronic spastic paresis in the upper and lower limbs of adults. Training, associated with further improvement in reliability, needed nevertheless to be strengthened for shoulder extensors, fingers flexors and rectus femoris.",REJECTED,6,,

34,Direct and reversed dorsal digital island flaps: a review of 65 cases,"BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of soft tissue defects in fingers continues to be a challenging problem. The purpose of this study is to report the reconstruction of small-to-moderate defects of fingers with dorsal digital island flap (DDIF) and to evaluate the efficacy of use of the flap.
METHODS: Over last six years, a retrospective study was conducted with 65 patients who had soft tissue defects of fingers treated with the DDIF. Sixty-nine soft-tissue defects were found in 69 fingers in 65 patients. Based on the flow direction of blood supply, the patients were divided into two groups: the direct (n=35) and reversed (n=30) DDIF groups. In addition, based on the different donor sites, the direct DDIF group was divided into two subgroups: the proximal phalangeal direct DDIF subgroup (n=16) and the extended pedicle direct DDIF subgroup (n=19). The main outcomes were static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of flap and joint motion.
RESULTS: At the final follow-up, the mean static two-point discrimination of the flaps was 9.7mm (range, 8 to 12mm) in the proximal phalangeal direct DDIF subgroup and 8.3mm (range, 7 to 11mm) in the extended pedicle direct DDIF subgroup, with a significant difference (p=0.005). In the direct DDIF group, there was no significant difference in total active motion between the donor fingers and the opposite sides. In the reversed DDIF group, the mean total active motion of the donor fingers was 170° and the data of the opposite sides was 181°, with a significant difference (p=0.024). Maximum amplitude losses of 15° were seen in 12% of patients in the distal interphalangeal joint.
CONCLUSIONS: The DDIF is reliable and technically easy for reconstructing small-to-moderate defects of fingers. The extended pedicle direct DDIF may be an optional solution when sensory reconstruction is needed.",REJECTED,6,,
35,Effect of muscle loading and forearm rotation on radiocapitellar joint congruency,"INTRODUCTION: Degenerative changes are thought to occur as a result of altered j oint contact area and stresses caused by trauma. Much of the current literature related to the radiocapitellar joint focuses on the prosthetic design of radial head implants and their effect on joint contact mechanics. Native radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics, however, remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of muscle loading and forearm rotation on radiocapitellar joint congruency. Joint congruency is a measure of the relative 3D joint space between the subchondral surfaces of the joint and can be used to understand the underlying joint contact mechanics. METHODS: Joint congruency was examined in 7 cadaveric specimens (Male: 77±10 years) employing a previously developed inter-bone distance algorithm. Muscle tendons were attached to pneumatic actuators of a previously developed motion simulator to rotate the forearm from full pronation to supination2. Active and passive forearm rotation was performed with the elbow in 90° of flexion. CT scans were acquired prior to testing to create three-dimensional bony reconstructions of the proximal radius and distal ulna. Rigid-body computer registration was used to align the 3D CT models to the specimen during testing3. Inter-bone distances were measured to investigate the relative position of the capitellum to the radial head to assess overall joint congruency (2.5mm of inter-bone distance). Distances were displayed on 3D color-contour maps. Differences in congruency during active and passive forearm rotation were examined across the range of motion (two-way) and for every 10° of rotation using a one-way repeated measures of variance. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Figure 1 shows the mean (±1 SD) joint congruency as measured by the surface area on the subchondral bone that has an inter-bone distance of < 2.5mm for all specimens undergoing active and passive forearm rotation. The joint congruency decreases from active to passive forearm rotation (p=0.001). Examining the individual forearm positions, statistically significant differences between active and passive motion were found at -40° (p=0.04) and at -20° (p=0.03). Color-contour maps are shown across the range of motion in active and passive forearm rotation for a representative specimen (Figure 2). During active and passive rotation, as the elbow rotates from pronation to supination, the region of close proximity (shown from green-blue) decreases and is focused on the medial region of the radial head. DICUSSION: Previous investigations examining radiocapitellar joint contact have relied on invasive techniques (experimental casting, tekscan). Using this previously developed technique to evaluate joint tracking patterns, physiologic motion was simulated and the resulting joint congruency was non-invasively examined. The results of this current study suggest that the radiocapitellar joint is more reduced due to muscle forces acting across the joint during active motion. This effect is seen more in pronation than supination as indicated by finding statistical differences in joint congruency at 20 and 40 degrees of pronation. Future work is needed to better define the patterns of congruency pattern between active and passive rotation and explore the relationship to the patterns of degenerative changes which have been documented for this articulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Increasing our understanding of native radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics is useful in prosthetic design and in understanding the etiology of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, having knowledge of the effect of muscle load during physiologic forearm rotation may have implications for rehabilitation.",REJECTED,6,,

Diagnostic subgroups of TMD (osteoarthrosis, anterior disc displacement with/without reduction, TMD-myo) can be distinguished by a combination of active movements, passive opening and palpation. Active movement appeared to be the most powerful test for distinguishing the subgroups of TMD, e.g. myogenous, arthrogenous, myogenous and arthrogenous. It is advised to have an open mind in the clinical examination and to be aware of the many mimicking disorders before reaching a diagnosis. An anamnestic questionnaire addressing the pain history, signs and symptoms of TMD, functional impairments, correlates of TMD, psychosocial evaluation and general health status is mandatory. Headache and neck pain often accompany TMD. In appropriate situations it is advised to refer to the proper specialist, before starting treatment for TMD. Orthopedic tests of the cervical spine are of minor importance in discriminating between patients with TMD and patients with cervical spine disorders (CSD). It is therefore advised to evaluate the function of the stomatognathic system in patients with neck complaints to rule out a possible involvement of this system.",REJECTED,6,,
37,Heading judgments during active and passive self-motion,"Previous studies have generally considered heading perception to be a visual task. However, since judgments of heading direction are required only during self-motion, there are several other relevant senses which could provide supplementary and, in some cases, necessary information to make accurate and precise judgments of the direction of self-motion. We assessed the contributions of several of these senses using tasks chosen to reflect the reference system used by each sensory modality. Head-pointing and rod-pointing tasks were performed in which subjects aligned either the head or an unseen pointer with the direction of motion during whole body linear motion. Passive visual and vestibular stimulation was generated by accelerating subjects at sub- or supravestibular thresholds down a linear track. The motor-kinesthetic system was stimulated by having subjects actively walk along the track. A helmet-mounted optical system, fixed either on the cart used to provide passive visual or vestibular information or on the walker used in the active walking conditions, provided a stereoscopic display of an optical flow field. Subjects could be positioned at any orientation relative to the heading, and heading judgments were obtained using unimodal visual, vestibular, or walking cues, or combined visual-vestibular and visual-walking cues. Vision alone resulted in reasonably precise and accurate head-pointing judgments (0.3° constant errors, 2.9° variable errors), but not rod-pointing judgments (3.5° constant errors, 5.9° variable errors). Concordant visual-walking stimulation slightly decreased the variable errors and reduced constant pointing errors to close to zero, while head-pointing errors were unaffected. Concordant visual-vestibular stimulation did not facilitate either response. Stimulation of the vestibular system in the absence of vision produced imprecise rod-pointing responses, while variable and constant pointing errors in the active walking condition were comparable to those obtained in the visual condition. During active self-motion, subjects made large headpointing undershoots when visual information was not available. These results suggest that while vision provides sufficient information to identify the heading direction, it cannot, in isolation, be used to guide the motor response required to point toward or move in the direction of self-motion. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",REJECTED,2,,

39,Perceptual and motor effects of agonist-antagonist muscle vibration in man,"Perceptual and motor effects of vibration applied simultaneously to the distal tendons of the Biceps and Triceps muscles, in isometric conditions and without sight of the stimulated arm, have been studied in human volunteers. Motor effects, measured by surface EMG, are inexistent when the flexor and extensor muscles are simultaneously vibrated at the same frequency. However, EMG activity appears in the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency when simultaneous vibration is applied at different frequencies. The sensations felt by the subjects were reproduced by the nonvibrated arm and recorded by a goniometer. The studies show that the velocity and the amplitude of the ilusory movement is related to the difference in vibration frequency applied to the two muscles. The direction of movement felt (flexion or extension) is that produced by shortening of the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency. When the two vibration frequencies are the same, there is either no sensation of movement, or a sensation of very slow movement. These results support the notion that the sensation of movement at a joint may be derived from a central processing of the proprioceptive inflow data obtained from flexor and extensor muscles. This interpretation may also be valid for the results obtained earlier by vibration of a single muscle. Furthermore, it is coherent with data on spindle afferent fibres obtained by microneurography in man during passive or active movements. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",REJECTED,9,,

Overall, the perceived wetness was differed between static and dynamic touch independent of pressure and the participants scored the dry-cold stimulus as relatively dry for dynamic touch.

42,Flexor tendon excursion and load during passive and active simulated motion: A cadaver study,"The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of tendon excursion and load experienced during simulated active and passive rehabilitation exercises. Six cadaver specimens were utilized to examine tendon excursion and load. Lateral fluoroscopic images were used to measure the excursions of metal markers placed in the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons of the index, middle, and ring fingers. Measurements were performed during ten different passive and active simulated motions. Mean tendon forces were higher in all active versus passive movements. Blocking movements placed the highest loads on the flexor tendons. Active motion resulted in higher tendon excursion than did passive motion. Simulated hook position resulted in the highest total tendon excursion and the highest inter-tendinous excursion. This knowledge may help optimize the management of the post-operative exercise therapy regimen. © The Author(s) 2012.",REJECTED,6,,
43,A unified internal model theory to resolve the paradox of active versus passive self-motion sensation,"Brainstem and cerebellar neurons implement an internal model to accurately estimate self-motion during externally generated (‘passive’) movements. However, these neurons show reduced responses during self-generated (‘active’) movements, indicating that predicted sensory consequences of motor commands cancel sensory signals. Remarkably, the computational processes underlying sensory prediction during active motion and their relationship to internal model computations during passive movements remain unknown. We construct a Kalman filter that incorporates motor commands into a previously established model of optimal passive self-motion estimation. The simulated sensory error and feedback signals match experimentally measured neuronal responses during active and passive head and trunk rotations and translations. We conclude that a single sensory internal model can combine motor commands with vestibular and proprioceptive signals optimally. Thus, although neurons carrying sensory prediction error or feedback signals show attenuated modulation, the sensory cues and internal model are both engaged and critically important for accurate self-motion estimation during active head movements.",REJECTED,6,,
44,"Split-Belt walking induces changes in active, but not passive, perception of step length","Successful motor control requires accurate estimation of our body in space for planning, executing, and evaluating the outcome of our actions. It has been shown that the estimation of limb position is susceptible to motor adaptation. However, a similar effect has not been found in locomotion, possibly due to how it was tested. We hypothesized that split-belt walking with the legs moving at different speeds changes the estimation of the legs’ position when taking a step. Thus, we assessed young subjects’ perception of step length (i.e., inter-feet distance at foot landing) when they moved their legs (active perception) or when the legs were moved by the experimenter (passive perception). We found that the active perception of step length was substantially altered following split-belt walking, whereas passive perception exhibited minor changes. This suggests that split-belt walking induced the adaptation of efferent signals, without altering sensory signals. We also found that active perceptual shifts were sensitive to how they were tested: they were most salient in the trailing leg and at short step lengths. Our results suggest that split-belt walking could modulate the deficient perception of step length post-stroke, which may contribute to gait asymmetries impairing patients’ mobility.",ACCEPTED,,YES,
45,On the relative complexity of active vs. passive visual search,"Here, this author attempts to tie the concept of active perception to attentive processing in general and to the complexity level analysis of visual search described previously; the aspects of active vision as they have been currently described form a subset of the full spectrum of attentional capabilities. Our approach is motivated by the search requirements of vision tasks and thus we cast the problem as one of search preceding the application of methods for shape-from-X, optical flow, etc., and recognition in general. This perspective permits a dimension of analysis not found in current formulations of the active perception problem, that of computational complexity. This article describes where the active perception paradigm does and does not provide computational benefits along this dimension. A formalization of the search component of active perception is presented in order to accomplish this. The link to attentional mechanisms is through the control of data acquisition and processing by the active process. It should be noted that the analysis performed here applies to the general hypothesize-and-test search strategy, to time-varying scenes as well as to the general problem of integration of successive fixations. Finally, an argument is presented as to why this framework is an extension of the behaviorist approaches to active vision. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",REJECTED,4,,
46,Contribution of motion parallax to segmentation and depth perception,"Relative image motion resulting from active movement of the observer could potentially serve as a powerful perceptual cue, both for segmentation of object boundaries and for depth perception. To examine the perceptual role of motion parallax from shearing motion, we measured human performance in three psychophysical tasks: segmentation, depth ordering, and depth magnitude estimation. Stimuli consisted of random dot textures that were synchronized to head movement with sine- or square-wave modulation patterns. Segmentation was assessed with a 2AFC orientation judgment of a motion-defined boundary. In the depth-ordering task, observers reported which modulation half-cycle appeared in front of the other. Perceived depth magnitude was matched to that of a 3D rendered image with multiple static cues. The results indicate that head movement might not be important for segmentation, even though it is crucial for obtaining depth from motion parallax-thus, concomitant depth perception does not appear to facilitate segmentation. Our findings suggest that segmentation works best for abrupt, sharply defined motion boundaries, whereas smooth gradients are more powerful for obtaining depth from motion parallax. Thus, motion parallax may contribute in a different manner to segmentation and to depth perception and suggests that their underlying mechanisms might be distinct. © ARVO.",REJECTED,9,,
47,Active Vision for Tremor Disease Monitoring,"The aim of this work is to introduce a prototype for monitoring tremor diseases using computer vision techniques. While vision has been previously used for this purpose, the system we are introducing differs intrinsically from other traditional systems. The essential difference is characterized by the placement of the camera on the user's body rather than in front of it, and thus reversing the whole process of motion estimation. This is called active motion tracking. Active vision is simpler in setup and achieves more accurate results compared to traditional arrangements, which we refer to as “passive” here. One main advantage of active tracking is its ability to detect even tiny motions using its simple setup, and that makes it very suitable for monitoring tremor disorders.",REJECTED,2,,
48,Transcortical reflexes and servo control of movement,"Sherrington proposed that the major role of proprioceptors is in processing afferent inputs generated by the active movements of the animal itself, and noted that the reflex effects of proprioceptive inputs are 'mild'. Current experimental results are consistent with the view that the major role of both segmental and transcortical proprioceptive reflexes is in small active movements and active postural stability, with muscle afferent inputs reducing '...errors of muscle length produced by fluctuating levels of motor discharge...' as stated by Goodwin and coworkers in 1978. Exteroceptive reflexes generate intense muscular responses and are of critical importance in prompt reprogramming essential for effective responses to environmental stimuli. Within the motor cortex (MI) there is a caudal region (MI/c) which receives exteroceptive cutaneous inputs and a rostral region (MI/r) which receives proprioceptive inputs. Transcortical reflexes mediated via pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) of MI/r have properties which are analogous to segmental proprioceptive reflexes: changes of muscle length elicit PTN discharges which oppose the length change and so act to maintain stability. Furthermore, MI/r PTNs which are recruited earliest for small active movements are most sensitive to proprioceptive inputs. Data are not yet available concerning transcortical reflexes via MI/c during voluntary movement, but it is speculated that the cutaneous reflexes via MI/c might be functionally analogous to segmental cutaneous reflexes. Short-latency reflex responses also occur in postcentral (PoC) PTNs, and in this report we present results concerning the properties of PoC PTNs during active and passive movement. Caudal (area 2-5) PoC PTNs were similar to MI PTNs in that they often discharged prior to electromyogram (EMG) activity with active movement, and had different discharge frequencies with different steady state loads, but were unlike most MI PTNs in having the same changes of discharge with active and passive movement. Our finding of PoC discharge prior to movement onset, confirming that of Soso and Fetz in 1980, is discussed in connection with the concept of corollary discharge.",ACCEPTED,,YES,
49,FMRI assessment of upper extremity related brain activation with an MRI-compatible manipulandum,"Purpose: Longitudinal studies to evaluate the effect of rehabilitative therapies require an objective, reproducible and quantitative means for testing function in vivo. An fMRI assessment tool for upper extremity related brain activation using an MRI-compatible manipulandum was developed and tested for use in neurorehabilitation research. Methods: Fifteen healthy, right-handed subjects participated in two fMRI sessions, which were three to four weeks apart. A block design paradigm, composed of three conditions of subject-passive movement, subject-active movement and rest, was employed for the fMRI recordings. During the rest condition, subjects simply held the device handle without applying any force or movement. The same type of auditory and visual instructions were given in all the three conditions, guiding the subjects to perform the motor tasks interactively with the MRI-compatible arm manipulandum. The tasks were controlled across the fMRI sessions. The subjects' brain activation was recorded by fMRI, and their behavioral performance was recorded by the manipulandum. The brain network activated by the subjects' interaction with the manipulandum was identified, and the reproducibility and reliability of the obtained activation were determined. Results: All subjects completed the trial protocol. Two subjects were excluded from analysis due to head motion artifacts. All passive movements were performed well. Four out of the total 780 active movements were missed by two subjects. Brain activation was found in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and non-primary motor cortex as well as in subcortical areas in the thalamus, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. These activations were consistent across the two fMRI sessions. Conclusion: The MRI-compatible manipulandum elicited robust and reproducible brain activations in healthy subjects during the subject-active and subject-passive upper extremity motor tasks with a block design paradigm. This system is promising for many applications in neurorehabilitation research and may be useful for longitudinal studies. © 2010 CARS.",ACCEPTED,,,
50,Active touch does not improve sequential processing in a counting task,"Active touch involves tactile and proprioceptive sensory inputs, activation of the motor system and executive functions. It has been shown by the previous literature that active touch facilitates shape recognition. Since both active and passive exploration requires sequential presentation of the tactile inputs, this facilitation may be due to the improvement of the sequential-processing mechanism. The effects of active and passive touch on the sequential processing of tactile inputs were tested at different stimulus-presentation rates in a counting task. Active touch did not improve the performance, which shows that the additional sensory and motor information conveyed by active exploration are not utilized by the sequential-processing mechanism. Therefore, the results cannot be explained by the feature-specific theory of sequential processing. On the other hand, the counting errors were higher than those predicted by the limitation of the minimal inter-stimulus interval, which is suggested by the central-timing theory. Consequently, it is proposed that a mechanism based on the central-timing theory may contribute to tactile sequential processing, but the bottleneck at high presentation rates is probably due to short-term memory.",ACCEPTED,,,
51,O papel da experiência motora no desenvolvimento global: as implicações na criança com paralisia cerebral,"Resumo A influência da atividade motora e da manipulação na aprendizagem global tem sido suportada pela perspetiva de que o movimento ativo é importante para o desenvolvimento percetivo típico, não podendo ser substituído por movimentos passivos. Por outro lado, considera-se que a atividade psicomotora potencia a internalização do movimento e a relação do corpo com o espaço. Assim, a aprendizagem humana e a conquista de estádios de desenvolvimento surgirá como resultado da experiência motora, posteriormente reforçada na organização cerebral pela experiência reflexiva. No entanto, nem todas as crianças cumprem as etapas de desenvolvimento psicomotor nos períodos típicos. Quando a questão se coloca face a crianças em desvantagem, nomeadamente com necessidades educativas especiais de caráter motor, como é o caso da paralisia cerebral, a tónica pode ganhar expressão particular. As experiências psicomotoras e sociais são, por vezes, barradas por condicionantes que privam as crianças de vivências que ocorrem de forma autónoma e espontânea, tipicamente, resultantes do desenvolvimento global. No presente texto, atravessaremos uma revisão de estudos que trazem evidências no domínio da influência da experiência motora no desenvolvimento e na aprendizagem, nomeadamente do papel da exploração ativa em idades precoces. Esta abordagem e a sua discussão, com ênfase na implicação na aprendizagem e desenvolvimento de crianças com necessidades educativas especiais de caráter motor, com destaque para a Martins, Catarina (2013).

Abstract The influence of motor activity and manipulation on the global learning has been supported by the perspective that active movement is vital to typical visuomotor and perceptual development and that it cannot be replaced by passive movements. Moreover, it is also considered that motor experience enables psychomotor development, the internalization of the body in space and the conquest of development stages. Thus, human learning emerges as the result of motor experience, later reinforced in the brain organization by reflective experience. However, not all children comply with the stages of psychomotor development in typical periods. When the issue arises regarding disadvantaged children, in particular, children with special educational needs as is the case of children with cerebral palsy, the focus can gain higher relevance. Motor and social experiences are sometimes blocked out by conditions that deprive children of experiences that are typically experienced autonomously and spontaneously. In this text, we will cross a review of major studies that provide evidence within the area of influence of motor experience on development and learning. What is the role of active exploration at early ages? To what extent does the motor action underlie perception? The discussion of this issue with focus on implications in learning and development of children with special educational needs, with an emphasis on cerebral palsy, are some of the topics that underlie this paper.",REJECTED,1,,
52,Microsaccades for neuromorphic stereo vision,"Depth perception through stereo vision is an important feature of biological and artificial vision systems. While biological systems can compute disparities effortlessly, it requires intensive processing for artificial vision systems. The computing complexity resides in solving the correspondence problem – finding matching pairs of points in the two eyes. Inspired by the retina, event-based vision sensors allow a new constraint to solve the correspondence problem: time. Relying on precise spike-time, spiking neural networks can take advantage of this constraint. However, disparities can only be computed from dynamic environments since event-based vision sensors only report local changes in light intensity. In this paper, we show how microsaccadic eye movements can be used to compute disparities from static environments. To this end, we built a robotic head supporting two Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capable of independent panning and simultaneous tilting. We evaluate the method on both static and dynamic scenes perceived through microsaccades. This paper demonstrates the complementarity of event-based vision sensors and active perception leading to more biologically inspired robots.",REJECTED,2,,
53,Otoacoustic emissions from insect ears: Evidence of active hearing?,"Sensitive hearing organs often employ nonlinear mechanical sound processing which generates distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Such emissions are also recordable from tympanal organs of insects. In vertebrates (including humans), otoacoustic emissions are considered by-products of active sound amplification through specialized sensory receptor cells in the inner ear. Force generated by these cells primarily augments the displacement amplitude of the basilar membrane and thus increases auditory sensitivity. As in vertebrates, the emissions from insect ears are based on nonlinear mechanical properties of the sense organ. Apparently, to achieve maximum sensitivity, convergent evolutionary principles have been realized in the micromechanics of these hearing organs-although vertebrates and insects possess quite different types of receptor cells in their ears. Just as in vertebrates, otoacoustic emissions from insects ears are vulnerable and depend on an intact metabolism, but so far in tympanal organs, it is not clear if auditory nonlinearity is achieved by active motility of the sensory neurons or if passive cellular characteristics cause the nonlinear behavior. In the antennal ears of flies and mosquitoes, however, active vibrations of the flagellum have been demonstrated. Our review concentrates on experiments studying the tympanal organs of grasshoppers and moths; we show that their otoacoustic emissions are produced in a frequency-specific way and can be modified by electrical stimulation of the sensory cells. Even the simple ears of notodontid moths produce distinct emissions, although they have just one auditory neuron. At present it is still uncertain, both in vertebrates and in insects, if the nonlinear amplification so essential for sensitive sound processing is primarily due to motility of the somata of specialized sensory cells or to active movement of their (stereo-)cilia. We anticipate that further experiments with the relatively simple ears of insects will help answer these questions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",REJECTED,6,,

It is used to investigate perceptual processes and multisensory interactions. In the presented study we aimed to achieve the projected sensation using a paradigm designed to achieve a Virtual Hand Illusion (VHI). This allowed the exploration of novel stimuli including passive and active movement of the arm, self stimulus and haptic stimuli other than just brushing. Our results showed similar effects to the original RHI and demonstrated the advantage of active haptic stimulation for enhancement of body ownership. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",REJECTED,6,,
55,Effective motion learning for a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling,"We propose a method for realizing effective dynamic motion learning in a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling. Flexible-joint robots have recently attracted attention because of their adaptiveness, safety, and, in particular, dynamic motions. It is difficult to control robots that require dynamic motion. In past studies, attractors and oscillators were designed as motion primitives of an assumed task in advance. However, it is difficult to adapt to unintended environmental changes using such methods. To overcome this problem, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) that does not require predetermined parameters. In this research, we propose a method for facilitating effective learning. First, a robot learns simple motions via motor babbling, acquiring body dynamics using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Motor babbling is the process of movement that infants use to acquire their own body dynamics during their early days. Next, the robot learns additional motions required for a target task using the acquired body dynamics. For acquiring these body dynamics, the robot uses motor babbling with its redundant flexible joints to learn motion primitives. This redundancy implies that there are numerous possible motion patterns. In comparison to a basic learning task, the motion primitives are simply modified to adjust to the task. Next, we focus on the types of motions used in motor babbling. We classify the motions into two motion types, passive motion and active motion. Passive motion involves inertia without any torque input, whereas active motion involves a torque input. The robot acquires body dynamics from the passive motion and a means of torque generation from the active motion. As a result, we demonstrate the importance of performing prior learning via motor babbling before learning a task. In addition, task learning is made more efficient by dividing the motion into two types of motor babbling patterns.",REJECTED,6,,
56,Active and passive spatial learning in human navigation: Acquisition of graph knowledge,"It is known that active exploration of a new environment leads to better spatial learning than does passive visual exposure. We ask whether specific components of active learning differentially contribute to particular forms of spatial knowledge-the exploration-specific learning hypothesis. Previously, we found that idiothetic information during walking is the primary active contributor to metric survey knowledge (Chrastil & Warren, 2013). In this study, we test the contributions of 3 components to topological graph and route knowledge: visual information, idiothetic information, and cognitive decision making. Four groups of participants learned the locations of 8 objects in a virtual hedge maze by (a) walking or (b) watching a video, crossed with (1) either making decisions about their path or (2) being guided through the maze. Route and graph knowledge were assessed by walking in the maze corridors from a starting object to the remembered location of a test object, with frequent detours. Decision making during exploration significantly contributed to subsequent route finding in the walking condition, whereas idiothetic information did not. Participants took novel routes and the metrically shortest routes on the majority of both direct and barrier trials, indicating that labeled graph knowledge-not merely route knowledge-was acquired. We conclude that, consistent with the exploration-specific learning hypothesis, decision making is the primary component of active learning for the acquisition of topological graph knowledge, whereas idiothetic information is the primary component for metric survey knowledge.",ACCEPTED,,,
57,A Robotic Perceptual System Utilizing Passive Vision and Active Touch,"This paper presents a robotic perceptual system which utilizes passive vision and active touch. The task is one-fingered exploration of a single unmodeled object for apprehension— the determination of the features of the object and the rela tions among them. A two-stage exploration is utilized. Vision is first used in a feedforward manner to segment the object and to obtain its position. Touch is then used in a feedback mode to further explore the object. In designing this system, we have addressed several issues. The first concerns the way in which the robotic perceptual system should be structured. The model which we propose here is based upon theories of human perception. It consists of a highly modularized set of knowledge-based modules, each of which is domain specific and informationally encapsulated. Within the framework of this model, we have designed both vision and touch subsys tems. In each case, we have defined the primitives, features, and representations extracted and created by the system. The visual system is passive and relatively simple. The touch system is active and is an attempt to systematically structure a robotic haptic perception system. Finally, we have ad dressed the issues of how these two subsystems interact dur ing active exploration and how the information from each is integrated. The work described has been implemented and tested on a robot system consisting of a combination tactile array/force-torque sensor, a PUMA robot arm, a pair of CCD cameras, and a Vax 750. © 1988, Sage Publications.

58,Dissociated active and passive tactile shape recognition: a case study of pure tactile apraxia,"Disorders of tactile object recognition (TOR) may result from primary motor or sensory deficits or higher cognitive impairment of tactile shape representations or semantic memory. Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without tactile agnosia, i.e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognition.",REJECTED,6,,
59,Towards active exploration of static and dynamic scene geometry,"In this paper we describe the use of a steerable camera and active vision system in the real-time recovery of trajectories of objects moving on a planar surface in the scene. The system first self-calibrates the transformation from camera platform joint angles to scene plane coordinates by active observation of static scene geometry which has been stored as a model. The transformation is encoded as a homography. When distracted by motion, the camera saccades to the object and subsequently tracks it, and the 2D Cartesian components of the motion trajectory are recovered within the scene plane.",REJECTED,6,,
60,Learning to find spatially reversed sounds,"Adaptation to systematic visual distortions is well-documented but there is little evidence of similar adaptation to radical changes in audition. We use a pseudophone to transpose the sound streams arriving at the left and right ears, evaluating the perceptual effects it provokes and the possibility of learning to locate sounds in the reversed condition. Blindfolded participants remain seated at the center of a semicircular arrangement of 7 speakers and are asked to orient their head towards a sound source. We postulate that a key factor underlying adaptation is the self-generated activity that allows participants to learn new sensorimotor schemes. We investigate passive listening conditions (very short duration stimulus not permitting active exploration) and dynamic conditions (continuous stimulus allowing participants time to freely move their heads or remain still). We analyze head movement kinematics, localization errors, and qualitative reports. Results show movement-induced perceptual disruptions in the dynamic condition with static sound sources displaying apparent movement. This effect is reduced after a short training period and participants learn to find sounds in a left-right reversed field for all but the extreme lateral positions where motor patterns are more restricted. Strategies become less exploratory and more direct with training. Results support the hypothesis that self-generated movements underlie adaptation to radical sensorimotor distortions.",REJECTED,8,,

It argues that perception of media and art is not an exception to how perception works outside of media use. It discusses the idea that perception is a form of bodily work, and not an automatic or passive phenomenon. This position is opposed to the many theories of mind and theories of media that treat perception as something that just happens automatically. It argues that video games exemplify this active perceptual relationship. The chapter discusses films and video games that pose perceptual and enactive challenges for their users. It shows how ecological theories of perception are appropriate for understanding video game play and understanding media use in general.

62,An instance of tactile suppression: Active exploration impairs tactile sensitivity for the direction of lateral movement,"The phenomenon of a reduction in tactile sensitivity during voluntarily executed body movement we call ?tactile suppression?. This is in analogy to saccadic suppression where the visual sensitivity is reduced during voluntarily executed eye movements 1. Here we investigate tactile suppression using an integrated tactile/kinesthetic display consisting of a tactile shear force device 2 mounted on a hyper redundant haptic display (ViSHaRD10 3). To quantify the tactile suppression effect we measured subject?s motion-direction discrimination performance for tactile stimuli moving laterally on the index finger under various active and passive exploration conditions. In the baseline condition (?static?) only tactile stimuli were provided using the shear-force device while the arm was held still. In the ?active? condition subjects had to discriminate the direction of tactile motion while actively executing arm movements at the same time. Finally, in the ?passive? condition the kinesthetic device pas sively moved the subjects? arm, while the subject was performing the discrimination task. Compared to the ?still? condition results indicate a significant decrease of tactile sensibility during active movements whereas passive movements seem to have a minor effect on tactile discrimination performance.",REJECTED,6,,

64,The relative timing of active and passive touch,"Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ACCEPTED,,,
65,Adaptive fuzzy torque control of passive torque servo systems based on small gain theorem and input-to-state stability,"Passive torque servo system (PTSS) simulates aerodynamic load and exerts the load on actuation system, but PTSS endures position coupling disturbance from active motion of actuation system, and this inherent disturbance is called extra torque. The most important issue for PTSS controller design is how to eliminate the influence of extra torque. Using backstepping technique, adaptive fuzzy torque control (AFTC) algorithm is proposed for PTSS in this paper, which reflects the essential characteristics of PTSS and guarantees transient tracking performance as well as final tracking accuracy. Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy logic system is utilized to compensate parametric uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties. The output velocity of actuator identified model is introduced into AFTC aiming to eliminate extra torque. The closed-loop stability is studied using small gain theorem and the control system is proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed AFTC algorithm is applied to an electric load simulator (ELS), and the comparative experimental results indicate that AFTC controller is effective for PTSS. © 2012 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.",REJECTED,6,,

67,Active hair bundle movements in auditory hair cells Mechanoelectrical transduction and adaptation,"The frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing depends on not only the passive mechanics of the basilar membrane but also an active amplification of the mechanical stimulus by the cochlear hair cells. The common view is that amplification stems from the somatic motility of the outer hair cells (OHCs), changes in their length impelled by voltage-dependent transitions in the membrane protein prestin. Whether this voltage-controlled mechanism, whose frequency range may be limited by the membrane time constant, has the band width to cover the entire auditory range of mammals is uncertain. However, there is ample evidence for an alternative mode of force generation by hair cells of non-mammals, such as frogs and turtles, which probably lack prestin. The latter process involves active motion of the hair bundle underpinned by conformational changes in the mechanotransducer (MT) channels and activation of one or more isoforms of myosin. This review summarizes evidence for active hair bundle motion and its connection to MT channel adaptation. Key factors for the hair bundle motor to play a role in the mammalian cochlea include the size and speed of force production.",REJECTED,4,,
68,Study on visuo-tactile sensory integration in shape perception,"Experiments on adaptation to distorted visual and tactile rectangles were carried out to investigate interactions between visuo-tactile sensory integration and active perception in shape perception. The interactions have two aspects: the effects of active perception on sensory integration and the effects of sensory integration on active perception. Therefore, the first part of this paper discusses sensory integration with active and passive touch, and the second part discusses the changes of active touch finger movement in the sensory integration process. During the experiments, cross-modal reaction tests were held to evaluate adaptation to the vertical/horizontal ratio of shapes. Amount of sensory integration was estimated by this evaluation. There are two features of sensory integration with active touch: perception with voluntary finger movement and perception with synchronized visual and tactile information. Therefore, comparisons were made first between adaptation experiments with voluntary touch and that with passive touch, and secondly among that with successive visual and tactile stimulation, that with concurrent stimulation, and that with concurrent stimulation with visualized finger movement which strengthened the synchronization. The first comparison showed that adaptation of subjects with voluntary touch was greater than that of those with passive touch. The second comparison showed that adaptation was enhanced by visualized finger movement. Thus, voluntariness and intermodal synchronization of active perception were important factors in sensory integration. In these adaptation experiments, the finger movements by which the subjects actively obtain tactile information of shapes were measured by PSD camera. From position data of the finger, maximum velocities of movement were calculated, and the finger movement system was identified by applying ARMA model. When subjects were exposed to visual and tactile information concurrently either with or without visualized finger movement, maximum velocities of finger movement increased as the experiment proceed. In order to observe changes in finger movement systems, simulations of identified systems were performed. Simulated step responses of finger movement showed that rise time shortened as the experiment proceeded. These results suggested that sensory integration causes a quick response of active touch to visual information. Sensory integration and active perception interact effectively.",ACCEPTED,,,

The purpose of this study was to measure long finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon excursion during active and passive movement using high-resolution ultrasound images. Methods: The FDP tendon excursion was measured at the wrist level in 10 healthy subjects during full tip-to-palm active and passive flexion of the fingers. Passive movement was performed 2 ways: (1) straight to full fist: passive flexion starting at the metacarpophalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joint flexion; and (2) hook to full fist: passive flexion starting at the distal interphalangeal joint, followed by proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion. Tendon excursion was measured using an in-house-developed, frame-to-frame analysis of high-resolution ultrasound images. Results: Median FDP excursion was 24.3 mm, 14.0 mm, and 13.6 mm for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Tendon excursions during active movements was significantly larger than excursions during passive movements (p = .005). The adjusted median tendon excursion was 12.7 mm/100°, 7.5 mm/100°, and 7.4 mm/100° for active fist, straight to full fist, and hook to full fist movements, respectively. Adjusted tendon excursions during active movement were significantly larger than those achieved during passive straight to full fist movement). Adjusted tendon excursions during straight to full fist movements were significantly larger than those achieved during passive hook to full fist movement. Conclusions: Active motion produced 74% and 79% increases in excursions compared to both passive motions in healthy controls. The study results can serve as a reference for evaluating excursions in patients with tendon pathology, including those who have had tendon repair and reconstruction. © 2010 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.",REJECTED,2,,
71,Single unit analysis of the human ventral thalamic nuclear group: Activity correlated with movement,"During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells). The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response). The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement.Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg. Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body. Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87). Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells). Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields. Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell. Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint. The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",REJECTED,6,,

Before and after rTMS, 1.5 T fMRI was examined during simple hand movements. While in the pilot study the rTMS coil was navigated over the SI cortex with a maximum of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal induced by passive movement, patients in the advanced study had the coil above the postcentral sulcus. RESULTS: After real-rTMS, 4 pilot study patients and 10 advanced study patients experienced subjective and objective improvement in writing, while only minimal changes were observed after sham-rTMS. Patients involved in the active movement task exhibited a rTMS-induced BOLD signal increase bilaterally in the SI cortex, posterior parietal cortex and in the supplementary motor area (p<0.001 corrected). After sham-rTMS, no BOLD signal changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1 Hz rTMS of the SI cortex can improve writer's cramp while increasing the cortical activity in both hemispheres. Handwriting improved in most patients, as well as the subjective benefit, and lasted for 2-3 weeks. The beneficial effects of rTMS paralleled the functional reorganization in the SI cortex and connected areas, reflecting the impact of somatosensory system on active motion control. ©2010 Neuroendocrinology Letters.",REJECTED,6,,
73,The Compass Elbow Hinge: Indications and initial results,"The Compass Elbow Hinge uses Illizarov's methods of fixation to externally hold the elbow reduced and allow both passive and active motion. Eleven patients with degenerative disease, contracture or instability were treated with the Compass Elbow Hinge and were retrospectively evaluated at an average follow-up of 29 months (range: 18-62 months). One was lost to follow-up. Patients with degenerative changes underwent fascia lata interposition while those treated for contractures underwent anterior and posterior capsular release with or without fascia lata interposition. Those with elbow instability underwent ligament reconstruction. The device was removed after 6 weeks and seven of the 11 patients were satisfied with the outcome of the operation. Stability could not be achieved in two patients with coronoid fractures that were not reconstructed. One patient did not tolerate the device and requested its removal with subsequent subluxation. We conclude that patient selection and compliance are key elements in achieving a satisfactory outcome with the device.",REJECTED,6,,
74,Spinal fractures: a clinico-radiographic approach,"Purpose:  To review the radiology of spinal fractures and purpose seed clinical pathways for determining the appropriateness of radiology of spinal trauma patients likely to present in chiropractic offices.  Implications of appropriateness and timing of manipulation in spinal fractures are discussed.  Method:  A qualitative literature review was conducted, supplemented with clinical case review from files at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic Radiology Department.  Summary:  Peak incidence of spinal fracture occurs in the young adult population with a male prevalence.  However, females are predisposed to spinal fracture in the older population.  The lumbosacral spine is the most frequent site for spinal fracture and is usually associated with falls and motor vehicle accidents.  The nature of fracture is likely to induce characteristic changes in the anterior, middle and posterior spinal column regions, serving as a guide for evaluating the radiograph.  Adjustive methods may be appropriate in the posttraumatic therapeutic regimen depending on the nature and severity of trauma, the degree of healing, the amount of initial and residual deformation, and the neurologic status of the patient.  An approach of passive and active movements of gradually increasing intensity may be therapeutically beneficial.",REJECTED,4,,
75,Management of shoulder deformities in brachial plexus birth palsies,"Background: During the last century, there has been growing evidence that dislocation of the glenohumeral joint in children commonly occurs with brachial plexus birth palsy, often in the first year of life. Etiology: Permanent injuries to the brachial plexus in childhood create a muscle imbalance about the shoulder during the reinnervation process. This results in an internal rotation contracture, external rotation weakness, and subsequent glenoid retroversion, posterior deficiency, joint subluxation, and eventual dislocation. Evaluation: On physical examination with scapular stabilization, there is limited passive external rotation in adduction and abduction. Ultrasounds, arthrograms, and magnetic resonance imaging help in evaluating the deformity of glenohumeral deformity and dislocation. At present magnetic resonance imaging is the standard on which operative intervention is based. Treatment: Initial treatment is physical therapy with passive glenohumeral mobilization with scapular stabilization. Failure to regain or maintain passive external rotation and evidence of joint instability or dislocation on examination are indicators for for futher evaluation and intervention. Nonsurgical interventions such as Botox injections, or splinting or SPICA cast may be considered. Ultimately, contracture release, potential joint reduction, and extra-articular muscle transfer surgery has been the standard of care, though there is ongoing debate regarding whether release alone is sufficient. It is important not to overlengthen the subscapularis or over release the glenohumeral joint, which can cause loss of internal rotation power and development of external rotation contracture. Outcomes: Early operative intervention in the form of extra-articular rebalancing techniques has become the standard of care, providing the best opportunity for enhanced motion and function, and improved validated Mallet, Active Movement, and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument scores. Long-term improvements in outcome may rest on joint remodeling by arthroscopic or open reduction, though further research is still required to evaluate remodeling of joints over the course of a lifetime. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",REJECTED,7,,

Recall of object locations was more accurate in the active compared to passive condition.

A new computer-controlled device - the tactile display system (TDS) - has been developed to deal with this problem. The TDS tracks an ‘active’ subject’s fingertip movements during exploration of a raised line drawing and digitally records this spatio-temporal information. It then guides a passive participant’s fingertip over the same path, matching for location and speed. Any difference in performance can thus be attributed to the different conditions (active versus passive) because other variables are held constant.",ACCEPTED,,Yes,

Also, it has an inseparable relation with the motion. Thus, this study tried to analyze the breathing structure of a Han, Sungjun style of Taepyeongmu (Peace Dance) motion, extract breathing patterns and features from the analysis and explore them, analyze the dance more scientifically and objectively and understand its substance. If 1 say the result here first, it can be summarized as follows.  First, analyzing the breathing structure of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim by the breathing notation of inhalation, exhalation and stop showed that Episode Tubullim one breath(twice), two breaths(four times), three breaths(eight times) and four breaths(nine times) of tenfold time.  Secondly, exploring the percentages accounted for by Episode Tubullim Quantifying them in detail showed that inhalation appeared 75 tines, exhalation 81 times and stop 12 times. In particular, the various changes of inhalation and exhalation here revealing the technical aspects of Taepyeongmu dance motion highlighted indicated that they became the origin for the dance whose dynamicity is emphasized together with the static taste of stop breathing.  Thirdly, extracting and analyzing the breathing pattern of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim showed that most of Episode Tubullim consisted variously of big, middle and small breaths. But not only a breath line of symmetrical inhalation and exhalation according to the techniques of the breaths but also a vertical sign expressive of stop caused two aspects of asymmetrical transformed breath lines.  Fourthly, analyzing and arranging the episode-specific feature of a Taepyeongmu dance Episode Tubullim in connection with the breathing pattern of its motion showed that Episode Tubullim had bow-shaped, crane-shaped, and brush-shaped dancing motions from long and deep breaths through short and shallow breaths with progressive speed to breath lines of dot, line and circle by the techniques of fastening, tightrope dancing and unfastening.  In particular, crane-shaped and bow-shaped dancing motions which were very soft, technical and dynamic formed the mainstream of the dance at that time.

80,Multimodal integration of self-motion cues in the vestibular system: Active versus passive translations,"The ability to keep track of where we are going as we navigate through our environment requires knowledge of our ongoing location and orientation. In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion. © 2013 the authors.",REJECTED,6,,

On the basis of what Descartes says there (and in the Passions of the Soul), I distinguish two ways in which the Cartesian perceiver might be thought to be passive. I shall call these two senses of passivity, respectively, passivity simpliciter and non-volitional passivity. This paper will examine and assess the arguments for and against the claims that the Cartesian agent is both passive simpliciter and non-volitionally passive.",REJECTED,4,,
82,Plasticity of cerebellar purkinje cells in behavioral training of body balance control,"Neural responses to sensory inputs caused by self-generated movements (reafference) and external passive stimulation (exafference) differ in various brain regions. The ability to differentiate such sensory information can lead to movement execution with better accuracy. However, how sensory responses are adjusted in regard to this distinguishability during motor learning is still poorly understood. The cerebellum has been hypothesized to analyze the functional significance of sensory information during motor learning, and is thought to be a key region of reafference computation in the vestibular system. In this study, we investigated Purkinje cell (PC) spike trains as cerebellar cortical output when rats learned to balance on a suspended dowel. Rats progressively reduced the amplitude of body swing and made fewer foot slips during a 5-min balancing task. Both PC simple (SSs; 17 of 26) and complex spikes (CSs; 7 of 12) were found to code initially on the angle of the heads with respect to a fixed reference. Using periods with comparable degrees of movement, we found that such SS coding of information in most PCs (10 of 17) decreased rapidly during balance learning. In response to unexpected perturbations and under anesthesia, SS coding capability of these PCs recovered. By plotting SS and CS firing frequencies over 15-s time windows in double-logarithmic plots, a negative correlation between SS and CS was found in awake, but not anesthetized, rats. PCs with prominent SS coding attenuation during motor learning showed weaker SS-CS correlation. Hence, we demonstrate that neural plasticity for filtering out sensory reafference from active motion occurs in the cerebellar cortex in rats during balance learning. SS-CS interaction may contribute to this rapid plasticity as a form of receptive field plasticity in the cerebellar cortex between two receptive maps of sensory inputs from the external world and of efference copies from the will center for volitional movements.",REJECTED,6,,
83,Similar mechanisms underlie curvature comparison by static and dynamic touch,"In four experiments, we tested whether haptic comparison of curvature ranging from -4/m to +4/m is qualitatively the same for static and for dynamic touch. In Experiments 1 and 3, we tested whether static and dynamic curvature discrimination are based on height differences, attitude (slope) differences, curvature differences, or a combination of these geometrical variables. It was found that both static and dynamic haptic curvature discrimination are based on attitude differences. In Experiments 2 and 4, we tested whether this mechanism leads to errors in the comparison of stimuli with different lengths for static and dynamic touch, respectively. If the judgments are based on attitude differences, subjects will make systematic errors in these comparisons. In both experiments, we found that subjects compared the curvatures of strips of the same length veridically, whereas they made systematic errors if they were required to compare the curvatures of strips of different lengths. Longer stimuli were judged to be more curved than shorter stimuli with the same curvature. We conclude that similar mechanisms underlie static and dynamic haptic curvature comparison. Moreover, additional data comparison showed that static and dynamic curvature comparison is not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively similar.",ACCEPTED,,,
84,Brainstem processing of vestibular sensory exafference: Implications for motion sickness etiology,"The origin of the internal ""sensory conflict"" stimulus causing motion sickness has been debated for more than four decades. Recent studies show a subclass of neurons in the vestibular nuclei and deep cerebellar nuclei that respond preferentially to passive head movements. During active movement, the semicircular canal and otolith input (""reafference"") to these neurons are canceled by a mechanism comparing the expected consequences of self-generated movement (estimated with an internal model-presumably located in the cerebellum) with the actual sensory feedback. The un-canceled component (""exafference"") resulting from passive movement normally helps compensate for unexpected postural disturbances. Notably, the existence of such vestibular ""sensory conflict"" neurons had been postulated as early as 1982, but their existence and putative role in posture control and motion sickness have been long debated. Here, we review the development of ""sensory conflict"" theories in relation to recent evidence for brainstem and cerebellar reafference cancelation, and identify some open research questions. We propose that conditions producing persistent activity of these neurons, or their targets, stimulate nearby brainstem emetic centers-via an as yet unidentified mechanism. We discuss how such a mechanism is consistent with the notable difference in motion sickness susceptibility of drivers as opposed to passengers, human immunity to normal self-generated movement and why head restraint or lying horizontal confers relative immunity. Finally, we propose that fuller characterization of these mechanisms and their potential role in motion sickness could lead to more effective, scientifically based prevention and treatment for motion sickness. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",REJECTED,4,,
85,"Flexor tendon injuries of hand: experience at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan.","BACKGROUND: Flexor tendon injury is one of the most common hand injuries. This initial treatment is of the utmost importance because it often determines the final outcome; inadequate primary treatment is likely to give poor long tem results. Various suture techniques have been devised for tendon repair but the modified Kessler's technique is the most commonly used. This study was conducted in order to know the cause, mechanism and the effects of early controlled mobilization after flexor tendon repair and to assess the range of active motion after flexor tendon repair in hand. METHODS: This study was conducted at the department of Plastic Surgery, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad from 1st March 2002 to 31st August 2003. Only adult patients of either sex with an acute injury were included in whom primary or delayed primary tendon repair was undertaken. In all the patients, modified Kessler's technique was used for the repair using non-absorbable monofilament (Prolene 4-0). The wound was closed with interrupted non-absorbable, polyfilament (Silk 4-0) suture. A dorsal splint extending beyond the finger tip to proximal forearm was used with wrist in 20-30 degrees palmer flexion, metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint flexed at 60 degrees. Passive movements of fingers were started from the first post operative day, and for controlled, active movements, a dynamic splint was applied. RESULTS: During this study, 33 patients with 39 digits were studies. 94% of the patients had right dominated hand involvement. 51% had the complete flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) injuries. Middle and ring fingers were most commonly involved. Thumb was involved in 9% of the patients. Zone III(46%) was the commonest to be involved followed by zone II (28%). Laceration with sharp object was the most frequent cause of injury. Finger tip to distal palmer crease distance (TPD) was < 2.0 cm in 71% cases (average 2.4cm) at the end of 2nd postoperative week. Total number of patients was 34 at the end of 6th week. TPD was < 2.0 cm in 55% patients and < 1.0 cm in 38% cases (average 1.5cm) at the end of 6th week. Total 9 patients were lost to the follow up at the end of 8th week. TPD was < 1.0 cm in 67% (average 0.9 cm) at the end of 8th postoperative week. No case of disruption of repair was noted during the study. CONCLUSION: Early active mobilization programme is essential after tendon repair.

86,Achronopresence: how temporal visuotactile and visuomotor mismatches modulate embodiment,"The loss of body ownership, the feeling that your body and its limbs no longer belong to you, presents a severe clinical condition that has proven difficult to study directly. We here propose a novel paradigm using mixed reality to interfere with natural embodiment using temporally conflicting sensory signals from the own hand. In Experiment 1 we investigated how such a mismatch affects phenomenological and physiological aspects of embodiment, and identified its most important dimensions using a principle component analysis. The results suggest that such a mismatch induces a strong reduction in embodiment accompanied by an increase in feelings of disownership and deafference, which was, however, not reflected in physiological changes. In Experiment 2 we refined the paradigm to measure perceptual thresholds for temporal mismatches and compared how different multimodal, mismatching information alters the sense of embodiment. The results showed that while visual delay decreased embodiment both while actively moving and during passive touch, the effect was stronger for the former. Our results extend previous findings as they demonstrate that a sense of disembodiment can be induced through controlled multimodal mismatches about one’s own body and more so during active movement as compared to passive touch. Based on the ecologically more valid protocol we propose here, we argue that such a sense of disembodiment may fundamentally differ from disownership sensations as discussed in the rubber hand illusion literature, and emphasize its clinical relevance. This might importantly advance the current debate on the relative contribution of different modalities to our sense of body and its plasticity.",REJECTED,8,,
87,Transfer of the curvature aftereffect in dynamic touch,"A haptic curvature aftereffect is a phenomenon in which the perception of a curved shape is systematically altered by previous contact to curvature. In the present study, the existence and intermanual transfer of curvature aftereffects for dynamic touch were investigated. Dynamic touch is characterized by motion contact between a finger and a stimulus. A distinction was made between active and passive contact of the finger on the stimulus surface. We demonstrated the occurrence of a dynamic curvature aftereffect and found a complete intermanual transfer of this aftereffect, which suggests that dynamically obtained curvature information is represented at a high level. In contrast, statically perceived curvature information is mainly processed at a level that is connected to a single hand, as previous studies indicated. Similar transfer effects were found for active and passive dynamic touch, but a stronger aftereffect was obtained when the test surface was actively touched. We conclude that the representation of object information depends on the exploration mode that is used to acquire information. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",ACCEPTED,,,

91,Dynamic alterations in chemokine gradients induce transendothelial shuttling of human T cells under physiologic shear conditions,"The active movement of cells from subendothelial compartments into the bloodstream (intravasation) has been recognized for several decades by histologic and physiologic studies, yet the molecular effectors of this process are relatively uncharacterized. For extravasation, studies based predominantly on static transwell assays support a general model, whereby transendothelial migration (TEM) occurs via chemoattraction toward increasing chemokine concentrations. However, this model of chemotaxis cannot readily reconcile how chemokines influence intravasation, as shear forces of blood flow would likely abrogate luminal chemokine gradient(s). Thus, to analyze how T cells integrate perivascular chemokine signals under physiologic flow, we developed a novel transwell-based flow chamber allowing for real-time modulation of chemokine levels above (luminal/apical compartment) and below (abluminal/subendothelial compartment) HUVEC monolayers. We routinely observed human T cell TEM across HUVEC monolayers with the combination of luminal CXCL12 and abluminal CCL5. With increasing concentrations of CXCL12 in the luminal compartment, transmigrated T cells did not undergo retrograde transendothelial migration (retro-TEM). However, when exposedto abluminal CXCL12, transmigrated T cells underwent striking retro-TEM and re-entered the flow stream [corrected]. This CXCL12 fugetactic (chemorepellant) effect was concentration-dependent, augmented by apical flow, blocked by antibodies to integrins, and reduced by AMD3100 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CXCL12-induced retro-TEM was inhibited by PI3K antagonism and cAMP agonism. These findings broaden our understanding of chemokine biology and support a novel paradigm by which temporospatial modulations in subendothelial chemokine display drive cell migration from interstitial compartments into the bloodstream.",REJECTED,5,,
92,Dynamic cutaneous information is sufficient for precise curvature discrimination,"Our tactual perceptual experiences occur when we interact, actively and passively, with environmental objects and surfaces. Previous research has demonstrated that active manual exploration often enhances the tactual perception of object shape. Nevertheless, the factors that contribute to this enhancement are not well understood. The present study evaluated the ability of 28 younger (mean age was 23.1 years) and older adults (mean age was 71.4 years) to discriminate curved surfaces by actively feeling objects with a single index finger and by passively feeling objects that moved relative to a restrained finger. While dynamic cutaneous stimulation was therefore present in both conditions, active exploratory movements only occurred in one. The results indicated that there was a significant and large effect of age, such that the older participants' thresholds were 43.8 percent higher than those of the younger participants. Despite the overall adverse effect of age, the pattern of results across the active and passive touch conditions was identical. For both age groups, the curvature discrimination thresholds obtained for passive touch were significantly lower than those that occurred during active touch. Curvature discrimination performance was therefore best in the current study when dynamic cutaneous stimulation occurred in the absence of active movement.",ACCEPTED,,,
93,Both stiff and compliant: Morphological and biomechanical adaptations of stick insect antennae for tactile exploration,"Active tactile exploration behaviour is constrained to a large extent by the morphological and biomechanical properties of the animal's somatosensory system. In the model organism Carausius morosus, the main tactile sensory organs are long, thin, seemingly delicate, but very robust antennae. Previous studies have shown that these antennae are compliant under contact, yet stiff enough to maintain a straight shape during active exploration. Overcritical damping of the flagellum, on the other hand, allows for a rapid return to the straight shape after release of contact. Which roles do the morphological and biomechanical adaptations of the flagellum play in determining these special mechanical properties? To investigate this question, we used a combination of biomechanical experiments and numerical modelling. A set of four finite-element (FE) model variants was derived to investigate the effect of the distinct geometrical and material properties of the flagellum on its static (bending) and dynamic (damping) characteristics. The results of our numerical simulations show that the tapered shape of the flagellum had the strongest influence on its static biomechanical behaviour. The annulated structure and thickness gradient affected the deformability of the flagellum to a lesser degree. The inner endocuticle layer of the flagellum was confirmed to be essential for explaining the strongly damped return behaviour of the antenna. By highlighting the significance of two out of the four main structural features of the insect flagellum, our study provides a basis for mechanical design of biomimetic touch sensors tuned to become maximally flexible while quickly resuming a straight shape after contact.",REJECTED,6,,
94,Modality-specific and amodal aspects of object perception in infancy: The case of active touch,"Three experiments investigated 4.5-month-old infants' perception of the unity and boundaries of haptically presented objects. When infants actively explored the two handles of an unseen object assembly, perception of the unity of the assembly depended on the handles' motion. Infants perceived a single, connected object if the handles moved rigidly together, and they perceived two distinct objects if the handles underwent relative vertical or horizontal motion. When infants passively explored the same object assembly undergoing the same motions, object perception appeared to be indeterminate. The findings of the active motion experiments accord with the findings of studies of visual object perception and suggest that object perception depends on amodal processes, operating on representations of either seen or felt surface motions. The findings of the passive motion experiments nevertheless suggest a difference between visual and haptic perception: for infants as for adults, haptic perception is enhanced by the active production of surface motion. © 1993.",REJECTED,7,,
95,Regional differences intaste responsiveness: Effect of stimulus andtasting mode,"Previous studies have shown that there are differences in taste responses between various regions of the tongue. Most of those studies used a controlled “passive” tasting mode due to the nature of investigation. However, food is rarely tasted in a passive manner. In addition, recent studies have suggested that humans can taste maltooligosaccharides (MOS) and that the gustatory detection of MOS is independent of the known sweet receptor. It is unknown whether regional differences in responsiveness to MOS exist. This study was set up to revisit previous work by investigating the effects of tasting mode (“passive” vs. “active”) on regional differences in taste responsiveness to sucrose, monopotassium glutamate (MPG), and quinine, while also investigating potential regional differences in responsiveness to MOS. The stimuli were applied to 1 of 4 target areas, the left and right sides of the front and back of the tongue, using cotton-tipped swabs. In the passive tasting condition, the front of the tongue was found to be more responsive to both sucrose and MOS, but no regional differences were seen for quinine and MPG. In contrast, in the active tasting condition, the back of the tongue was found to be more responsive to quinine and MPG, but no differences were found for sucrose or MOS. These findings indicate that there are regional differences in taste responsiveness between the front and back of the tongue and that regional responsiveness is dependent on stimulus and tasting mode.",ACCEPTED,,,

The use of these cues can be compromised in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids. Purpose: To determine how age, hearing impairment, and the use of hearing aids affect a listener's ability to determine front from back based on both self-motion and spectral cues. Research Design: We used a previously published front/back illusion: signals whose physical source location is rotated around the head at twice the angular rate of the listener's head movements are perceptually located in the opposite hemifield from where they physically are. In normal-hearing listeners, the strength of this illusion decreases as a function of low-pass filter cutoff frequency, this is the result of a conflict between spectral cues and dynamic binaural cues for sound source location. The illusion was used as an assay of self-motion processing in listeners with hearing impairment and users of hearing aids. Study Sample: We recruited 40 hearing-impaired participants, with an average age of 62 yr. The data for three listeners were discarded because they did not move their heads enough during the experiment. Data Collection and Analysis: Listeners sat at the center of a ring of 24 loudspeakers, turned their heads back and forth, and used a wireless keypad to report the front/back location of statically presented signals and of dynamically moving signals with illusory locations. Front/back accuracy for static signals, the strength of front/back illusions, and minimum audible movement angle were measured for each listener in each condition. All measurements were made in each listener both aided and unaided. Results: Hearing-impaired listeners were less accurate at front/back discrimination for both static and illusory conditions. Neither static nor illusory conditions were affected by high-frequency content. Hearing aids had heterogeneous effects from listener to listener, but independent of other factors, on average, listeners wearing aids exhibited a spectrally dependent increase in ""front"" responses: the more high-frequency energy in the signal, the more likely they were to report it as coming from the front. Conclusions: Hearing impairment was associated with a decrease in the accuracy of self-motion processing for both static and moving signals. Hearing aids may not always reproduce dynamic self-motion-related cues with sufficient fidelity to allow reliable front/back discrimination.",REJECTED,6,,
97,Improvement of hand function in African Americans with scleroderma: Use of a hand continuous passive motion,Introduction: Movement in the hands is essential to daily functional activities however persons with Scleroderma are at high risk for loosing this function which can lead to loss of independence. It is therefore essential that rehabilitation healthcare professionals work to maintain hand function in these individuals so that independent living can continue while living with this disease and that a good quality of life can be preserved. Subjects: Three African American individuals who were diagnosed with Scleroderma and had hand involvement were assessed for hand function and given standard exercise program. Methods: Active range of motion (ROM) was performed on bilateral wrists and hands and the Arthritis Hand Function Test (AHFT) was performed. Each individual was instructed to participate in a daily active motion exercise program for both hands. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine was placed on the right hand of each individual and the left hand received no CPM intervention. The Arthritis Hand Function Test was also administered. Each individual wore the CPM at night from 2-4 hours on the right hand only. Measurements were taken after at least four weeks of CPM for comparison. The medical records of these individuals were reviewed for this study. Results: Two of the subjects gained greater than 60 degrees of total active movement of the digits on the hand that received the CPM as compared to the hand that had only active exercise. The other subject gained more active movement in the hand that did not have CPM treatment but did have daily active exercise. All of the subjects had improvement in the AHFT. Significance: This pilot study shows that improvement in hand function can improve with intervention addressing motion of the hands. Whether active motion alone or active motion with the addition of continuous passive motion is optimal treatment intervention is not clear. This pilot should provide a basis for further research into which is the best treatment for individuals at risk of losing hand function and independence.,REJECTED,6,,
98,Dynamic Control of Robot Perception Using Stochastic Spatial Models,"Robot perception has traditionally been addressed as a passive and incidental activity, rather than an active and task-directed activity. Consequently, although sensor systems are essential to provide the information required by the decision-making and actuation components of a robot system, no explicit planning and control of the sensory activities of the robot is performed. This has lead to the development of sensor modules that are either excessively specialized, or inefficient and unfocused in their informational output. In this paper, we develop strategies for the dynamic control of robot perception, using stochastic sensor and spatial models to explicitly plan and control the sensory activities of an autonomous mobile robot, and to dynamically servo the robot and its sensors to acquire the information necessary for successful execution of robot tasks. We discuss the explicit characterization of robot task-specific information requirements, the use of information-theoretic measures to model the extent, accuracy and complexity of the robot’s world model, and the representation of inferences about the robot’s environment using the Inference Grid, a multi- property tesselated random field model. We describe the use of stochastic sensor models to determine the utility of sensory actions, and to compute the loci of observation of relevant information. These models allow the development of various perception control strategies, including attention control and focussing, perceptual responsiveness to varying spatial complexity, and control of multi-goal perceptual activities. We illustrate these methodologies using an autonomous multi-sensor mobile robot, and show the application of dynamic perception strategies to active exploration and multi-objective motion planning.",REJECTED,4,,
99,Analysis and Synthesis of Underactuated Compliant Mechanisms Based on Transmission Properties of Motion and Force,"This article analyzes and designs the transmission structure for underactuated compliant mechanisms (UCMs). The transmission structure of UCMs consists of serial and parallel transmission chains. At first, the UCMs are classified systematically according to the number and distribution of the serial and parallel transmissions. Next, the active and passive transmission properties of motion and force in UCMs are analyzed on the defined four subspaces of tangent and cotangent spaces of joint space. Synthesizing the classification and the transmission properties of UCMs, the congruent relationship between mechanical structure and transmission function is established, and different cases of UCMs are discussed and compared. A novel type of UCMs can achieve the independent regulation of passive stiffness, active force, and active motion that is useful for improving the transmission performance in robotic and prosthetic hands. Finally, a functional oriented design method is proposed and used to design a single-actuator two-fingered gripper for enveloping and precision grasps. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",REJECTED,6,,
100,Rapid increases in ventilation accompany the transition from passive to active movement,"We used a novel movement transition technique to look for evidence of a rapid onset drive to breathe related to the active component of exercise in humans. Ten volunteers performed the following transitions in a specially designed tandem exercise chair apparatus: rest to passive movement, passive to active movement, and rest to active movement. The transition from rest to active exercise was accompanied by an immediate increase in ventilation, as was the transition from rest to passive leg movement (Δ = 6.06 ± 1.09 l min-1, p < 0.001 and Δ = 3.30 ± 0.57 l min-1, p = 0.002, respectively). When subjects actively assumed the leg movements, ventilation again increased immediately and significantly (Δ = 2.55 ± 0.52 l min-1, p = 0.032). Ventilation at the first point of active exercise was the same when started either from rest or from a background of passive leg movement (p = 1.00). We conclude that the use of a transition from passive to active leg movements in humans recruits a ventilatory drive related to the active component of exercise, and this can be discerned as a rapid increase in breathing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
