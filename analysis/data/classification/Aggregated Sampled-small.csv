Title,Abstract
Short psychotherapy in the treatment of psychosomatic vascular disorders,"Essential hypertension is one of the most frequent vascular and most typical psychosomatic diseases. The casual therapy is psychotherapy in a form of a short analysis dynamically oriented. This paper deals with the method and results obtained by short psychotherapy of 60 patients with essential hypertension, aged between 23 and 54. The therapeutic procedure is directed to the patients and to the patient-therapist conflict and interaction. The autopsychic conflict of not being able to invest a whole personality into the task of treatment was revealed in each patient. If free associations were manifested in the patient, the further treatment was aimed at revealing symptomatology and actual conflicts. Dispositions with aggressive tendencies were psychoreactively discovered, whereas, as relates the characters, those patients were extremely gay and vital personalities. The therapist's attitude kept varying from a passive listening to an active perceiving of emotional oscillations, never being that of a transfer neurosis. In achieving a therapeutical goal, a positive motivation was proved to be significant. Only in four patients the failure in treatment was due to a negative motivation and inability to choose a substitute. Although the estimation of short psychotherapy outcome based on the improvement of symptoms in essential hypertension has not been scientifically confirmed, it cannot be refuted as well, because each positive outcome is considered useful for the patient."
Research on environmental cognition architecture for intelligent mobile robots,"According to environmental cognition theory, a real bottom-up behavior-based environmental cognition architecture, in which ″sensory-action″ is taken as cognitive primitives is presented. Perception procedure of robot on the environment changes from the partial, discrete, passive sensing way to the global, continuous, active perceiving way. Environmental cognition is the result of the memory process of direct perceptional experiences. ″Autonomous distributed representation″ is proposed for representing the spatio-temporal experiences. The mechanism of the communication and learning between various levels is discussed, to form stimulus-response subsumption mechanism finally."
Life Log visualization system based on informationally structured space for supporting elderly people,"This paper proposes human behavior perception compound between passive perception and active perception. Human behavior is stored in a database for creating the life log to realize visualization system for supporting elderly people using iPad. First, we discuss the life log system configuration based on informationally structured space. We apply sensor network and smart phone for measuring human behavior to realize passive perception, and we also apply conversation system for conducting communication between robot partner and human to realize active perception. Next, we explain the database system that constructs informationally structured space. The cloud database is used to share the elderly people's life log information with the elderly people's family and caregivers through the visualization system. Finally, we discuss the usability of the Visualization System through experimental results. © 2013 IEEE."
Active touch for robust perception under position uncertainty,"In this paper, we propose that active perception will help attain autonomous robotics in unstructured environments by giving robust perception. We test this claim with a biomimetic fingertip that senses surface texture under a range of contact depths. We compare the performance of passive Bayesian perception with a novel approach for active perception that includes a sensorimotor loop for controlling sensor position. Passive perception at a single depth gave poor results, with just 0.2mm uncertainty impairing performance. Extending passive perception over a range of depths gave non-robust performance. Only active perception could give robust, accurate performance, with the sensorimotor feedback compensating the position uncertainty. We expect that these results will extend to other stimuli, so that active perception will offer a general approach to robust perception in unstructured environments. © 2013 IEEE."
Descartes and Active Perception,"In this paper, I argue that Descartes’ own characterization of sensory perception as given above is somewhat misleading. It does not fully reflect the active role that the Cartesian perceiver plays in organizing and constructing her own sensory perceptions. My paper begins by examining Descartes’ proof of the existence of the external world in the Sixth Meditation. On the basis of what Descartes says there (and in the Passions of the Soul), I distinguish two ways in which the Cartesian perceiver might be thought to be passive. I shall call these two senses of passivity, respectively, passivity simpliciter and non-volitional passivity. This paper will examine and assess the arguments for and against the claims that the Cartesian agent is both passive simpliciter and non-volitionally passive."
On the relative complexity of active vs. passive visual search,"Here, this author attempts to tie the concept of active perception to attentive processing in general and to the complexity level analysis of visual search described previously; the aspects of active vision as they have been currently described form a subset of the full spectrum of attentional capabilities. Our approach is motivated by the search requirements of vision tasks and thus we cast the problem as one of search preceding the application of methods for shape-from-X, optical flow, etc., and recognition in general. This perspective permits a dimension of analysis not found in current formulations of the active perception problem, that of computational complexity. This article describes where the active perception paradigm does and does not provide computational benefits along this dimension. A formalization of the search component of active perception is presented in order to accomplish this. The link to attentional mechanisms is through the control of data acquisition and processing by the active process. It should be noted that the analysis performed here applies to the general hypothesize-and-test search strategy, to time-varying scenes as well as to the general problem of integration of successive fixations. Finally, an argument is presented as to why this framework is an extension of the behaviorist approaches to active vision. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers."
Active force perception depends on cerebellar function,"Damage to the cerebellum causes characteristic movement abnormalities but is thought to have minimal impact on somatosensory perception. Traditional clinical assessments of patients with cerebellar lesions reveal no perceptual deficits despite the fact that the cerebellum receives substantial somatosensory information. Given that abnormalities have been reported in predicting the visual consequences of movement, we suspect that the cerebellum broadly participates in perception when motor output is required (i.e., active perception). Thus we hypothesize that cerebellar integrity is essential for somatosensory perception that requires motor activity, but not passive somatosensory perception. We compared the perceptual acuity of human cerebellar patients to that of healthy control subjects in several different somatosensory perception tasks with minimal visual information. We found that patients were worse at active force and stiffness discrimination but similar to control subjects with regard to passive cutaneous force detection, passive proprioceptive detection, and passive proprioceptive discrimination. Furthermore, the severity of movement symptoms as assessed by a clinical exam was positively correlated with impairment of active force perception. Notably, within the context of these perceptual tasks, control subjects and cerebellar patients displayed similar movement characteristics, and hence differing movement strategies are unlikely to underlie the differences in perception. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is vital to sensory prediction of self-generated movement and suggest a general role for the cerebellum in multiple forms of active perception. © 2012 the American Physiological Society."
Microsaccades for neuromorphic stereo vision,"Depth perception through stereo vision is an important feature of biological and artificial vision systems. While biological systems can compute disparities effortlessly, it requires intensive processing for artificial vision systems. The computing complexity resides in solving the correspondence problem – finding matching pairs of points in the two eyes. Inspired by the retina, event-based vision sensors allow a new constraint to solve the correspondence problem: time. Relying on precise spike-time, spiking neural networks can take advantage of this constraint. However, disparities can only be computed from dynamic environments since event-based vision sensors only report local changes in light intensity. In this paper, we show how microsaccadic eye movements can be used to compute disparities from static environments. To this end, we built a robotic head supporting two Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capable of independent panning and simultaneous tilting. We evaluate the method on both static and dynamic scenes perceived through microsaccades. This paper demonstrates the complementarity of event-based vision sensors and active perception leading to more biologically inspired robots."
Active visual perception for mobile robot localization,"Localization is a key issue for a mobile robot, in particular in environments where a globally accurate positioning system, such as GPS, is not available. In these environments, accurate and efficient robot localization is not a trivial task, as an increase in accuracy usually leads to an impoverishment in efficiency and viceversa. Active perception appears as an appealing way to improve the localization process by increasing the richness of the information acquired from the environment. In this paper, we present an active perception strategy for a mobile robot provided with a visual sensor mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism. The visual sensor has a limited field of view, so the goal of the active perception strategy is to use the pan-tilt unit to direct the sensor to informative parts of the environment. To achieve this goal, we use a topological map of the environment and a Bayesian non-parametric estimation of robot position based on a particle filter. We slightly modify the regular implementation of this filter by including an additional step that selects the best perceptual action using Monte Carlo estimations. We understand the best perceptual action as the one that produces the greatest reduction in uncertainty about the robot position. We also consider in our optimization function a cost term that favors efficient perceptual actions. Previous works have proposed active perception strategies for robot localization, but mainly in the context of range sensors, grid representations of the environment, and parametric techniques, such as the extended Kalman filter. Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are: i) Development of a sound strategy for active selection of perceptual actions in the context of a visual sensor and a topological map; ii) Real time operation using a modified version of the particle filter and Monte Carlo based estimations; iii) Implementation and testing of these ideas using simulations and a real case scenario. Our results indicate that, in terms of accuracy of robot localization, the proposed approach decreases mean average error and standard deviation with respect to a passive perception scheme. Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, the active scheme is able to operate in real time without adding a relevant overhead to the regular robot operation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
Integration of passive and active vision for range calculation in 2D images,"Computer vision is a complicated process. It involves the acquisition of sensed data, extracting relevant information from it and organizing the resulting information in a mathematical and symbolic representation for reasoning purposes. In this paper, we introduce a new method for the acquisition of range information associated with points on 2D images. The irregular triangular mesh (ITM), which is a feature-based modeling technique, is used to synthesize 3D models for the observed scenes. The correspondence between the ITM features and those extracted from the 2D images leads to the integration of active and passive vision. The addition of the range information to 2D intensity images is useful in various applications. While the modeling phase synthesizes the ITM off-line, it is suitable for real-time applications where range information is a key element. Additionally, it is adequate for guiding data acquisition using laser digitizer to acquire the range at selected points of interest. Thus, using monocular vision, accurate 3D knowledge of scenes and objects is synthesized. This technique was tested on a robot cap."
The effect of motor action and different sensory modalities on terrain classification in a quadruped robot running with multiple gaits,"Discriminating or classifying different terrains is an important ability for every autonomous mobile robot. A variety of sensors, preprocessing techniques, and algorithms in different robots were applied. However, little attention was paid to the way sensory data was generated and to the contribution of different sensory modalities. In this work, a quadruped robot traversing different grounds using a variety of gaits is used, equipped with a collection of proprioceptive (encoders on active, and passive compliant joints), inertial, and foot pressure sensors. The effect of different gaits on classification performance is assessed and it is demonstrated that separate terrain classifiers for each motor program should be employed. Furthermore, poor performance of randomly generated motor commands confirms the importance of coordinated behavior on sensory information structuring. The collection of sensors sensitive to active, ""tactile"", terrain exploration proved effective. Among the individual modalities, encoders on passive compliant joints delivered best results."
Active sensorimotor control for tactile exploration,"In this paper, we present a novel and robust Bayesian approach for autonomous active exploration of unknown objects using tactile perception and sensorimotor control. Despite recent advances in tactile sensing, robust active exploration remains a challenging problem, which is a major hurdle to the practical deployment of tactile sensors in robots. Our proposed approach is based on a Bayesian perception method that actively controls the sensor with local small repositioning movements to reduce perception uncertainty, followed by explorative movements based on the outcome of each perceptual decision making step. Two sensorimotor control strategies are proposed for improving the accuracy and speed of the active exploration that weight the evidence from previous exploratory steps through either a weighted prior or weighted posterior. The methods are validated both off-line and in real-time on a contour following exploratory procedure. Results clearly demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and exploration time when using the proposed active methods compared to passive perception. Our work demonstrates that active perception has the potential to enable robots to perform robust autonomous tactile exploration in natural environments."
"Split-Belt walking induces changes in active, but not passive, perception of step length","Successful motor control requires accurate estimation of our body in space for planning, executing, and evaluating the outcome of our actions. It has been shown that the estimation of limb position is susceptible to motor adaptation. However, a similar effect has not been found in locomotion, possibly due to how it was tested. We hypothesized that split-belt walking with the legs moving at different speeds changes the estimation of the legs’ position when taking a step. Thus, we assessed young subjects’ perception of step length (i.e., inter-feet distance at foot landing) when they moved their legs (active perception) or when the legs were moved by the experimenter (passive perception). We found that the active perception of step length was substantially altered following split-belt walking, whereas passive perception exhibited minor changes. This suggests that split-belt walking induced the adaptation of efferent signals, without altering sensory signals. We also found that active perceptual shifts were sensitive to how they were tested: they were most salient in the trailing leg and at short step lengths. Our results suggest that split-belt walking could modulate the deficient perception of step length post-stroke, which may contribute to gait asymmetries impairing patients’ mobility."
The Cat is on the Mat. or is it a Dog? Dynamic competition in perceptual decision making,"Recent neurobiological findings suggest that the brain solves simple perceptual decision-making tasks by means of a dynamic competition in which evidence is accumulated in favor of the alternatives. However, it is unclear if and how the same process applies in more complex, real-world tasks, such as the categorization of ambiguous visual scenes and what elements are considered as evidence in this case. Furthermore, dynamic decision models typically consider evidence accumulation as a passive process disregarding the role of active perception strategies. In this paper, we adopt the principles of dynamic competition and active vision for the realization of a biologically-motivated computational model, which we test in a visual categorization task. Moreover, our system uses predictive power of the features as the main dimension for both evidence accumulation and the guidance of active vision. Comparison of human and synthetic data in a common experimental setup suggests that the proposed model captures essential aspects of how the brain solves perceptual ambiguities in time. Our results point to the importance of the proposed principles of dynamic competition, parallel specification, and selection of multiple alternatives through prediction, as well as active guidance of perceptual strategies for perceptual decision-making and the resolution of perceptual ambiguities. These principles could apply to both the simple perceptual decision problems studied in neuroscience and the more complex ones addressed by vision research. © 2013 IEEE."
Haptic discrimination of distance,"While quite some research has focussed on the accuracy of haptic perception of distance, information on the precision of haptic perception of distance is still scarce, particularly regarding distances perceived by making arm movements. In this study, eight conditions were measured to answer four main questions, which are: what is the influence of reference distance, movement axis, perceptual mode (active or passive) and stimulus type on the precision of this kind of distance perception? A discrimination experiment was performed with twelve participants. The participants were presented with two distances, using either a haptic device or a real stimulus. Participants compared the distances by moving their hand from a start to an end position. They were then asked to judge which of the distances was the longer, from which the discrimination threshold was determined for each participant and condition. The precision was influenced by reference distance. No effect of movement axis was found. The precision was higher for active than for passive movements and it was a bit lower for real stimuli than for rendered stimuli, but it was not affected by adding cutaneous information. Overall, the Weber fraction for the active perception of a distance of 25 or 35 cm was about 11% for all cardinal axes. The recorded position data suggest that participants, in order to be able to judge which distance was the longer, tried to produce similar speed profiles in both movements. This knowledge could be useful in the design of haptic devices. © 2014 van Beek et al."
Passive and active discrimination of natural frequency of virtual dynamic systems,"It has been shown that humans use combined feedforward and feedback control strategies when manipulating external dynamic systems and when exciting virtual dynamic systems at resonance and that they can tune their control parameters in response to changing natural frequencies. We present a study to determine the discrimination thresholds for the natural frequency of such resonant dynamic systems. Weber fractions (WF, %) are reported for the discrimination of 1, 2, 4, and 8 Hz natural frequencies. Participants were instructed either to passively perceive or actively excite the virtual system via a one degree-of-freedom haptic interface with visual and/or haptic feedback. The average WF for natural frequency ranged from 4% to 8.5% for 1, 2, and 4 Hz reference natural frequencies, while the WF was approximately 20% for systems with a reference natural frequency of 8 Hz. Results indicate that sensory feedback modality has a significant effect on WF during passive perception, but no significant effect in the active perception case. The data also suggest that discrimination sensitivity is not significantly affected by excitation mode. Finally, results for systems with equivalent natural frequencies but different spring stiffness indicate that participants do not discriminate natural frequency based on the maximum force magnitude perceived. © 2010 IEEE."
Study on visuo-tactile sensory integration in shape perception,"Experiments on adaptation to distorted visual and tactile rectangles were carried out to investigate interactions between visuo-tactile sensory integration and active perception in shape perception. The interactions have two aspects: the effects of active perception on sensory integration and the effects of sensory integration on active perception. Therefore, the first part of this paper discusses sensory integration with active and passive touch, and the second part discusses the changes of active touch finger movement in the sensory integration process. During the experiments, cross-modal reaction tests were held to evaluate adaptation to the vertical/horizontal ratio of shapes. Amount of sensory integration was estimated by this evaluation. There are two features of sensory integration with active touch: perception with voluntary finger movement and perception with synchronized visual and tactile information. Therefore, comparisons were made first between adaptation experiments with voluntary touch and that with passive touch, and secondly among that with successive visual and tactile stimulation, that with concurrent stimulation, and that with concurrent stimulation with visualized finger movement which strengthened the synchronization. The first comparison showed that adaptation of subjects with voluntary touch was greater than that of those with passive touch. The second comparison showed that adaptation was enhanced by visualized finger movement. Thus, voluntariness and intermodal synchronization of active perception were important factors in sensory integration. In these adaptation experiments, the finger movements by which the subjects actively obtain tactile information of shapes were measured by PSD camera. From position data of the finger, maximum velocities of movement were calculated, and the finger movement system was identified by applying ARMA model. When subjects were exposed to visual and tactile information concurrently either with or without visualized finger movement, maximum velocities of finger movement increased as the experiment proceed. In order to observe changes in finger movement systems, simulations of identified systems were performed. Simulated step responses of finger movement showed that rise time shortened as the experiment proceeded. These results suggested that sensory integration causes a quick response of active touch to visual information. Sensory integration and active perception interact effectively."
Autonomous active exploration for tactile sensing in robotics,"The sense of touch permits humans to directly touch, feel and perceive the state of their surrounding environment. For an exploration task, humans normally reduce uncertainty by actively moving their hands and fingers towards more interesting locations. This active exploration is a sophisticated procedure that involves sensing and perception processes. In robotics, the sense of touch also plays an important role for the development of intelligent systems capable to safely explore and interact with their environment. However, robust and accurate sensing and perception methods, crucial to exploit the benefits offered by the sense of touch, still represents a major research challenge in the field of robotics. A novel method for sensing and perception in robotics using the sense of touch is developed in this research work. This novel active Bayesian perception method, biologically inspired by humans, demonstrates its superiority over passive perception modality, achieving accurate tactile perception with a biomimetic fingertip sensor. The accurate results are accomplished by the accumulation of evidence through the interaction with the environment, and by actively moving the biomimetic fingertip sensor towards better locations to improve perception as humans do. A contour following exploration, commonly used by humans to extract object shape, was used to validate the proposed method using simulated and real objects. The exploration procedure demonstrated the ability of the tactile sensor to autonomously interact, performing active movements to improve the perception from the contour of the objects being explored, in a natural way as humans do. An investigation of the effects on the perception and decisions taken by the combination of the experience acquired along an exploration task with the active Bayesian perception process is also presented. This investigation, based on two novel sensorimotor control strategies (SMC1 and SMC2), was able to improve the performance in speed and accuracy of the exploration task. To exploit the benefits of the control strategies in a realistic exploration, the learning of a forward model and confidence factor was needed. For that reason, a novel method based on the combination of Predicted Information Gain (PIG) and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) permitted to achieve an online and adaptive learning of the forward model and confidence factor, allowing to improve the performance of the exploration task for both sensorimotor control strategies. Overall, the novel methods presented in this thesis, validated in simulated and real environments, demonstrated to be robust, accurate and suitable for robots to perform autonomous active perception and exploration using the sense touch."
Feeling through the World,"This chapter shows how perception of media exemplifies perception in general. It argues that perception of media and art is not an exception to how perception works outside of media use. It discusses the idea that perception is a form of bodily work, and not an automatic or passive phenomenon. This position is opposed to the many theories of mind and theories of media that treat perception as something that just happens automatically. It argues that video games exemplify this active perceptual relationship. The chapter discusses films and video games that pose perceptual and enactive challenges for their users. It shows how ecological theories of perception are appropriate for understanding video game play and understanding media use in general. It illustrates how changing environments and changing technological contexts lead to changes in perception."
